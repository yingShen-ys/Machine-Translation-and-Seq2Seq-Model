now why does that matter to the human health ?
this is a graph of the <unk> of dolphins in the <unk> bay .
and i remember sitting on my desk and thought , &quot; now i know it . what a great scientific discovery , &quot; but it was so awful .
they &apos;re going to be marching around the world , and it &apos;s going to be more like the same reason , and i think we should let go .
when i showed you , i &apos;ve shown you how much we have the ecosystem of monterey bay inflicted through pollution and the <unk> and all the related problems .

we have this ability .
it has changed our modern way of something that has its benefits , but i think we should recognize to what price .
clay shirky , this great <unk> of all networking , has the assumption that &apos;s put up here on the <unk> , in such a wonderful way .
today , there are so many new foundations , the <unk> and investment , people together , together , in common for a goal , in a bigger context .
and i &apos;m hopeful , because not only the philanthropy organized , and other large parts of social <unk> , and in the business of business , the business of social entrepreneurship , in the business , are doing the business of business .
i put this picture close to me . it &apos;s in my office , because i &apos;ve always felt a mystic connection to these two men , i &apos;ve never learned any of them .
now , my own research to cell phones and <unk> shows that 80 percent of all the calls are actually going to four people . 80 percent .
whenever you have a moment , they start with each other .
and with the modern bureaucracy , a very <unk> approach , where there was a clear separation between the private environment and the public environment .
we &apos;re worried that <unk> , sms , facebook of the <unk> intimacy , but <unk> <unk> research shows how the <unk> can promote deeper relationships , to promote love of <unk> and <unk> .
one of the things we developed in the lab -- we have evolved several vehicles -- is , as we think , the first autonomous world &apos;s first autonomous world .
so , for example , the <unk> brain tends to generate a lot of <unk> .
not challenging task .
there &apos;s about a quarter of the spending about 60,000 dollars in a year to send a person in jail .
her family has been around for eight generations in a city called <unk> , west virginia .

i started my company to help communities around the entire country , using their potential potential to improve the entire quality of their people .
and before you don &apos;t have kids , you won &apos;t understand what i mean . &quot;
these deaf people discover at some point in adulthood .
it always takes time .
in fact , guilt is a <unk> against one person , and somebody with down syndrome is not a person . &quot;
in humans , it &apos;s not too much .
but i found that i found the kids i was born , so love that i didn &apos;t want to imagine a life without it .
he didn &apos;t get his legs right .
i come from a privileged family . i &apos;ve been a lot of fortunate .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there you are .
this is the beginning of 2000 . my son , dimitri -- who &apos;s here today , many of you know about -- went to cambodia and hasn &apos;t built by us school , just as she was connected with internet .
remember -- because there are other people like bill gates who said , &quot; man , you have a real computer . &quot;
coffee is also rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won it .
we have no idea for that , not to integrate the prices down to the prices , to keep the prices down down below .
for a <unk> , my apartment is about as alien as space .
and we can take care of the issues of <unk> .
as i said to speak , it was said to be <unk> , even though i don &apos;t know what the party was to nurture or attack .
wealth is people who are not supposed to call a <unk> .
on the subject of taxes , there &apos;s bigger disagreement there .
none of these most important theories was a full of success .
we &apos;re afraid that the world is segregated .
and as a lot of these work we found something , or i found something that really fascinated me , maybe you can remember .
in fact , it &apos;s going on here -- from light to dark in six seconds .
i look at their faces very precisely .
that &apos;s not an expression of happiness .
this lady here even a particularly <unk> face , and both sides are beautiful .
this thing here , it &apos;s light light on it , when you move , so it &apos;s going to get an extraordinary object , even though it &apos;s silent , just how it &apos;s made through the reflection .
i had to change this part , but just about a millimeter .
and that &apos;s what i showed you before , of course , a very complex .
it &apos;s going or loses at that moment .
the emotional ligament between that object and the shape is a <unk> <unk> , which is happening before you even think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to make that choice .
it &apos;s also a thought we have forgotten .
i think it &apos;s needed to return to the tradition of sermon .
we didn &apos;t think like that .
and at the end of the day , they all stand up and say , &quot; thanks a mean , thanks to be plato , thank you jane austen . &quot;
the other thing is that art is not going to explain that artists should not be able to tell their stories , because when they <unk> them , the magic , and we might just figure it out .
art is one of the tools that we can do to improve our society .
we may not agree with what religion want us to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way that they do it .

because you get to 90 percent , because you &apos;ve got a similar view of so many things , and you &apos;ve got other opinion to the place of other people .
so it led me from places like chile -- the <unk> desert in chile -- in the underground mines , in north america , north america , to antarctica , and even to the south pole .
it &apos;s the largest seas of the world . it &apos;s 800 km long .
and they &apos;re not going to believe it , but that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be called a big telescope .
that shack was built by robert <unk> scott and his men when she came to antarctica , on her first expedition on the south pole .
so , if you look at these all of these things in extreme cold , in <unk> temperatures .
this is an interesting statement , i &apos;ll come back on the end of that .
what people are doing first is <unk> <unk> that you can look for inside the book , and that &apos;s fun .
it was quite a lot of people there .
but how do we scan them all ?
we &apos;ve reached the 10 cents per page when we work with big volume .
i &apos;m not sure what &apos;s exactly describing exactly .
there &apos;s about two or three <unk> .
at 15 dollars a hour and a half a hour and about 100 to 150 dollars per hour , we can put materials on online <unk> online , and put it on the web .
the question is , is that the world where we want to live ?
they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
we all know that the world has trouble .
spores of spores , <unk> them .
when you go through the landscape , put it up into your shoes and try to react with the safest place .
across all the time .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is a extraordinary rare <unk> .
i did something that no one else would have done .
the box of life -- you get a dvd from the ted conference -- you give soil to water and water , and you have both <unk> and <unk> fungi , like spores , like <unk> mushrooms .
i &apos;ve also lived in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know , is life adaptive enough ?
i kind of ate myself on myself .
and the doctor looked at care of us , whether it &apos;s really good at us .
and all of them went to me .
<unk> , a part of ethiopia , is one of these places that are beautiful and incredibly <unk> , and i have no idea how people can do it to live there .
this , this beautiful image , that &apos;s the amazon .
this is actually a <unk> .
and i had to think about how you <unk> and <unk> , but also about how you choose the right person that comes into a <unk> .
you put it in the <unk> , you drop blood , you blow the blood , look under the microscope , put it under the microscope , the culture , you put the culture , you put the culture .
but we need a <unk> , pit crews for patients .
and so , sometimes the medicine feels sometimes .
we &apos;ve been looking for <unk> , we looked at the <unk> , and we found that they have technology and education , and then they have a thing : they have checklists .
and it &apos;s very hard to do .
so that &apos;s really a lot of bees , and that &apos;s very relevant .
so what that means is that articulating your dead people can replace very well and think of the losses .
they take their hives and their bodies rise to their families for twice a year .
bj : but it &apos;s in the minorities .
let &apos;s take a burrow in new york with one of 15,000 bats , now it &apos;s still 1,000 . that &apos;s like san francisco , in three years , the population of half a <unk> .
now , now , not all of us have released , or the lawn that we can transform , and so you can always get a meadow in a meadow .
and i was also at the holy evening with my wife &apos;s family .
and to defend my title -- like <unk> and other words that do -- i thought i &apos;d do this in 2005 , and won again .
that &apos;s very promising .
why ?
the earthquake , the largest living organism on our planet . that &apos;s wrong , it &apos;s totally wrong .
during the night , you roll their leaves , and you reduce the movement , and during the day , the leaves opened -- there &apos;s a lot more movement .

now , kids aren &apos;t <unk> yet , are a special fall .
they &apos;re a kind of <unk> .
the discovered of developments through natural selection are brilliant , incredibly awesome .
that &apos;s what we did on this <unk> .
the ant isn &apos;t alone .
you &apos;ve just heard this man .
i really appreciate that .
now i don &apos;t think that .
now maybe we should take it out .
it &apos;s the devil that speaks . &quot;
so , they &apos;re actually a chord , and each of them is a self-organizing chord .

we can predict how this is going to sound .
it &apos;s also going to be a mission for space , hopefully within the next 10 years . it &apos;s called lisa .
it &apos;s getting closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;ve got <unk> .
trees &apos;s wedding gridlock .
i think that &apos;s movement .
we are critical towards the west , the view of the west , which is our identity -- the picture of us , about our policy , about our policy , about our religion , about our religion .

she said , &quot; who is this charles bonnet ? &quot;
once , for instance , when his <unk> went him , he said , &quot; and who are these handsome young men ? &quot;

thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , everything about frostbite and difficulties running around and <unk> -- cold , individual conditions .
first of all , we developed a little experiment where we gave people out and they asked them to build something .
and if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were this <unk> , we have the other what they &apos;d just built , again again .
there was a very nice relationship between the love to lego and the number of active legos .

<unk> is also really cool .
a friend , a colleague , a colleague , dr. hans <unk> at <unk> university was also working with <unk> .
the people always say , &quot; why do you do that ?

it could definitely be done by people here in the audience .
if we had the chance 350 years ago , we &apos;d have been talking about the inspired innovations of military , about the massive <unk> , like <unk> , and we would have been able to predict an era of stability in the world or in europe .
now , in this environment , where you don &apos;t know whether the potential was to stop or attack the attack , and if the weapons of the attack , that environment is that what most of the time is necessary to have a conflict .

so i don &apos;t have slides , you &apos;re going to have to go with me .
now , the research agency in africa has shown that there &apos;s a clear <unk> in 28 african countries .
the state should not interfere with the creation of goods and services because it &apos;s inefficient and <unk> is on this area .
but what it immediately was , was the variation that had dominated our economic development -- meaning when the oil prices was high , our economy grew very fast .
we &apos;re doing the same thing .
because i &apos;d love to tell you that you &apos;re seeing this .
he called them : &quot; massively fatal discontinuity , &quot; which means that you could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t have to know how a vaccine was happening .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that it &apos;s constantly changing .
these drugs are not a cure , but they make a huge triumph of science , because they have the passing death of a <unk> at least for the people who have access to them .
but you know , the research that happened in hiv has helped us with the progress of other diseases .
this was a slow , <unk> process that was dependent upon <unk> , millions of living chicken .
and just the radical <unk> production and the vast <unk> of e. coli , for example , that i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the time of time -- look at the time of time -- that would be <unk> life .
so the challenge is to predict full force .
the question is : why ?
do you think the african union is going to organize such a conference ?
there are some things you need to know .
the speaker who was sitting here in front of me on stage , <unk> mohamed , that we had <unk> leaders in africa .
by expressing it from your <unk> people .
traditionally africans hate the africans -- they hate tyranny .
they decide what they do .
he doesn &apos;t get help from government , and he builds a second , <unk> boat .
something that would connect us all to each other .
scott &apos;s results were full of them .
and the challenge for algorithmic filter , this personalized filter , is that it &apos;s grounded with this balance , because it &apos;s going to be in front of what you click on first .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> to new ideas , and to new people and strangers .
and the man replied , &quot; very nice <unk> , what ? &quot;
i know you &apos;ll wait on more bad <unk> -- i &apos;m just kidding -- but now comes only a little playback , and then i &apos;m going to show you a little bit of new material about possible solutions .
until then in may , it &apos;s going to be an update on version 2.0 , where you can then move directly to the purchase of <unk> .
again , all the republicans here : it &apos;s not supposed to be about <unk> .
what excites me about the people in the gulf is that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s where no one &apos;s trying to do , except a few people trying to use the beach .
what we &apos;ve learned is that bacteria eat ?
this <unk> is all the ocean .
when the japanese <unk> harbor <unk> , they cover at least .
which is the <unk> of birds , i don &apos;t want to do a <unk> comments about people , the birds .
okay , people who think of themselves as conservative , if they really wanted to be really <unk> and right , then they should send those <unk> to the <unk> .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve developed a system to produce medical isotopes .
all right , i &apos;m more than my genes -- all in common .
i didn &apos;t ask you to <unk> it because it &apos;s true , but it &apos;s true to remember it .
they contain a molecule that we know as an incubator .
and that &apos;s just a <unk> . it &apos;s much smaller than a human <unk> .
now , neurons , as well as trees , new soil can grow and old .
and we can even talk about the amur falcon .
if you look at that number , you can easily make that there &apos;s a big potential for <unk> in your brain .
perhaps this technique is going to be able to be able to be able to know ourselves through , and put our own brains .
it &apos;s mostly about professors and commercials with his company , the <unk> .
so we &apos;ve got a quick experiment here to show you that .
ks : no , no .
while he did this , he realized a unexpected thing .
ks : how does that work : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
currently , isn &apos;t it ?
and a few months ago , a friend of mine sent me a link to this guy , eduardo sousa .
a huge scandal for a few weeks .
but he still did this .
so the farm is incredible .
and then he found these wild plants , the <unk> .
and then they fly in circle .
i finally came to try and try it before i went .
no salt , no pepper , no oil , no spices .
what the hell does that mean ?
at least <unk> . i think it &apos;s .
farmers that rely on nature to find solutions to find answers , instead of nature &apos;s solutions .
and from the old one to change the new fire , which is to change two great stories about oil and electricity that are both two-thirds of the fossil fuels in air .
our fuel for mobility goes to three degrees of cars .
you can make it quiet . it &apos;s tougher than titan .
the planes and airplanes can use realistic hydrogen or advanced biofuels .
even better light and <unk> and so forth , the last one third is about a third .
in about 20 <unk> , the private <unk> of private solar panels , without a financial losses , on their rooftops and lower their <unk> .
and what we &apos;re used to replace it , it &apos;s going to be about the same cost : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- let &apos;s buy more of what we have or new nuclear , or renewable <unk> , or renewable plants that are more or less centralized .
so on the results , and not motivations , focus , can be <unk> and conflict with the <unk> solution of america &apos;s rights solution .
i realized that what i ate was two <unk> of his entire family .
this simple <unk> shows that donors in areas where the least children are going to school , don &apos;t funded any schools . this is true new questions , are the ones that you need most of them ?
two years ago , at the 15th april 2010 , i called my father .
i &apos;m not trying to design the toothbrush .
we remember , can we look at this in every book of my <unk> son , that life arose four billion years ago -- four billion nobel laureates two ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there &apos;s fallen ; there &apos;s a trap : the vertical line .
you have time to think of time , you have time to talk about art and things like that .
you go back to the future , back , back , back , back , like that .
they &apos;re all coming from families where mostly are a person at home , usually the mother or grandmother , and they come here for their education and their structure .
we &apos;re going to bring them to the right and the left , so they can tell , and the consequences know , when they give orders .
let you all go online . &quot;
it &apos;s unpredictable .
they said , &quot; that &apos;s enough for <unk> .
then you can support ourselves . that &apos;s the task of you guys . &quot;
but i have to have my hotdog .
you can listen and touch .
let &apos;s take a look for example .
when you think about the concept of wikipedia , which everyone is at the content , and at the end , you have the greatest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
one website was created .
there was no leader .
extremism has become tolerance .
the modern tools of neuroscience show us that what &apos;s happening there is an incredibly complex process .
we can hold sounds of our own language apart apart , but not the foreign languages .
we &apos;ve been watching this by watching american babies who never heard a second language at the beginning of the critical period of time .
it might look like a <unk> from mars .
science on one side has a very rational view of its environment , whereas art on the other hand usually a emotional approach to its environment .
now i have a <unk> over here to show you that .
so let me demonstrate this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion .
the rags were <unk> by a little girl , whose body was burned .
it &apos;s part of every human being .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we vote with compassion ?
the wound in front of us .
assuming you like squares , and frankly , who doesn &apos;t like you ?
we start with a <unk> , and then we &apos;re going to put another <unk> next .
then there was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s already living dead .
&quot; i got what <unk> ! ? &quot; &quot; i didn &apos;t get a memo . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what do you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the lobby , and i saw this indian guy .
marco tempest : when you ask him to deception , he said : &quot; oh is the only thing that &apos;s going to be done . &quot;
where &apos;s the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how emotional terrorism is connected with our everyday life .
at the time i interviewed the red brigades , i discovered that their life was not driven by ideology and politics , but by economic constraints .
i think a lot of people thought i even thought about a little <unk> .
but most of all , it was organized by organized crime with organized crime .
this money was deposited in <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- in pub , understanding .
no one wants to control his mating vitality and control his <unk> with people &apos;s own <unk> . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
some of you might be thinking , &quot; wait a minute . she doesn &apos;t really look like a <unk> .
sure , i was going to leave my <unk> , but what i didn &apos;t perceived was , it was extremely sensitive to leave his <unk> .
and i really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the greater the feeling of a special achievement , when you go to the end .
now , i thought the atlantic was big , but the pacific is really big .
but it didn &apos;t go without <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green light on the horizon , which she makes very nervous because of the rising seas .
we can begin to make better ways of making sustainable choices .
<unk> <unk> : why i went across the pacific
this is the world trade organization on the front page .
why ? why ? why do you want to do that ?
it doesn &apos;t look any thick cost . it doesn &apos;t take any extra time .
they were able to make that .
and then it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about being good at places that they hadn &apos;t felt good about before .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give up my dreams ?
it &apos;s not that hard , somebody <unk> , and one day before the school , i said , &quot; sure you can <unk> my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answer that i had <unk> in the night before .
we were getting stuck in the back room in the class , so that we wouldn &apos;t be bombarded with <unk> .
maybe you get your <unk> and energy-efficient teeth , but you never tell them about , because how can you say , if all of you , you &apos;re going to be looking at you around you ?
this is french science .
all right , let &apos;s go .
when you look at these trucks here , it &apos;s the biggest trucks of his species on earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the biggest and the fastest growing <unk> of carbon dioxide in canada , and it &apos;s also why canada is now the number three is in terms of <unk> per capita .
and as a father , i can &apos;t imagine what &apos;s going to be a soul .
by doing that , we &apos;re going to take a large part of our largest <unk> and recursively replace it with the most greenhouse gases of the future .
the <unk> of their work is the <unk> that you can buy in any store and put the millions of indian women every day on their forehead . it &apos;s a ritual that stands tightly with the institution of marriage .
<unk> shaw was born in <unk> , <unk> and in london .
i hope you can convince them that complex and complicated is not always the same .
the <unk> <unk> is the one that we want to affect -- public support for government .
so , in my first tedtalk , that we should spend as a planet 21 billion hours a week of video games .
it &apos;s only 30 minutes of <unk> per day for a major improvement in the mood and <unk> increase in happiness .
why a game ?
so how could an <unk> game make a huge effect in so hard , sometimes <unk> situations ?
there are four types of strength , or resilience to post-traumatic growth , and there are scientifically <unk> things that you can do every day to build these resilience , you don &apos;t need trauma .
more practice , it &apos;s going to be empowered .
so , here &apos;s another mystery for you : if you shake somebody &apos;s hand for six seconds , it &apos;s going to be greatly <unk> in your blood , which is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in fact , in this project , we &apos;re actually living around hundreds of people around the world , doing that with us . actually thousands of people involved in this project is involved in this project , in many of his different aspects .
and then a few people came out of chicago and they said , &quot; end 2007 is the motto of the chicago festival , the global warming . we have a secondary square meter , and we want them to fill them with their reef . &quot;
and <unk> and <unk> are not two concepts that fit well .
<unk> said , &quot; how can i define parallel lines ? &quot;
<unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . very specific .
so we have , from wool , in <unk> canada , the evidence that the most famous <unk> of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual notions , and their employment with this mathematical approach .
this particular <unk> property -- the self-confidence -- i think , in my opinion , the holy grail of neuroscience , neuroscience , and sometime we will hopefully understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is otherwise at <unk> mind and intelligent , but when he sees his mother , his delusion , and he says it &apos;s not his mother .
so if that area is damaged , you lose the ability to recognize faces .
and pepper and chairs -- nothing happens , just like regular people , but if i show him a picture of his mother , the <unk> activity is low .
he knows his arm isn &apos;t there . nonetheless , it &apos;s an intentional , <unk> experience .
maybe if you can solve the <unk> , the spasm in the phantom .
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days i had no phantom , and thus no longer <unk> anymore in the elbow , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> . all my pain are gone .
<unk> is blue ; f is green , another sound could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is kiki , which is buba ?
her <unk> is too <unk> , which most of us don &apos;t worry about .
that &apos;s kanzi .
none of the things you &apos;ll see in this video are <unk> .
good job .
he has learned that when he &apos;s both hands with his hands , with his <unk> <unk> , a lot of larger and <unk> <unk> .
one frame is a shack in the forest .
see where the sound comes from ?
because we think it &apos;s not biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in spectacular families that are leaving these remains remains .
on the right hand side , it &apos;s gravity . einstein has explained that .
and beyond that , you get new kinds of transformation .
it was too early to me , but he was a moral imperative , an inspiration for scientists who were worried about the control of the guns .
let &apos;s take extraterrestrial creatures , we would have been living by far outside of the cosmos in the cosmos , and not only about 40 years , but the whole <unk> billion years of the earth .
martin rees asks : is this our last century ?
and it &apos;s going to be worse , &quot; then i would make a picture of it and make a dozen <unk> .
now , these are undergraduates , so they gave a lot of the money for things like <unk> and make-up .
and then we asked them how happy they are .
but huge different incentives .
these are <unk> in belgium .
the teams that we gave money to bring it back to other teams and judaism at the end , actually the league .
when we hear today about the <unk> , from high school , we often think that this is one of these <unk> conflict of the middle east , where the region is as old as the region itself .
ironically , that was at a time when the <unk> of iran had the peace with washington , and not the destruction of israel .
this is an analogy that focuses on this , diplomacy &apos;s diplomacy , the diplomacy is inevitable , is inevitable .
you can look for specific <unk> , or you can look at the different regions and compare it .
the map of port <unk> at the end of 2009 was not as good as it could have been , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is .
on the explanation she said , he said , &quot; he was not a environmentalists . &quot;
this system wants to attract the status quo , even the status quo .
so it &apos;s not that my theme is the most important . that &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
lawrence lessig : we , the citizens , have to regain the republic
so , for instance , a couple of individuals in this room are going to be able to go to school with a scholarship to school .
that &apos;s on my pen . &quot;
each one is just a little bit psychopathic .
i don &apos;t want to tell you that the law of entropy doesn &apos;t lie , it &apos;s true .
this is the model of the aral sea .
when you see in north america , they are like so many things in the united states , and they &apos;re in the united states . they ignore each other .
each of their <unk> depends on this critical region , which is about the 10,000 independent cells , which each <unk> , a electronic rhythm -- a high tension -- a high tension -- to send the <unk> of a signal to the pump .
they were a little while ago , but then , apart .
so i &apos;d like to show you a couple of interviews to people who were to the opening on the bridge and describe what happened .
now you don &apos;t usually think of a metronome , but we &apos;re all running -- we &apos;re all going to run ahead and run .
am : this weighs just a few tons , so she &apos;s pretty quick now .
it &apos;s the <unk> scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in <unk> order , and i told them , they should search for their names , their <unk> , or the <unk> of their mother .
and also , maybe this <unk> , or maybe a <unk> , which is not worth caring about disease , a resilience of disease , or pests or another property that &apos;s useful for climate change , and the other ones don &apos;t have .
we &apos;re going to see kids on tv .
so the idea of svalbard was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under the <unk> .
and when something happens , you can come and pick it up .
thank you .
look at your body ! this is not right .
maybe any queen , a queen ? -- thank you very much .
you &apos;ve tried only two concepts -- two in the u.s. , and one on the russians .
<unk> ! i &apos;ve got to talk briefly about research -- the things that are developing , there &apos;s a lot of activity , and then you &apos;re going to be replaced through something else and dying .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going to go , because i don &apos;t want to know that the competition would know it .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of development exploration .
it &apos;s like the air .
and after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give up , but one day he &apos;s got a epiphany .
institutions are going to be naked , and when you &apos;re nude , well , has the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle is <unk> .
the toothpaste is from the <unk> .
you know that bees and fish live in life .
all around us to find a medical revolution , a revolution that will help us tease some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer , with including .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , an <unk> mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the supply chain after the treatment .
but the real question is : how good work that work in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> . it &apos;s using angiogenesis in very efficient .
but even more interesting from the trial came out that the men who have evolved to be <unk> , so the ones that have more tomato sauce , in the end , had less blood vessels that have food .
once von <unk> once said that &quot; discoveries is to see what all already have seen , and think what nobody else has thought . &quot;
i &apos;ve been magazine at the discover magazine club .
it has to be fun , different than everyday problems that honestly don &apos;t really say really well <unk> .
one is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that physically , but it &apos;s on a computer . it &apos;s over to the pc .
i wanted to make a sequel .
now , what are the ones that are going to be falling down here ?
so there are games like &quot; brain age &quot; for the nintendo , an <unk> .
looks like a black character . where is that ?
i really think that &apos;s a girl , so powerful that we all had to train to be not like that .
i remember , like my father , who was very , very violent , me .
we &apos;re so used to be afraid of the <unk> of your own life , that we &apos;re actually doing it to objects and you have been turned into it .
and she looked into her baby &apos;s eyes and she said , &quot; of course , i love my baby . how could i love my baby ?
when we were there , they conducted a ritual where they were girls who were <unk> , with their families .
and i &apos;ll be on the rest of your life on your side . &quot;
i love that i &apos;m not going to take things very easily .
why should you want me to be <unk> , <unk> ?
so in the actual process , all six teenagers stepped out and <unk> the <unk> that they had done through the photo .
but the incident happened in the middle of january , in the northern hemisphere , at 7 o &apos;clock .
that &apos;s 10 meters away .
and what &apos;s this important thing -- what &apos;s important to us in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> and traveling one year from africa , where i asked people why they were building fractals , which is a great job when you can get it .
and that happens in some villages until the smallest level .
it &apos;s not really math knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the room , i would only use a long time lapse , because it &apos;s very cheap , and it &apos;s very cheap .
it &apos;s taking advantage of odd results .
we have in ghana , in ghana .
but the bad news is .
instead of taking friends or relatives , they called the workplace .
today , <unk> development is applied in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s going to go up into the <unk> .
the fear of losing leadership . human beds .
we put a bunch of rules and hold on them .
the conversation will run better . &quot;
when i was here tonight , when i came to get here tonight , one of my daughters started <unk> .
and we developed 10 statements .
i was a teenager when i first read &quot; anna <unk> &quot; and the famous first sentence read , &quot; all happy families .
i &apos;d like to show you how something that might be beautiful as beautiful .
when i put this into the water here , you see a <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> is the <unk> that holds the water from the <unk> of the <unk> . it &apos;s dry .
and plato with all the young boys in his cave . sweeney : <unk> ...
i &apos;ll show it to you .
but most successful success was not about duration .
one of the things i want to leave you is that not all <unk> are all around .
we can look at them or be <unk> , or we can do it .
it &apos;s one of five children .
i &apos;ve shown you that we can apply it to the circuits of the probability of depression .
we &apos;re to see what these circuits are and what areas are responsible for clinical signs and symptoms of these diseases .
evolution operates really , really , as an engineer as an engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human , or a crab or a crab or a crab , the relative <unk> of this feather is the same for all that we &apos;ve seen before .
okay . the point is , it &apos;s really hard to say , right ? it &apos;s incredible , students have tried it , and they couldn &apos;t tell you .
he &apos;s doing this with a <unk> glue .
what we do is we take the hair as a model , and put them together with another colleague of berkeley .
in fact , from the <unk> <unk> leaders , two-thirds of the <unk> men have children , but only one third of the most <unk> women .
at monday , i left san francisco , my <unk> , and flew at this conference .
and we &apos;re going out at the end , looking at us and say , &quot; how did it go ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous trial at harvard business school about a woman named heidi <unk> .
and i got my hand again and i noticed that in all other women , and then you &apos;ve got more questions , only by men . &quot;
a woman contacted me , and i looked at her -- she looked a little bit more .
thank you .
they don &apos;t pretend to do it as they should , but they do it .
so , fear was the <unk> factor .
but it &apos;s true in the middle of the center .
now , i want to talk to you in the next talk about how we &apos;re dealing with in this country , how we get to information .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re here in <unk> , language language . and that works .
we tell them that everything is all wrong ; they &apos;re good at it .
this patient is about 50 , we can pretty much tell you how big his risk is to get prostate prostate cancer .
you don &apos;t need to have the educational level of audiences in this room .
and that bee has been shown to me , &quot; i &apos;m going to do this <unk> , that flower , i get the nectar and then i &apos;m going to go . &quot;
and when you talk about nature , which is the author of my favorite subject , how does the idea of <unk> ?
all right , we &apos;re all <unk> .
the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : pretty new , on a <unk> , even i could have a <unk> of 10 knots in 15 minutes in 15 minutes .
when a <unk> <unk> , the grass &apos;s going to go from this sea level , and it immediately happens something interesting .
and now i say that i want to build one layer of games on the planet , but that &apos;s not quite true , because it &apos;s already happening in development ; it &apos;s going to happen .
if you don &apos;t , it &apos;s a pity . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
come to a certain time , you get your drinks to half a year .
and then they can really reach in different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a collective dynamic , which tries to find the best news that &apos;s exciting stories .
we &apos;ve been talking the last time a few years ago .
you can also see when i turn this around here -- hopefully i don &apos;t get too much of the world too much .
you can see , here it started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , who actually should have been teaching students , discovered the law of <unk> , just as a hobby , as a hobby .
raise your hands .
that makes it a place where it &apos;s fun to work .
and so that &apos;s what we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about this and crazy enough that they work on it , that &apos;s really your goal .
thank you .
what brunel said , how he said to him for his occupants , was the experience of taking through the landscape . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
what does life make life simple , enjoyable ?
in part of it , she <unk> this by making a great new facility , the basement of one of their hospitals used . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
today , the industrial systems of the world have been <unk> , and it &apos;s actually part of the present problem .
and as brunel can we do , by looking at systems , we can have a bigger impact .
from my breakfast , i was surprised by the waiter with his boss .
mark <unk> , and i have tried to answer that question exactly that question .
nevertheless , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm requires .
but for the <unk> , the sudden availability of all these <unk> were on the market like a <unk> .
the americans itself discover that <unk> choices are more attractive in the theory than in practice .
<unk> parents would say things like , &quot; noah was only for such a brief time , but he taught us so much .
robert frost once said that , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost in translation . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very elegant <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re multinational problems that are controlled by forces .
so thank you very much .
it should replace competition through collaboration .
and then we &apos;re building a <unk> that we can test the maximum performance of machines , and so we can get very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so i realized that the <unk> didn &apos;t work as a <unk> , but as an <unk> movement .
the <unk> enter the stage .
and then the 92 increased leaders that would provide the energy to the rest of los angeles .
and then you take it and put it on the screen on the screen , and you get off the inside out , just like that .
now , if you replace the word or the internet today , it &apos;s very true that your perception is now very awkward now . let &apos;s hear that .
i think it was this exchange that led to pcs .
ph : i hope you &apos;ll understand how <unk> that is .
ultimately , the race has won the future of momentum as the phone company .
mm : because it gave the audience a role to do something .
they make things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where tv shows what &apos;s going to be built , a very exciting new kind of communication , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking to see it . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this is a spanish architect and designers .
color can simple blocks , simple materials : when i go through new york , i &apos;ll stop .
it gave me suggestions -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk about it and build a few installations .
the stakes that the city has been doing for the public space , is relevant , almost a international model .
even the bits of the airplane had french <unk> .
he said , &quot; well , firstly , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and that was , as i was , after some <unk> and <unk> , the design of the chair that i &apos;m going to show you right now .
he said she got one of the new , better chairs .
or they pull them up into the position .
but i knew it from experience , and when i was in the offices , where it was <unk> with <unk> , which was never anyone would come to the idea , <unk> , to turn on a <unk> and to fit the headrest to get them into position .
and yet , <unk> has virally in <unk> .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remember exactly , i read in a <unk> that <unk> the first <unk> <unk> , about 52 <unk> cases , with about 400 <unk> cases .
we need something that was really <unk> , so that it &apos;s not prevalent the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : male is the females , a lot of offspring .
so rovs aren &apos;t our biggest problem .
&quot; why are now ? &quot; why ?
and most of the time , i was barely worried about this , even though i was a <unk> <unk> .
look at the available data .
now , our mobile phones can actually construct a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : their health depended on where they live .
that &apos;s my grandfather .
it &apos;s the simple reason that no one &apos;s talking about it .
it &apos;s how it explains how to go through water from the ground .
here &apos;s the title of a remarkable article from a <unk> of &quot; nature , &quot; which is the discussion about the phosphorus crisis .
eighty percent of them are going to be dead .
and instead of 100 percent of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology , and one that &apos;s going to be using some of the <unk> use some of the <unk> that we &apos;re doing to the <unk> of the world .
and he was a <unk> <unk> : he looked at all the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you can see the individual steps repeat , but they repeat , without being <unk> .
as an architect , i just think of relationships between the parts and the whole , but in terms of respect , it &apos;s always going to be a matter of enterprise .
we were able to build ourselves at the <unk> of the building , where we could build the five separate towers , but you should all <unk> on the 60 floor to a single <unk> mass .
when we come back , a few years later , 2003 , and we &apos;re going to see that landscape is actually quite frankly that this landscape actually looks like <unk> .
most of the difference in the desert is in the desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever you want .
so there &apos;s a lot of toxic waste , a lot of things that are illegal and now on the air now .
we have doubled the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just by fertilizers , creating huge problems of water quality , rivers , lakes and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important investment for <unk> .
but we can do that , and there are opportunities there .
flipping is the biggest contributor on the ground floor .
to work together .
so , what is that , what is the toxic system ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system d is not taxes .
we &apos;re interacting with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we &apos;re using biological leaders to amplify these <unk> . muscles .
this is what it looks like .
this is where we <unk> , or cut the nerve off , from small parts of the fittest , and let others give us our <unk> -- signal . two other people that would give us our hand -- signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t put an electrode on and say , &quot; there . &quot;
and that &apos;s our goal -- something clinically <unk> to have .
this is jesse , and he presses a <unk> .
so thanks very much .
nevertheless combines these conditions largely , since there are 22 million people living with hiv , that are 25 percent of the 30 million people around the world .
governments in the world have to have non-lethal candidates for ethical events in clinical trials in clinical trials , which are going to be authorized in the different developing world . <unk> findings , which are independent by government and the <unk> of the trial .
so the fundamental problems we &apos;re faced with are a too high consumption and too many people .
so they &apos;re going to satisfy all of the criteria that people typically enjoy .
so you see this power that goes north -- the <unk> in this case -- it &apos;s going to go to the galapagos , and that <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , which is at the edge of the galapagos .
we also know that not only aren &apos;t threatened , but as well as the other <unk> and other forms .
i want to show you that penguins are going to be picked up in <unk> .
leah has <unk> , with his <unk> to the door , and we put him in it , and he &apos;s here in here .
and then there &apos;s another one that comes up with <unk> .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have solved : our basic political geography .
the two are a pretty long threshold .
again , like in the case of mongolia , china doesn &apos;t <unk> russia . it <unk> it .
for <unk> countries , china has reduced china , so that <unk> and cambodia have been able to sell their goods and be addicted to china .
what i want to show you here is i call <unk> , day after day .
these two arrows form a bow , a arc of <unk> and other infrastructure that connects the west bank with the gaza .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? what &apos;s the future of european union ?
why countries and by far most of the suspect straight lines on the map .
this dream exists .
is it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the hormone igf-1 promote growth .
so how can a hormone turn the speed end of aging ?
we think that insulin and igf-1 are hormones , which are particularly under <unk> conditions -- in good times -- if food is present to the center , not much stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo gene has a impact on the life of humans .
and you can see the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process that i &apos;ve been talking about , which is very , very quickly , a different normal <unk> , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
you &apos;ll never see such a readout , because nike wants to buy your shoes .
they all show the heroes that have been <unk> .
it &apos;s like trying to run a <unk> .
this view of this is because a lot of <unk> <unk> like prozac represented basically the chemistry of the brain as if in fact , in fact , the brain of a chemical soup .
and my colleague colleague seymour <unk> .
so through the <unk> we found that a two-wheeler , much longer needed to go back after the <unk> , and when we were able to reset the genes that were played in this mutation , we could detect a <unk> .
so this question has been asking for a long time , but we can actually fly it .
so , in the dark , we find ourselves in the dark by changing us . they smell to us .
so you can see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;re going to be bitten by mosquitos .
in <unk> , <unk> .
and every time i felt the <unk> look at the eyes of the eyes .
and it turns out , it &apos;s fat one of the greatest sources for adult stem cells .
as we speak , roughly <unk> clinical trial studies from the use of stem cells for <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy because we have the opportunity to have that angels in the world , not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when that doesn &apos;t happen ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
i can &apos;t tell you anything about that , because i stopped on the headline .
<unk> <unk> : why you don &apos;t know about marriage
but how ?
it &apos;s even better . it seems that we can make these receivers , using the material that dna is encoded in dna .
the animal &apos;s freezing , it has its wings out of it , it <unk> these , but it can &apos;t really look like , because the flies are trapped between two <unk> .
to a intelligent creature like our fly , that rule isn &apos;t going to be divided into stone , but changing as the animal learns through experience . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt
so through many of these experiments , we were able to put the identity of the critic &apos;s identity to 12 cells .
there &apos;s a couple of ideas in the <unk> and artificial intelligence , how you could do that , but we still haven &apos;t solved a single example of how smart behavior of the physical interactions on living matter .
here &apos;s plausible , or actually a <unk> of libby .
ed : all right . tb : okay . a little bit more , a little bit more to the center .
in fact , i know that hospitals can be a very dangerous place to be a very dangerous place .
this is a picture from my <unk> from the <unk> .
i &apos;m going to tell you this kind of <unk> , which is all generated , from your goals to your genes , the <unk> transformation that we &apos;re going to see in health care .
they don &apos;t tolerate like a velcro nor <unk> or glue .
here we have the robot .
marc <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you look at the underside of the <unk> , and it would come in a <unk> or we would shake the sheet ? &quot;
and so <unk> did . and it &apos;s doing this .
and of course , very different than you could see that in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at the rising seas .
and i would say that people are working in the ocean and thinking about goals , we think that they should be much lower .
this is the ship that i was the last three months in antarctica .
when this ice melts rise to six meters after sea level .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news is the <unk> of the galapagos islands .
your relationship gives you the temperature .
but then at the end , you look at the <unk> in black .
we &apos;ve got very interesting opportunities in the atmosphere of millions of years , we &apos;ve only done it with <unk> , but in this case , we go back 20 million years .
and this is the task that einstein asked : figure out how gravity works .
so einstein had already space and time , warps and curves to describe gravity .
but deep in the fabric of the room , the idea , there could be more dimensions than we see there .
and just as the strings of a cello might look different , the ones that are able to look at the strings in different patterns as well .
not yet .
is this just an interesting mathematical design that might be able to explain some of the <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually tell these extra dimensions ?
so we &apos;ve got two plates here with colored dots .
now , can you see the predator , which is what &apos;s going on .
and what &apos;s true for sensorial information , generally , for all information .
and we &apos;re looking at about 30 seconds on what a great hammer is in a 18 minutes long talk .
why ? because when the bow in this shadow actually would be in the shadows , and the same amount of light on its eye would reflect , like the <unk> outside of the shadow , they would have to reflect more than the <unk> .
how do you know that ?
and it &apos;s coming in the beehive , there &apos;s a blank <unk> , and it &apos;s friendly -- and that &apos;s honey .
he finds him . insane , isn &apos;t it ?
if you you ? yes ?
there &apos;s no right here , right ?
in new york , in new york .
we &apos;re also a species of storytellers .
now , some things : understanding of safety , the risks , the <unk> , how they work .
but in the modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks we &apos;re faced with .
think of cancer , bird flu , swine flu .
there were no new findings , but less anxiety .
and there &apos;s another cognitive dissonance : i call it <unk> by putting data into the data that &apos;s going on to our <unk> and data that &apos;s led to our <unk> <unk> . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i was teaching a different group , realizing if my plane was secure to fly with it .
this is what people do .
and it was found at stanford here in stanford .
they had good writing with their teachers , students .
let me ask you a few questions to find out if that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
i took anybody who sat down to preserve them or save them , where i could sing myself as a volunteer , but i found that nobody did something .
we opened the first section of 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in the sky
and groups were called terrorists very often called terrorists .
you need a <unk> process , which is the core of this very complicated society with its problems .
it &apos;s because we &apos;re likely to see a revolution in the arab world of the arab world : a <unk> .
and i think of that is that the <unk> decade was so successful . and that &apos;s from a main reason .
at once , the ngos of their tomato sauce are not only on the roads -- but they took them into negotiations , in part , because they <unk> the victims of these weapons .
thank you very much .
but i don &apos;t think &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so this was completely smooth .
it &apos;s a little crazy to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the movie ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and the last day comes out , the sun comes out , they come straight to the boat . it &apos;s fantastic .
i admit that i &apos;m a little nervous here , because i &apos;m going to tell you a couple radical things about how we should think differently about cancer , to a audience that has a lot more people to know about cancer than i do .
so the part of the genome we can read is the list of ingredients .
it &apos;s going to be a huge amount of information in genetics by simply comparing the genetic similarity .
and i said , &quot; okay . at least this guy is good . &quot;
that &apos;s how we measure each of them as a mammal .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some of them .
where do we really have to go , this is the process that &apos;s going on , at the level of <unk> activities on the level of the &apos; why the body doesn &apos;t heal itself , how does it normally make it ?
danny hillis : cancer caused by proteomics
they all are members of tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give people out .
because at stage three , most of us are .
that &apos;s their lobby .
there was no plan . there was no subject before anybody ever tried .
in fact , martin luther kings <unk> &apos;s sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and doing nothing . &quot;
and all of a sudden they took the <unk> and tried to figure out , &quot; how do we do the population of africa ? &quot;
so , we <unk> the little piece of plastic up .
these <unk> or <unk> <unk> that were designed to be able to <unk> the taxes for the ground where they were , they were not as a permanent building .
it <unk> the stability and certainty that can offer the lap of a uncle , you compare them with the <unk> building of a <unk> niece in high school .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the most reliable form of <unk> satisfaction .
i can &apos;t really explain it , and he didn &apos;t .
so , stories like these , these are practical aid in a world that yearns after that , to bring compassion , the <unk> images of suffering that we could otherwise otherwise .
he was also a really heavy-duty person .
and the first day , our <unk> <unk> us and taught us our motto we had every day for the rest of the summer to make the <unk> .
that &apos;s one of two or three of their known .
here are some examples .
it turns out we can &apos;t be part of a group without expecting the opinion of the other .
so this is the world we live in today .
and so i &apos;m going to try and learn from my example of my own way .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine that , you know , make a useful image : i was born in a very small village in mexico , unfortunately , very <unk> , and my parents had no higher education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that happens to us today is incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s in simple , <unk> , and <unk> solutions .
now , we &apos;ve got 30 different technologists putting together in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people in the effort to learn what this particular segment of and demands .
and on my <unk> , my father came to me and said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation has to do better than the previous ones .
i know a lot of people who are very clever and saying , &quot; why can i not solve my problem ? &quot;
and i started them together with another family .
don &apos;t you think that we have the responsibility to take care of serious seriously ? &quot;
i still drive four years old ford as well .
but that &apos;s not a good life .
that &apos;s what he &apos;s praying .
if you believe it or not , doesn &apos;t make me any difference .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s it in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a basketball , and that basketball represented your identity , what you &apos;re .
when my kids were little , i went to her room , sat down to her bed and i was watching my kids to sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i &apos;m going to <unk> with three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very significant number .
in a village we then have 100 laptops , each of us with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village has 10,000 books .
right , the famous chinese character for <unk> .
they answer the question : how does it feel to be aware of ?
we &apos;re really learning that really bad lesson .
if you think about it for a moment , how it is to feel right in the right .
and unlike all else , we &apos;re obsessed with trying to figure it out .
and i have to tell you that i thought i was writing this incredibly embarrassing book about a theme that everyone hate , for an audience that would never give it .
now , the effect of that is not only processed <unk> wheat , but mountains of grains .
1986 came out of vietnam to america .
and the answer to that was , &quot; that &apos;s even worse . &quot;
our <unk> sank at a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of the dotcom , our <unk> has tripled .
and bhutan , for those who don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually that we usually hunt in the west after happiness , as if the happiness is something we have to capture , a thing , or maybe a couple of things we have to get .
and we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we have to really have to do as leaders is we can impact the production of production by creating the right conditions , allowing our employees to live their lives .
bl : okay . one , two , three .
in deck , you &apos;re going to tell you the <unk> , you &apos;re moving , but the eyes moves in unison with the boat and saying , &quot; i &apos;m silent . &quot;
amy , are you going to go up ?
the method that you did ? the result : what did you see ?
i just read one .
real scientific education should give people a voice and give them a voice to express these also , so amy the last word in this short history .
poor people have no choice of choice .
we got into the &apos; 70s .
and to put it in there , we have to recognize that the principle of a <unk> doesn &apos;t just have the kinds of ways we talked about , but also our society .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it &apos;s possible .
i &apos;m sure one of them has already asked me , &quot; yes , great things up there -- but how do i get up there ?
i was a professor at the <unk> davis <unk> , and received a lot of attention , that allowed me to fund the launch of the program .
we have eight motors in this vehicle .
thank you .
they fall apart , they spit and they end here .
i mean , people ask me if mobile phones are safe .
you have an coil .
because , you remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> mobile phone his wife .
and for those who can &apos;t read it : &quot; it seems like this , as if it &apos;s actually a kind of evolutionary technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , where not <unk> , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> poisons in our bodies .
first , a <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , the &quot; <unk> death <unk> . &quot;
it was months later , i learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; keep him alive if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we &apos;ve redefined the hope over again .
it &apos;s a feature .
so , he suddenly knows he &apos;s been defeated .
and to give you this , we need to put them back on the board .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people out , we <unk> the buildings from inside , the <unk> . we helped the first <unk> , for the quest and the rescue .
if i do that , i don &apos;t know the original details , in the contrary , i could write here .
you &apos;re going to allow the public opinion .
it &apos;s not very good .
and that &apos;s a democracy .
so this is the question : which country was going to take better , china or india ?
because the indian man has a benefit of two years from the indian woman .
what political change is in terms of politics .
china , i think , has been a couple more amazing , <unk> problems -- particularly in terms of social capital , public health , a sense of equality that doesn &apos;t exist in india .
it was a place where people with 20,000-dollar stereos and the different <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now you have the problem that you have spent all the money to afford the help with this progressive electronics in these countries , and now it &apos;s all <unk> .
now , a slightly chaotic environment , where people are actually created new , interesting , <unk> controversies -- people are different .
about one or two decades ago , a wonderful <unk> called howard <unk> , and i read darwin &apos;s notebook out of that period .
she <unk> in her colleague , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was going to do it .
does it also be the same ?
in the 1970s , the one percent of the national income in the united states is in the united states .
many of these political factors can be roughly summarized in the category of crony political , political leaders that help create a group of good ones , but actually nothing good for the rest of us .
as you can see , as you can see , how globalization and technology revolution make this global discourse of the money , it &apos;s much more difficult to evaluate the whole thing .
that &apos;s why they invest in unprecedented amounts of time and resources to train their children .
we created the modern <unk> .
that &apos;s his little hand .
one of them will die in one of them .
that was a huge frustration for us , because we believed in a new development .
i believe that in places like oregon , where you need to be <unk> in desire and can &apos;t swallow a toxic dose , only half percent people have ever done it .
so , for a long time , a long time make sense , they came to canada .
but i also heard of cancer as the most <unk> disease of our time , how did the good and the bad together ?
so , some papers went to say that <unk> resistant is about cancer , and beyond that , not only cancer , but against that metastases <unk> into skeletal muscle .
ten percent ! because there &apos;s these <unk> tumors in skeletal muscle , but only 16 percent of the actual metastases -- which <unk> that skeletal muscle might be able to control angiogenesis , to control the angiogenesis , to control those blood vessels .
that &apos;s a very <unk> idea , but i really think that &apos;s possible .
and then my translator left me .
she was the girl sitting in the breaks the other for her team .
and on that , i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia , who had a 11 year-old son .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot;
so , the two came to lunch , and we were thrown out of the restaurant .
he had kids from very early korea , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time talking about the dictionary .
so , i open up the window , look out , and see how flames from the side of the mud go to the sea floor . the hotel is burning .
so we went to the bathroom , took towels and thought about our faces and the children .
by the time , it &apos;s a year . what does it take for that long ?
that &apos;s their <unk> .
that &apos;s sydney that &apos;s going to be three years old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there &apos;s big planets , ok .
but there &apos;s really much more to do .
so the question is , is this chemical phenomenon ubiquitous , or is it something that depends on the planet ?
and that deeper <unk> , which is the main point that the science is , how we know it , how we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to here .
thank you very much .
you see , while uganda <unk> and zimbabwe <unk> , russia on one percent .
you find the highest hiv incarceration in the world in african countries , and yet , you find in senegal , down here , the same rate as in the united states .
now look at this kenya .
it might be something else , which is that the transmission is more common .
we know that roughly <unk> billion people have ever lived .
that was not only an economic story .
and the result is even bigger divergence in a shorter period than it was in germany .
likewise , it &apos;s about institutions .
they have to give me to food . &quot;
he was wrong .
now , i want to end with three questions on the future billion , just before 2016 , when the united states is losing their place as a number of economy .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to get the vast amount of mass that we &apos;ve been compiling , regardless of the evidence that we have lost our ethic and other parts of our historic .
niall , thank you .
there are many kinds of spider silk .
spider silk is almost entirely composed of protein .
the fibers that can make a single spider are already quite diverse .
and also , <unk> has a lot of potential for its ability to <unk> .
what i want to do is not the <unk> , so it &apos;s also lovely , but it &apos;s on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more pictures . there are more photographers .
this is what sounds like in our ears , but what happens is that 80 percent of the <unk> have spent a lot of value .
the first thing that happens when you have a problem is that the first goal of the institution is changing the institution of the institution .
the inventor doesn &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states who are trying to figure out whether bloggers are journalists or not .
it was created by using their <unk> , the use of many of these tools , even though the intelligence of the world today is the same work for the last week in the last week .
you &apos;ve got <unk> , which is probably the most important part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because <unk> is made of fibers .
it &apos;s all on its place . first stage .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the different steps again , under the <unk> of the possible ties to a deeper level -- my search is about the answer to the question , &quot; what &apos;s that special about bread ? &quot;
this is transformation , two different things .
and if you &apos;re shaped , you go again to prove that you &apos;re alive to prove that you &apos;re alive and character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of self-serving , as we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long to write these scores , and at the time i work on a piece , which is 180 pages long , and that &apos;s a big part of my life , and i got the hair .
it &apos;s going to be by brian <unk> <unk> , which is an extraordinary artist .
that gives you a little <unk> of the piece .
what we did -- betty <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two bowls of food : a bowl of <unk> broccoli , and a bowl with <unk> broccoli .
i mean , ultimately , when we look at babies , they seem to be quite useless .
and our babies and children are much longer depending on us than the babies of each other species .
the <unk> brings them to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about it .
boy : that &apos;s why .
our consciousness is going to be extremely bright and vivid , and everything else will be dark .
&quot; babies and little kids are like the research and <unk> of the human genus , &quot; the <unk> immensely <unk> . their research examined how babies could detect information and make choices .
if i give you a quick demonstration for a second , to show the difference -- because it &apos;s really kind of trivial .
then you repeated that process and over and over again , until something like this -- in this case , the character , as i walk , are running straight .
what we really wanted was the entire human body .
you can &apos;t do it yet .
here are a few simple scenes of how it &apos;s going to be .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we did it anyway .
some of the projects already use our software to do that , and we &apos;re going to see a few of our <unk> in a couple of big <unk> .
we thought he would just hold balance .
this is learning to go to the <unk> -- like most of you will know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i believe that art and creativity are absolutely crucial to developing empathy .
if you &apos;re ever lonely , you write a new york times , you get hundreds of emails , and most of what &apos;s going to be achieved to me today about frustration .
but some stories are just <unk> , but it &apos;s so understandable .
it <unk> . nobody ever bought it .
there &apos;s a limit that we don &apos;t want to cross . what &apos;s the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new , ancient document in word -- that might bang !
but i think there are actually two <unk> .
the other products were funded by microsoft with an open standard , rather than apple <unk> standards .
and <unk> , if somebody write me a <unk> -- what &apos;s going to happen every day -- i said , &quot; screw it . &quot;
but when i looked at the <unk> technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and others in the emerging economies of digital technology , i was very worried about the <unk> .
and to put the risks of these new things , we have to have the capacity to the individuals that gives you the access to <unk> .
i think the challenge we face -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is , are we going to develop these <unk> with the background that &apos;s going to take us from this device ?
and if you build a three-dimensional structure , for instance , you have all sorts of incredible properties .
and to give you a sense of the last of small negative links , it &apos;s about 400 million dollars , which is quite considerable for us .
and if you look at the concept of organic meats , you can see a much more participatory infection -- the distinction of market -- to provide feedback loops .
so 12 years ago , caves started to have caves on caves , and i got my research in that direction .
so , simple and grim things .
there &apos;s ice below the surface .
so , you &apos;re a <unk> form of life .
it &apos;s even as much energy for biology in this cave , that there &apos;s actually a large number of neurons in this cave .
we can see them .
we realized that caves have many traits that have been used by the people and other organisms as habitat .
increasingly , when you get a goal , you have to be able to have certain steps to its effects , certain kinds of risk of going on .
and so it &apos;s also true of archimedes , the great greek mathematician .
airs were painted about it , and it was suffering from <unk> .
that means that before we start to digitize the <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the time , the electrons fly around , they emit it .
this was a bad idea because <unk> of macedonia had a son named alexander of the great , and she lost the battle of <unk> .
because at the moment , the institutions are raising their data with <unk> and more .
the original <unk> of the bottle was one of the most <unk> <unk> of the 18th century .
so i asked myself , 160 dollars for that ?
she has four cds .
a <unk> scheme is that many of these things come from japan -- they &apos;ll notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was a object that i couldn &apos;t get into your finger , and that was the <unk> cheval blanc .
and i can &apos;t -- call my taste of a <unk> -- so it &apos;s not really important that i was not impressed , but i was not the only there , with that reaction .
in the beginning of this year , an virtual asteroid sold that for <unk> dollars .
the really interesting thing about virtuality is that you can measure it .
now , i could design a game called <unk> , just by taking a million cake , or a thousand cake .
if there are real boxes , we can &apos;t do much , but in a game we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and virtuality of it .
and i &apos;d like to tell you a short story , so 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how current engagement can be transformed by the psychological and neurological insights that we preserve when we &apos;re watching people playing games .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is officially <unk> .
i &apos;m ellen , and i &apos;m totally obsessed with diet .
it &apos;s definitely hungry in america , 49 million people and almost 1.9 million children .
and their farms are also big .
it &apos;s the eleventh anniversary of <unk> corn and the big <unk> , from chicken <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in america and the change in how we are farming international views .
this is a <unk> that i received two years ago , and this was at one of the biggest projects that i had ever been involved in .
but i &apos;m going to conclude at the beginning of the process , at three very stately statements .
if we are so good at what we do , we should not be able to create an architectural manifestation that goes through the <unk> and <unk> bottlenecks ?
the architectural manifestation was <unk> , <unk> said , simple .
and this is the actual path of effort .
the second technology we use , we use things that you know about the <unk> of an opera .
this is the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk to you today about how you learn stories , in some way .
one of these projects is about a year and a half .
these are the pictures that automatically are created .
as long as i was awake , i had the camera around the neck .
you can see a timeline that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . you know , on .
geert chatrou : a <unk> <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if , after only one year , after one year , what would you do about the next 35 years of your life ?
&quot; money make a store and open a business &quot; was the indian <unk> .
during the day , he told them that he wanted to be here , and he had given me a about <unk> .
i don &apos;t get me wrong , i think , has no benefits .
with the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if lol that means that .
you can &apos;t do that .
when someone was seen from 1973 to a black soldier in 1993 , the <unk> would have been a little different from &quot; love &quot; , but he knew what was going on .
i &apos;m on the <unk> , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can look at my work next week next week , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
it &apos;s not an existential threat to the global security problem .
and the same is true of the troops .
instead , there was a <unk> of <unk> optimism .
diplomats <unk> in <unk> .
and then finally , we have to understand that the mystery of what we &apos;re doing in bosnia and kosovo , the secret to our success part of our success , in the very careful <unk> form of our loved ones . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
rory libya , they &apos;re happy libya to the end .
so here &apos;s two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to show you what it looks like .
there &apos;s also <unk> that are going to be <unk> , but if you look at these <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re used to be used for a different kind of <unk> .
the <unk> . this is a difficult problem of reasons that i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another thing here , very interesting link , and that &apos;s what you want to do , is that you want to be able to lead to that , if you &apos;re going to be a little bit of a general .
so , i think it &apos;s got the minimal foods that we might probably achieve to make things .
and we decided that we should be thinking about this as a result of the cost of the cost , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book called , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> of your kansas ? &quot;
so we have to ask ourselves .
but nevertheless , you don &apos;t use a lot of people who are not as you are .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m joking , but only half , if i tell you that in the hospital , nobody will believe in the hospital if you go to a missing <unk> , without any <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
then bell concludes himself to his students .
within a few years , in late 19th and early 20th century , suddenly the doctor was trying to make a diagnosis , the <unk> .
within the perception of the patient , and the physicians in terms of the best medical care is a real contradiction .
another experience i took in texas , before i went to stanford , i was influenced myself .
the bad news is , we don &apos;t know . see ? you can do that , we can do that . &quot;
i remember so many of the big , crumbling , pure eyes , which led to me on this ritual .
some call us <unk> , a more <unk> term .
in this case , we &apos;ve been able to do that .
for you , here we go , &quot; then a miracle ! &quot;
and there was no way to <unk> .
religious <unk> .
more is to move the dead to an answer .
my friend simon singh , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , wrote the book &quot; the big bang &quot; etc .
and now they open your eyes .
you can completely open it , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but i thought to think that these guys , at least most , know what they do for a living .
they thought that was impossible .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that people want to do .
you don &apos;t need any .
<unk> <unk> has not invented the <unk> <unk> and middle class in venezuela . he only led her .
and that &apos;s how it continues .
they connect people .
the reason why modern medicine is used for a 60 years .
there &apos;s a catch there .
it &apos;s going to make him <unk> , over 5,000 times cheaper , and 400 times more than our entire <unk> of pancreatic cancer .
but my experiences with the world &apos;s world are very different .
it &apos;s like the character is noora .
and why is it teaching sex to babies , and why is the babies in relationships a erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the mystery of the sentences .
especially important about this description of the other , or my self -- that &apos;s the same -- particularly interesting is that there &apos;s no <unk> in the desire .
that &apos;s her <unk> and <unk> , which is biology , the natural instinct .
it &apos;s then starting to demand that . this is the study of curiosity , <unk> .
you know there &apos;s a erotic space , which is all alone .
other places in the country had similar spaces .
in a four-month cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
okay .
it &apos;s played in smaller rooms .
so , early detection , some locations have <unk> .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , this kind of adaptation that we practice ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me and said , &quot; that &apos;s on me !
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to bring here to language ?
einstein einstein -- i was working with somebody when i was in princeton , and i met mr. einstein .
what &apos;s in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a speech or a lecture or a lecture .
and there were about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
a french historian said two centuries later , &quot; rare has a very powerful mind with so great humility of jesus christ . &quot;
or he was what he proposed .
i &apos;m not going to mourn the <unk> about the <unk> .
but for that , you have to sit down about 10 minutes and take a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i was never pure .
harvest <unk> , <unk> .
with tears in the eyes i said , &quot; no . &quot;
2010 : a young woman stood on president <unk> and says , as she and her siblings , her parents died in war .
we go to rural areas and everything we do , as it happens in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i &apos;d like to look at 20 years from now , and see that there &apos;s a girl , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> girl on that ted period .
lg : welcome to happen .
darwin realized , computers can do the necessary <unk> to make insights and choices .
each group is charted by more and more sensors : your phone , your credit , your computer . it &apos;s a lot of data and we get to understand the opportunity to understand our existence .
these are human <unk> .
in a <unk> process , what else is for 40 people about three months , became a simple task for three people in 40 hours . all of these are victories of <unk> .
we should stop looking outside .
i &apos;m going home to dinner with my wife and children &apos;s home .
because people say , &quot; shit man , i don &apos;t have time to be fit .
it became a much larger dog when i thought .
these effects affect us all .
the main buyer of the national geographic <unk> is to our problems .
think about <unk> , <unk> .
in the era after katrina , we have more in common .
and you all have done that , and if you don &apos;t , you &apos;ve got to do it .
help me take green to the new black , help me make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be an opportunity to use scratch to make a interactive map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical of what &apos;s going on .
in this case , you take a <unk> , put it on a stack and stack on <unk> , the behavior of different characters in a game or a story , in this case that &apos;s the big fish .
when you learn to program learning , you can program about learning .
when kids build projects like architectural projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today , to give you a background , is the idea that cars are art .
i want to talk to you .
and i think that the idea that great cars is a soul , very efficient . you all know that . you can see a car with soul on the first sight . you know how strong it is .
this is one of my favorite features that really describes our relationship with cars .
right ? and they decided it would be cheaper , instead of a studio and six or seven apartments , <unk> <unk> <unk> house in malibu .
there was a lot of dialogue .
so , i think we felt very close to each other , we went down to <unk> strings , and we <unk> the concept for the true nature of true <unk> and creativity .
we didn &apos;t bring him to boston .
and i &apos;ve only got a little lab .
now , we &apos;ve been rehearsing clinical trials in four days of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> that can show us this drug on the market .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
what you have to remember is we have to do with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the hundred billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t explained was why the entropy was ever low .
as opposed to the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer to this , we have a good theory that can explain this , and that that the theory of the dark energy is .
and so , even though the universe will forever become forever , and ordinary matter and radiation are going to be <unk> , always a certain amount of radiation , a few thermal fluctuations , even in the empty space .
but we also give large fluctuations .
it turns out .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe you accept and not question .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t accept .
now , i want to say something to all the people there , like me , to the students and the poor people who are fighting with their dreams .
no matter what i was in my real world was only given to my little device in the digital world , eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took that very literally , i took my <unk> , and i put it a little bit of <unk> , which is the projector good <unk> .
the camera doesn &apos;t really understand my motions , but it &apos;s also understanding how things i think of my hand .
and why is it just <unk> ? we can just play with scratch .
all the work you saw is about my learning in india .
this is juan carlos , king of spain .
this is going to be the third park in rio , june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to dig deep underground under the ground to build a stop .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
so every year , we have these horrible <unk> .
we &apos;re going to be under the average in terms of the <unk> in the city .
a city of the future is a city that doesn &apos;t come out of this great community , which is cities .
the best answer lies in it , trying to reconstruct a darwinian <unk> of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so that you can sort of make a kind of attraction , so you can just look at it , just to look at it .
and some of them are too big to use them for the butchering .
our strong response to images , the expression of feelings in art , the beauty of music before the night sky is to us and our offspring as long as the human race exists .
now , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can explain it .
so , you can see here as the computer sees the environment , and since you can &apos;t see the conditions , we can actually see the driver with red leds so that he can really see what &apos;s going on .
let &apos;s see if mark can avoid them .
or for blind people , in everyday , in everyday , in education and office .
a subtle <unk> had begun . the fact that ordinary people don &apos;t hear voices and i heard them , it was that something that was not allowed to agree with me .
my partner <unk> was a catalyst for <unk> , hate and <unk> and sexual <unk> , and i was told by my psychiatrist , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , would be better because cancer is easier to heal than schizophrenia . &quot;
to <unk> <unk> : when social change starts , it can &apos;t be <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
so what i &apos;m arguing is this is where we should look for life , more than mars , even though mars is a much quieter and interesting place .
and the usual astronomers were filled with contempt about it .
because it can live that the kind of life that &apos;s going out there , it has tremendous virtues compared to life on a planet .
there was another object , this high <unk> , with creatures and <unk> and brown -- quite a child &apos;s child .
the first projects were modest , but they would take technology and turning it into things that people could use in a new way , and perhaps find a new functionality .
the other thing that &apos;s going on is that we decided we decided that we decided to put together all the gadgets of gadgets , this whole <unk> , and trying to make it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it a hundred times . so this is another example of all of this in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the development of the brand , it &apos;s all tightly embedded with interconnected . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ;
this is my favorite anthony , in switzerland , he had the laptop for a afternoon , i had to put him again . that was hard .
yves behar : the stories of objects
thank you .
my aunt , an incredibly <unk> and a great woman was lent by early .
she was the <unk> <unk> for women i &apos;ve ever heard of .
tell you those young girls who go back to school after acid into their faces . &quot;
the world that had been given to layma was a world in war .
then you get tense .
they have to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people of my generation living in a world where everything is all <unk> and in some of our best talks on a screen .
in addition , it could mean they could print their own medicine .
and if it makes you fluent , why it &apos;s really interesting , then you have to look at the rest of saudi arabia , because it &apos;s a country that is divided by the dead .
maybe some things are bad traditions , and they need changes .
so let me give you one example : in turkey , where i come from , which is a very ambitious republic , we had recently done something that i call <unk> , which is the universities that should protect the universities , for <unk> . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , if i would be the only person that &apos;s like that , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , as muslims had seen as an example , they were independent , <unk> .
that &apos;s why the e.u. became the e.u. , the efforts of turkey , the european union , within turkey , in turkey , of the pious muslims , as a result of <unk> nations .
there &apos;s a very large nose that doesn &apos;t have the appearance than if you &apos;re connected with anything .
if scientists are today , a century later , it &apos;s going to be visible by the inside , instead of using it .
carl <unk> : glimpses into the interior of our brain
but that trend is less unambiguous .
but for many parts of africa , it took me a colleague of mine , &quot; the <unk> at the ground was covered in the first time , so that the genocide was going to start at the <unk> . &quot;
and instead of putting this opportunity to the local leaders , and international leaders are going to be withdrawn , and since then , from the second <unk> , the events of the fittest . september 2001 and the wars in iraq and iraq .
<unk> design requires a strong focus on the <unk> , <unk> thinking and <unk> and <unk> .
the stromatolites are the heroes of my story .
in flat seas , life has been very early on , and it turned into more complex shapes .
<unk> <unk> over continents . the big story began .
some of the moons of mine went back into the water .
all man should have the opportunity to have a little luxury .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we &apos;ve got <unk> <unk> with prostate cancer , and then we created our motto , which is , &quot; the face of man &apos;s health . &quot;
mo <unk> from canada , from the u.s. , and from england <unk> us and called us , and they said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing here for prostate cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year , we had been fortunate to have 450,000 <unk> . &quot;
this kind of entertainment , men of it , at any age , is so critical and important , and i think that much more important than the money we collect .
he could see what his forest happened , his environment , because his grandfather took him under his <unk> when he was only two years old , and he started teaching him about the forest and the way of life .
when i thought about it , i wonder what our grandchildren and our friends would answer if they ask the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human world .
it works with people like <unk> krishna .
a lifetime , through everything , about the cultural revolution , and everything that came after that , so that it &apos;s about eight million units in his museum today , the contemporary chinese history . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it just happens .
my world is subjective .
or maybe it was only one of the questions that was sitting on a rock , and the sky <unk> , and the sun and the moon .
and if you lived a remarkably life , you &apos;ll be able to get into the <unk> , or , as the french call it : the &quot; <unk> &quot; -- -- the skies of <unk> .
and so it &apos;s coming to this great rituals where large amounts of oil companies are going to be protected for 10 days .
you see , what is business as a result of the behavior of the market and the behavior of an organization ?
you see , that &apos;s india today . the <unk> of reality is based on a <unk> view .
you know , he set up the biggest <unk> , it &apos;s called &quot; big <unk> . &quot;
&quot; why i chose this path why i didn &apos;t care about the surgery , i just want to ask myself . &quot;
<unk> <unk> opens up the eyes for a new look at the myths of india and the west -- and shows why these <unk> systems of the <unk> , the death of death , of death , with death , and the <unk> , are helping us to be <unk> . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but you know what ? it &apos;s nearly 2012 and the world to say , &quot; i &apos;m completely and completely competent , &quot; means that you can <unk> the weakest .
you &apos;re interested in what ?
their friends and family will be <unk> , and there , on your grave , there &apos;s a tombstone on your grave , &quot; here &apos;s a great engineer , the velcro . &quot;
you &apos;re thrilled . this is the conversation that welfare mothers and dads , because your child is good in math and you know what &apos;s coming next .
that &apos;s because they -- they know what they are .
i don &apos;t have patents , and i never got money from a medical school system , and i didn &apos;t tell you that they vote for me .
so how do you know if your breast &apos;s breast density ?
ultrasound has more biopsies to the result that are in relationship to other technologies , and it &apos;s not very prevalent .
when you find a tumor , as long as it happens less than one centimeter , the average likelihood is about 90 percent , but it &apos;s going to be <unk> with increasing <unk> .
the image of mbi shows this tumor much more explicit , just like a second tumor , which is highly correlated to the surgical possibilities of the patient &apos;s disease .
it takes a quarter years of special education to be an expert in this , a normal <unk> detail of a <unk> .
some women die of breast cancer , many years later , and luckily , most of them survive .
dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum da dum dum there , there &apos;s a lot of stuff going on there .
we put those physicists in los angeles to see what they &apos;re building .
<unk> .
they have slept in that <unk> .
that &apos;s a <unk> vision .
it &apos;s a question of consequences .
so let &apos;s go to the point .
what did i do ? i heard on my belly ?
that &apos;s interesting . that &apos;s a different way to think .
the <unk> is basically a visualization of a human race , where each body is proportionate to the surface that it &apos;s in the brain .
that &apos;s white noise .
and db will probably be in your direction .
i did that just to make money .
thank you .
and he told me after a long silence , &quot; i wonder , &quot; i wonder if people here are not your reed , as my video . &quot;
this is the reason i with david edward , a scientist from harvard , a physical object created the toxic elements with these plants .
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , herbs and so on .
the tragedies of other people can be easier than their own , and i want to be able to address the <unk> spirit of that conference .
now , as malcolm gladwell was &#91; the &#93; cocaine was crack the <unk> version of <unk> for the inner city .
he was a really interesting piece of sight .
he went back to the second bar and said , &quot; hey boys .
it &apos;s like mcdonald &apos;s .
now , let &apos;s think about other forms of information , where you can expect a very high risk .
the second reason was that the gang was brilliant in marketing and fraud .
economists talk about game game -- that each game has a <unk> for two persons .
<unk> is skydiving with a board on the feet .
<unk> on as high levels like this is only possible if you take step for step , if you &apos;re really mentally <unk> and mentally work mentally .
ue : no . that &apos;s just smoke .
i make myself meet with scientists .
so i had the hope that by making some natural elements , a little mist , i could make the space .
<unk> means that it makes a difference if you do something or not .
the big mountains in the distance are moving less .
how do we create a notion which is both access to individuality , and also <unk> , without the two of the two different directions in two different directions ?
i was talking about new types of <unk> , one that &apos;s attracted to the animals instead of <unk> them .
but even more radical was the material that <unk> the <unk> .
they &apos;re going to take the dead and take the dead .
at that time , he taught the classic at the <unk> college in <unk> .
natalie merchant sings : old poems of life

it &apos;s not the <unk> . that &apos;s not my side .
and sometimes war is <unk> , but sometimes , with a little bit of effort , we can avoid him .

and we saw this guy , <unk> .
and slowly , you start thinking that sustainable life is less fun than living normal .

what i &apos;d like to talk about , these are the biggest issues in the world .
but it &apos;s a problem , of course , when people are focusing on problems .
so what i &apos;d like to do is to say that we have had a very long time to have a situation where we have had a number of choices .
and then ask why economists ?
but it says that what we can do about it is to very high cost .
the <unk> of malaria are centered on a few million infected each year .
what &apos;s happening here is we think about our priorities .

so , when 50 house found that , although 50 percent of all countries are oppressive today , 70 percent of them are oppressive in terms of the people who don &apos;t have access or <unk> .
because then , after all , the question we have and seven billion other people on this planet is : how can we create wealth ?
the <unk> is not that right to your place .
we &apos;re going to do what really care about .
it was released six months ago , and it &apos;s got incredible attention to germany .
you have to make one of the growth for growth .
i think it looks very easy to human skin , which i &apos;m fascinated with .
but i think it could be a rather <unk> and sustainable supplement to our <unk> lanes .
chinese workers are not born in factories because of our <unk> demand for ipods .
it &apos;s because one person &apos;s time to spend their time doing a piece of something , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s going to be a piece of something .
min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; well , you understand that . you don &apos;t even understand anything . &quot;
this is the <unk> that gave me to her family to her family &apos;s family .
the taliban are running their schools .
if any child is going to show you this rules , it &apos;s going to be hard punished .
when i look at the child &apos;s younger than i , or in my age , i feel so inspired by their <unk> .
and that &apos;s going to be able to wait for enceladus , in enceladus , of <unk> , hopefully sometime in the middle future , specifically equipped to pursue this question .
is the internet actually a place you can go to ?
and the landscape is changing . three years ago , when i started to work with this , there was only one cables along the west coast , represented here in this map of steve song as a thin black line .
and that seems to me not right .
this data will layer layer on the device , starting with the base of the product , and put the material layer on layer down , by putting the new <unk> in a <unk> process on the old layer of the <unk> . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it was created by <unk> by layers of layers of <unk> .
it &apos;s a classic that &apos;s likely to be less likely .
you can just make it straight locally .
this is where the product is made .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology is going to create a revolution in production and the <unk> as we know it .
he was worried that when he called them at this name , especially outside , in public , you might think he would be looking for the jihad .
they use his <unk> .
the good news is that it &apos;s not going to be like that .
but a lot of these factors that played a role , are even more important . half of the labor is done .
i was with my girlfriend , susan <unk> , the <unk> , in the mathare valley of valley .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty wasn &apos;t the bad . it was the indignity , and the embarrassment of the whole thing . &quot;
do you think i &apos;ll miss the violence or the drugs ? do lack of privacy ?
first , instead of months , instead of flying over and forgotten , the time was a lot of vacuuming .
but it &apos;s less likely that they stay .
and during my first year , i kept on my company .
it &apos;s actually going to be said that more energy is needed to make a solar cell system than it &apos;s going to be in its entire dress .
but then they collect light for five and a half hours .
also , they are under great pressure , and that &apos;s why dangerous .
that &apos;s a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a small cylinder down here , which is the generator and all the <unk> in it , and this is the hot <unk> , the hot cylinder &apos;s cylinder -- this piece is hot , and it &apos;s getting electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also sound .
so , here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have access to use this energy as fast as we do at the moment .
we &apos;ll blow it up and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a flying lab with which we put the measurements in the area of this molecule .
but i kept doing bad poems , and he never got the <unk> into the air , but he went to cuba .
so , from <unk> , great things can arise -- -- which i &apos;m going to end up with a picture that &apos;s going to be in my work .
i work for the new yorker and i make <unk> , and then the eleventh september , and that was , um , a <unk> end of the world as we knew it .
and then , &quot; leads you right ! be careful with the tongue , but that we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided that his <unk> had to be extinct . &quot;
this man is angry because somebody on his stairs is distributed , and basically -- you know , there &apos;s a theme here -- you know , you know .
and she &apos;s also <unk> with george <unk> , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s .
td : since my youngest childhood and i got a lot of different vegetables , a lot of different vegetables , and when i was young , it always came to me that my journey was already <unk> .
it &apos;s beautiful , but we should also remind ourselves that a similar process should actually put on the ground .
td : so lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let alone , because of everything else , which is happening , and i &apos;ve been quite beautiful , and i &apos;ve been quite beautiful , and i &apos;ve been very withdrawn for this entire week .
in these two examples , we have seen machines that have learned in the simulation , and others that have learned in reality .
when i say , &quot; we , i mean the advice for <unk> .
but nobody believes it &apos;s actually going to be very effective if there &apos;s a real outbreak .
the biggest part of the spending in the middle of bush is actually more connected with anthrax and the threat of <unk> .
we know that the virus will mutate . it will be a different virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a <unk> debate about what percentage of people &apos;s rights rates among people confers and coughing and how much about the hands .
some of the poorer countries that have the most experience of h5n1 , have a series of drugs that are already alive .
and i think even our leaders would say , in this case , we have very much to do .
i &apos;m pleased to answer your questions .
our centers for <unk> have developed one of them -- as early detection <unk> .
and in the <unk> <unk> , in humans , similar bacterial infections have no problem .
don &apos;t just pay attention to how much fun you have with it , but how the use of it is changing the way it is changing the way it is changing with a city like san francisco &apos;s . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
please join me a <unk> .
i <unk> with a young juggler from a force , and he <unk> to me three clubs .
since my childhood , i play with <unk> and climb , which is the case . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to be a <unk> .
you &apos;re not going to look into the infinite record .
so i &apos;m not supposed to <unk> here , isn &apos;t it ?
i &apos;m sitting in the middle .
she got one , trigger to the triumph .
because of the <unk> petals and the limbs , it &apos;s very dark and very quiet .
i and my colleagues of <unk> are interested in the dynamics of <unk> that live in the forest .
we &apos;re advising us with the media about <unk> ; we have a <unk> ; we have <unk> .
and then the students went into our <unk> , and they took their own <unk> with their own education .
and our new project is that the inmates and we &apos;re learning to grow the frog <unk> <unk> , which is a measure of endangered endangered <unk> in the united states and in the united states .
he said , &quot; let &apos;s see what she hid in front of you . &quot;
so we &apos;re going to see a demand demand for <unk> .
they &apos;re not wizard . they &apos;re not our parents .
you &apos;ve got to believe me . trust me . &quot;
that day i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go under water , the higher pressure is the pressure .
so i started like this about 15 years ago .
and when it comes out , the air goes into the <unk> , when it comes out , when the air comes out of the wheelhouse .
so all of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are surviving , there &apos;s still brain masses .
but this is what it looks like , and this habitat continues , over many miles .
so , sharks are not quite as dangerous as most people are .
when we found it , we weren &apos;t even sure to which family heard it , so we called him <unk> , because he looked like he looked out of one of his books .
the quality of education is a <unk> and it <unk> .
this means that each and every one of you here is at least one child that suffers from a <unk> .
and his communication and social interaction and social interaction has changed so that he could go to a normal school and even a <unk> .
it &apos;s like life : if you &apos;re only once in it , you can &apos;t get back .
i know you &apos;ve never heard of him . but you &apos;ll notice that day , someday you &apos;ll hear about him , because it &apos;s an amazing man . &quot;
nk : no , it died 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love , he loved everybody .
we all , all of us , are what happens when a <unk> of hydrogen and helium is so long enough that they start to questions about their origins .
these <unk> prove that life can exist in many other environments .
so you have to get the diversity and the incredible extent of life on this planet in the first step , but learning to a contact with life elsewhere in all of you .
and it &apos;s going to be silicon as important as aluminum , and we &apos;re going to be able to extend it by using it to 350 screens so it &apos;s sensitive to the moore &apos;s law of biodiversity .
and then we &apos;d like to search for the <unk> search through human rights .
many say it &apos;s the safest place in the world to study the development of climate change .
all cylinder is a breath of time .
while you climb up with the ice , you put a quarter of petrol tags in a oven so you can put a new pair , if your <unk> <unk> and your finger will be .
i think at this point , this is a little bit of <unk> .
and our soldiers are not going to look forward to <unk> in <unk> , when they &apos;re actually <unk> to the service to <unk> american <unk> .
you can keep it even further , and increase efficiency antibodies with several <unk> improvements , and therefore the separation of the large hadron collider double .
we could build bigger cars , which led to safety , but easy to be easily .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we have our <unk> <unk> , and they don &apos;t have the other .
in fact , by raising the <unk> step at the <unk> mass of these kinds of materials , or in this case , to create <unk> <unk> , as a good <unk> ; the <unk> can do that as well as it was the <unk> to the internet .
it can &apos;t easy to make a giant <unk> conspiracy .
there were two types of negative feedback that we received .
let &apos;s hope that it &apos;s really stable .
<unk> , i &apos;m wrong .
in the end , he found a <unk> , a dutch <unk> named the han named king van meegeren who gave him a wonderful vermeer today , which is about 10 million dollars now .
according to his <unk> , he looked as though he first discovered that there &apos;s bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s on it . what &apos;s it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive you can find them , how much you &apos;re going to be sexually inspired or fluidly , depends on what you think you think you &apos;re looking at .
but each one of these three objects has a value beyond what it is , because of its history .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even though i can &apos;t tell the difference .
so he took joshua bell to take his body bag into a subway station in washington d.c. , and see how much money he &apos;s going to take .
the second shock hurts is less because you &apos;ve got a little bit of it .
and if you look at it , you can see that there might be some kind of political <unk> .
it <unk> that she &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> member of the american midwest of <unk> , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who eat vegetables and olive oil , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most intriguing things in the entire world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> conclusion , if you allow a drug in such high doses , that there &apos;s more side side side effects , and that your new drug is going to look better .
the big trials are closer to the true answer .
that &apos;s a problem for which there &apos;s no solution for that .
and very soon , they would have started that charcoal , 2,000 after 9 / 11 , <unk> around <unk> , <unk> to china and all over the world .
can you imagine how you might feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s only about oil ; you know that , all knowledge .
there &apos;s this thing , the <unk> of the world , and that &apos;s directly from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they &apos;re christians .
man who americans are kind of like this , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
you generalize . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all others are chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of them on the morning down to his child , and it &apos;s got it and said , &quot; honey , i &apos;m back .
it has changed .
and all that has had huge implications in the world .
i think thomas jefferson really did this very well in words .
for the <unk> in the audience , you can even explain why <unk> have a bigger budget , and that &apos;s because <unk> easier to translate into other languages and cultures . so the market for those movies is bigger .
but it &apos;s going to happen within this century .
that &apos;s not the <unk> of the united states , which is about a million , but the gdp of the world per capita -- 200,000 dollars .
and also , as everyone knows here -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the climax of a life-long commitment that started with the label at the <unk> <unk> on the <unk> .
a lot of our actions on this planet is affecting the living environment , only by faith and mating .
each one has been for thousands or millions of years .
we need to calm down until we ruin the planet .
e.o. wilson : the bailout of life on earth on earth
another <unk> is the famous european aurochs .
the wave of the passenger pigeon has got 1.3 billion base pairs .
the de-extinction of de-extinction falls into this group .
<unk> <unk> from light <unk> chicken .
now , there &apos;s a program on the <unk> , which is just brilliant .
this is an emotional subject . some people got up .
my grandmother was a stay-at-home picture .
i also did my own comics , which was another way of telling stories , by words and through images .
and we sat just like this , in silence and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really talented . &quot;
heroism your own style . draw not how you tell you .
&quot; more jarrett , i &apos;ve got your <unk> .
i &apos;m also going to publish a book with the title , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> : the <unk> call <unk> . &quot;
sound affects us all constantly , psychological , cognitively and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds , <unk> <unk> , which was built recently in england , designed by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not only kids who are affected .
people who say , let &apos;s not sit next to this team , because the noise like that , and the other one needs to be .
&quot; upwake &quot; tells a story about zero , a contemporary business plan who wears his life in a suitcase , and that is between dream and reality and reality .
<unk> <unk> and four and a half years later , what was starting to be as a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> talented actors .
i know that theater connects us .
now , the time we can use the diversity of our talents to create an intelligent and extraordinary work , and <unk> .
when you look in the bathroom , you &apos;ll see some products like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also toothpaste .
<unk> collagen -- or , since the &apos; 70s , from pigs -- is used to inject it into fold .
so i &apos;ve found 185 products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve got a long and a half year before you . &quot;
i said to them , you should be wondering , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they gave me the feeling of being somebody , in a period where i felt like no one .
they &apos;re working on the ninth issue , so they started <unk> and now reached the edge of the alphabet .
and hundreds of verbs can behave that way .
you can see that as the language of thought , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so , the puzzle is , why are we going to do , polite requests , <unk> and <unk> are going to be so often saved ?
you can try to imagine what if speech could only be used to be used .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have trouble .
here &apos;s my argument . isn &apos;t it ? is it good ?
that &apos;s what it does . it &apos;s <unk> .
what are they going to get to convince me from that ?
all of these different roles . can you imagine a argument where you &apos;re going to participate in , but in the audience , you can see on the cutting edge ?
or -- and that &apos;s the most interesting part for me : we want them to go into the world of nature . we bring a <unk> and find the masters of adaptation in nature that might inspire us .
it changed everything . from there , these engineers weren &apos;t going to go into the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we make things .
this is the <unk> national lab .
that would be <unk> for fuel cells , if you could be able to be able to do without <unk> .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a subset of the elements in the <unk> .
and respond and respond : feedback is very important .
you can &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i started under the taliban .
in south korea and indonesia are almost half a million companies .
because , like , you know , from the <unk> , smaller <unk> , in direct context is <unk> economic <unk> .
and that in all the world are not exceptions .
people are <unk> by this <unk> and this miracle .
i have a <unk> <unk> of joyous , himself <unk> cows on my <unk> , and i &apos;d like to use photoshop to <unk> it .
first of all , we were flying it .
what does that mean ?
when i started to work with them , i realized they &apos;ve adapted incredibly well .
but the researchers had a problem .
until finally , they took their <unk> and they were going to go to campus -- and surely , there was a little bit of time to come back , and they &apos;d come back and find that crows are still going to be reminded them .
we found that they &apos;re really smart and they can teach each other .
so , for instance , they would go looking for the peanut and go again .
but there were three problems , three mysteries i could not solve , and i want to talk about that , but more importantly , i found a <unk> .
who would ever offer me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen because every region has something to offer .
let me make the connections .
you know , there &apos;s the <unk> of the future there . you have to understand that .
that &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
oh , i &apos;m going to be the johnny depp &apos;s going to be the sound .
it &apos;s about 10 million prescriptions .
and over here , we &apos;re seeing , with the words of the radiologists israel <unk> , &quot; like the hand , the penis in a way that &apos;s reminded by <unk> . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i would rather stop if you don &apos;t have anything about it . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should make an experiment .
he had a line in his book , which was <unk> from the <unk> , and there was a <unk> maria <unk> , who had trouble with conception .
so now you have a evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i &apos;ve got to read them what she said , because i find it so beautiful .
i think that &apos;s very unfortunate . not because i want to use him . i wanted to see him . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our history .
now , i would have thought to that moment at the age of 50 , one of the skills that i had really had , to bind my shoes .
first of all , i need to tell you that i &apos;m not here from here .
yes . the artist doesn &apos;t seem to know where he should <unk> the different colors .
but i can see in their faces that they &apos;re still slightly skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; and i think that &apos;s appropriate .
after awhile , i decided to have a little fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i got a few things in the room .
and now they &apos;re all in there .
so my father was one of my youth , so my youth was very interesting .
that song as a mere fact .
when i was , &quot; moment , is it good , i &apos;ll put the wheels on . &quot; from a gold protest , i bought the flashy wheels , and i set them up and -- look at it -- look , i could have my <unk> ?
it just sounds , but i think we &apos;re generally dealing with our society and culture with the <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> itself , and he was really proud of it .
human beings , i love that thing .
the consequences of a planet that has already lived seven billion people .
and in particular , he was very proud of his own <unk> , which is very <unk> , which he &apos;d had his <unk> , and the beautiful <unk> around the seat around the seat .
intent -- life is living with intent -- in terms of life , the original slightly better <unk> .
i saw the living mass of a left , and i realized that it was lost , <unk> all the time that i didn &apos;t have done yet , but it was possible .
and then , as many times as many times , i started asking how my life would have been different if this man didn &apos;t hurt me if my genes would have had a different kind of experience of experience .
i was , but i was now in spite of a <unk> myself , and that , so i suspect , was now to me .
i &apos;d been hoping for something much simpler : this <unk> <unk> against four words and making me back to my way .
he spent six months in prison , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine <unk> laboratory at the university of california , san diego combined .
one , the perception of people . and secondly , a natural interface , a natural form of interaction , so that interaction with the robot is going to be intuitive .
and yet , i took this idea .
after i recognized this economic danger , i thought , we have to find a solution for this problem .
so , some of you , in fact , have been looking at the speaker to talk to nathan <unk> , or the one of tim &apos;s delight that might be as seen as to be seen .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that involves that .
this time i paid 25 cents , because i thought the task was a bit difficult .
and yet , there was one , which was all secure : the expansion had to slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back of the mind , because i &apos;m going to call you three <unk> to string theory .
the <unk> went down to about 10 to 500 .
and he was working for decades to explain that number , but he didn &apos;t succeed , and we know why .
each of these universes has extra dimensions .
because the astronomers of today by taking powerful telescopes to the sky , a handful of <unk> photons -- a sort of <unk> <unk> , billions of years .
now , i want to be honest with them and tell them that most of it is only one trick , but a trick that actually works .
remember , it &apos;s the first time you &apos;re hitting it . we want to do it , but we really want to make it more and more curious .
he said , &quot; go , milo . <unk> them . &quot;
pm : so that &apos;s the right thing in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know anybody here .
in the next moment , the phone is not going to be more , the tv , of the day , the men &apos;s on the street , and they &apos;re <unk> .
it was a very grim meeting of the reporter who worked on war , the employees of aid , and of course , the brave , indigenous people of sarajevo .
when i ask , why i &apos;m going to go on , why i &apos;m going to stay on this , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my profession that <unk> , and this is the <unk> , the nub of the thing to us .
even before a goal , she &apos;s trying to find out with the joystick of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , trying to find the goal no matter where it is .
in fact , we <unk> the animals so they learn to control these <unk> and to explore objects in the virtual world .
in an experiment we did a few years ago , we went to the limit .
so we start to china .
so dai manju was finished .
please raise your hand .
the last reason it has to do with it is that women are part of the solution , not the problem .
in niger , one of the seven women at birth is a child .
it became part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he <unk> the world bank , once said , &quot; it can be good that investment in the developing world of girls in the developing world . &quot;
that &apos;s bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the feather of a bird .
this whole vertebrae by a single of our <unk> tells us that there &apos;s a <unk> .
and even this picture makes the suspect impression of being <unk> -- like something from the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> circus .
one of these possibility was that we could have upgraded <unk> .
they put their arrowheads up and say , &quot; i want to trade these home against 26 arrows . we share 50 to 50 .
there are places on this island where you can make all three or four kilometers to a new language .
when 27 individuals from these 27 vessels go to a table putting their 23 languages , then they tell you that they &apos;re going to need an army of <unk> <unk> to be prepared for all the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they &apos;re also concerned about language .
and what i &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and a bit , and how the image is changing through the text , and the text through the image .
this is <unk> <unk> , walking across the bottom of the atlantic ocean and north america with europe .
they turn the negative around .
but through the impression of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> sat down eight years of <unk> <unk> , in arizona , for kidnapping , for the kidnapping and <unk> <unk> of a <unk> boy on a two-wheeler . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp;
in addition , people are left themselves .
and they got to texas for us here to texas .
and now you go with the <unk> where you are in that moment .
it &apos;s just the vastness of the sky that makes it look like this as a result .
this is what you call <unk> after a sense : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
part of that is the legacy <unk> , the <unk> , which is the pursuit of happiness for happiness , it &apos;s going to be from <unk> aspects of the individual driven and can &apos;t be found in reality .
one of the most interesting things about the science of happiness is that happiness and education is not <unk> in a closed-loop continuum .
it begins in <unk> .
here &apos;s a three weeks old baby .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only one possibility of status , which is dominance .
i want to close with a few quotes .
why should you vote rats ?
once the rat did that , we do a little bit of a job .
in fact , you can actually heal , even in people who are hiv-positive .
so with knowing that a patient , the brain , to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- 15 healthy people , you can be secure that we have already saved a lot of lives .
this is neurons .
so that &apos;s important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is : if i just looked at how one person would touch , why am i not confused and literally <unk> this <unk> from the <unk> , how someone &apos;s going to be touched ?
thank you . i have two missions here today .
i don &apos;t really care about the <unk> , but it &apos;s about the pollen itself .
all these pictures were taken through a <unk> by the fact of kew <unk> in the lab of kew .
even every single one of us has a story to tell the <unk> .
we need to be as good as the breast cancer is to address this crisis .
at the time , in the 1980s , when we were women and death through heart disease , they were looking at a <unk> for the new england journal of medicine and called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at that . &quot;
as opposed to <unk> , x-ray , <unk> , for women , whose family &apos;s looking at the heart of the heart , each time we light up something that &apos;s just a little bit of a lot of radiation , we ask , &quot; is that test really ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they have done what they said , they &apos;ve kept <unk> , and they &apos;ve got national debt .
the cells have something like <unk> ; in the dish , they don &apos;t feel at home .
what does that mean for us ?
over the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours , about a <unk> hours of <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first acquisitions that happened before a little bit more than a year ago .
and to conclude , my son is alone in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project philip <unk> , rony <unk> and <unk> roy are here to see here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son took more than two steps before -- trapped in the movie .
and that &apos;s an important question for success , because the better we understand how the brain determines , the better we can communicate . i think also , the better we can think of and work together .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture and think , &quot; oh ! i have a strong or emotional response to that . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is to paint our teams of <unk> the entire wall onto a large wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not just about hygiene , but it &apos;s also about the possibility of relaxation .
so don &apos;t build it .
when you translated it into the building , if you have a <unk> and a window , we &apos;re going to say , &quot; oh no , that &apos;s broken , that &apos;s going to be repaired . &quot;
that &apos;s the difference .
so we continued to put ourselves on .
are we just stupid ?
you might be looking at it in two years when you read eight hours a day .
so you can <unk> in september <unk> and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police waits the <unk> of fire to cut the vehicle in pieces , to cut the body of the driver &apos;s body .
and that is enough to the present with the <unk> in the united states , which is a eye of divinity .
all that leads us -- <unk> , just to give you this : what we &apos;re doing most of them is to use digital devices .
this is the consequence of destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right by the stroke .
this is a very , very diverse level to get out of the healthcare system .
he then gave my jaw in the right position as he <unk> my teeth .
alfred mann is a brilliant physicist and neuroscience , who &apos;s fascinated with the consciousness , whether he tells you the ear of ears , or a blind person , or a <unk> of the movement .
now , i had to be in the dark ages , which followed me to what was going to be like when anything that was happening today .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : so if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing world : they had large families and a relatively short life .
and these are here on this side . a large <unk> of africa and the ones .
and then deng xiaoping came to china and brought money to china and bring it back to the country .
now , a search engine that we can copy the data into a broken format and worldwide , and what do we hear when we look at it ?
but that &apos;s making hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained life after it &apos;s got done , but what was the essence of life ?
and that &apos;s where i learned a francis crick .
but there were , however , in literature .
we weren &apos;t the best chemist in the room .
i was unhappy ; my girl didn &apos;t feel me .
so you can compare dna as the dna of light and oily segments .
and so i close by that , by telling you , we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
in this case , the defense costs , in such a case , two million dollars and takes 18 months when you win .
first , fighting not fighting the patent against the patent , but against the <unk> .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to leave you with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; they asked girls .
the fathers were in a place where they were moving their daughters to play , their chairs <unk> and put their hand into the dance .
that &apos;s a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much left in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in people .
the enemy doesn &apos;t see most of the time , and naturally , we needed a different approach to eradicate polio than we did with smallpox .
it has helped to control pandemic <unk> , sars , for example .
the reality of polio today is something quite different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most difficult places ?
bruce <unk> : how to make polio dictator
dj : we found these <unk> now in all sorts of animals , especially with the major ones .
and in our surprise , it was a <unk> .
for us , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope that &apos;s accompanied us in our work .
it was incredibly amazing than they took it in safety to protect it from the hyena .
and of course , if i look at these <unk> , which is <unk> , it &apos;s reminded me a human hand , and that &apos;s ironic because your destiny is in our hand .
we need it . we respect each other as a man and woman as a community and as part of this planet , and we need to continue with that .
it seems to be obvious that the earth is big and unknowable , the sun is small and <unk> . but it &apos;s worth remembering what &apos;s going to be wrong with .
and that &apos;s because , in middle world , there &apos;s always been there .
the nature of this model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because there &apos;s no consensus in their assigned , <unk> , the <unk> , as we see him in middle world , just as we see him in middle world .
now , as machines like machines like this , scientifically and <unk> are exactly right , but it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> if you want to guess what &apos;s going to do next .
so , at night , i was born to the <unk> <unk> at 40 years old age .
on a cursor that i &apos;m controlling with my head , i allow these <unk> to see videos from the robot and sending commands by putting together into a <unk> <unk> .
with the help of people like you , we can make that dream .
in the oceanography , for example , a <unk> principle is the <unk> , by looking at the <unk> , which splits the dolphins , visualizing .
i think together , we can form a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
there are some lessons there are some lessons you can learn from that .
but usually we don &apos;t do that .
i think we &apos;re trying to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is at 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
i also suspect most of you don &apos;t speak chinese -- which is really sad when you think that this is the most common language on the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that too .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should i be interested in that ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow you to look outwards and find the world and find its place in it .
they would bring wealth and safety , religious violence , make sure that states never <unk> terrorists .
and part of this activity is honesty .
what is that ?
i love this court .
and the war layer , the 20 million people taken life -- until today the <unk> civil war in the world .
<unk> sen , who &apos;s this guy , &quot; i &apos;d also earned all this money , but i spent all this time looking for the american man who had stolen my prescription .
chinese restaurants have done the same thing , i would argue , with the <unk> and the <unk> -- even the restaurant -- but without a centralized headquarters .
in contrast , we have general tso chicken that started in new york city in the early 1970s , when i was in new york city in the early 1970s , so ...
so what we &apos;re seeing in the 17th century century is the <unk> search for medicine that creates the same thing .
so people would have a really big seizure .
when the sailors started to become less , i was always <unk> , until i thought , my god , i can &apos;t work anymore .
do you remember being a child on any line ?
at 18 and 19 , i was at the night .
once again , i &apos;ll give a little depressed and some strength .
many of us realize that there &apos;s a lot to do in the next few years with a better world .
he goes , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know , where did the treatment of the world &apos;s treatment have been combined with the potential of the world &apos;s potential and climate change ?
when you climb up the impossible , you can do it .
but we &apos;ve got a deal with climate change .
and there was crying god .
the <unk> makes something remarkable : they use two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their spinneret to create a material that &apos;s really hard to do , comparable with technical fibers like kevlar .
or you can see beautiful things like this , if the camera can capture that .
here you see it &apos;s taken from the tissue .
with my new project , marilyn <unk> , i &apos;d like to use art for making technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone that <unk> the body , and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- hopefully , to help him to make some of his closest decisions . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
what should i do ? &quot;
in fact , in the frame of these two days , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is far more than <unk> <unk> -- he collects the feedback of his fellow and the <unk> of his fellow , the answer to the crowd . works this thing ?
stanley mcchrystal , inventor of the famous memorandum of <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> into the <unk> and <unk> , that there &apos;s two people to be a link over only five to seven steps .
how does our view change about relations as a result of <unk> groups ?
but there was a <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you that i &apos;m going to tell you that , and where you could have put that bald in the ear .
oh ... my father , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided they needed false papers .
this sense of view of people &apos;s life is despite his young age of 17 years , and his fault to be a <unk> , because he was running out of a camp , while his friends were closed , they maintained his entire life .
and while my <unk> and my <unk> were used to think , kind of <unk> , my father had false papers .
i asked him , in the victims of the victims that he had , if he had ever regretted it .
we grow from a few million people on the seven billion people we are today , and we are .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a <unk> <unk> at 17,500 levels , which is a <unk> after the next <unk> , which is seemingly in a good state .
when you go to the forests , the border of the sand cliffs , you have the ability to stay stable , to stay stable .
with the observations of <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> great barrier reef and scientists , that the great barrier reef is <unk> .
but the drama is , of course , that <unk> change is not an option .
that brings me to another reason why i &apos;m here today : because i really like media with media .
this is a <unk> of a race from a wide developed <unk> .
first of all , he takes a ancient way of manufacturing , which is <unk> and connected with a three-dimensional perspective , which is a whole new technique at that time .
and through the process of sugar of sugar , i got portraits of them .
it became very large images , and i took them with a very large camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest in <unk> , especially in bad <unk> , is very far .
there &apos;s a sequence that &apos;s in the back of the chimpanzees as well .
so we can then ask : is there any difference between 17 and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it with the genome of today .
we can then ask for the kids , as regards neanderthals : have you been listening to the people today ?
there are many people who designed their own vision , like this vision from the beginning of the 20th century .
in my belief , the state of the future has his own consciousness .
imagine being able to grow in the 3d printer , and they &apos;re embedded in the 3d printer , and they follow the forces that are occurring in their components .
they didn &apos;t speak . but most of all , they were extraordinary isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would be <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
you feel that the research that you have has been doing , you really have a effect on reality , that you can actually prevent these experiences that i started my way in that area .
you add off .
<unk> <unk> you in a rigid place -- chin on the <unk> , arms <unk> across your <unk> .
they did all the same as we were taught them .
and after the battle , they put that mobile phone and they do what you call &quot; <unk> &quot; to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
people have changed .
i said , &quot; where &apos;s he now ? &quot;
that &apos;s not a <unk> .
and she showed up on the left work to tell me how difficult this image was , which was , for you , with the idea of how black represented .
it &apos;s really in this sense of <unk> that i have a new series of questions that i place .
now , that &apos;s kind of an obvious statement .
and the kids said , &quot; how do we do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to pay numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long did you get through it before you decided that you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
your <unk> increases down to 50 , which is what you &apos;re looking at in the other schools in new delhi , with a biotechnology biotechnology teacher .
is 76 percent . when i test , two months later , the result was 76 percent .
and after eight days , he wanted to be <unk> da vinci .
these are penguins .
so , i look at the dark side of the darkness on the <unk> side of the subject of mirrors that have been orphaned by the moon .
if i had to reduce all the history on a picture , what would it be ?
and i &apos;m going to show you a couple of snippets from my other big project in this year . &quot; the tempest &quot; -- the storm .
and our little life ends up into a sleep .
bono : &quot; they are misled .
i know you can understand that .
so , blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both play in africa .
it &apos;s another one that uses the interface of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> <unk> that we have , and what price people would pay for that , so they would have the dignity of the election .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mother could not understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we released two <unk> and 10 tv tv .
and that little <unk> to remove itself out of his tracks , and that was a problem .
this is very good . it &apos;s going to slow down .
i &apos;d like to show you a video from a few of the models i work with .
use of <unk> <unk> and behavior is the second part , and that will actually be the key to use these models for <unk> .
thank you .
now , trying to leave you with just how to take a arrow with the <unk> end , and it was hard work , and young , young , i &apos;ve learned a lot of respect for nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even <unk> developments , as <unk> as <unk> -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and the university of los angeles .
are you careful , just scribble out of wood or something like that .
i didn &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they go forever .
that &apos;s about two billion .
it takes him about &quot; three years of <unk> . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one thing .
but for me , this is great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we live in human mind and machines .
i have quite clear . where are you going to come from ?
it &apos;s too afraid that the way in which the way we could die in 20 to 30 years .
all the evidence that it focuses on that is that this cancer is transmitted by a virus .
i took the opportunity , and i took a few samples of jonas &apos; tumor and a few samples of other parts of the other parts .
it took him to the veterinarian , and this discovered something <unk> .
in addition , cancer is a <unk> consequence of the ability of our cells to be able to fit and adapt their environment .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and that &apos;s a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for it .
and that &apos;s the third reason , why don &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t feel the numbers on them .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for the optimism bias .
but the good news is that our illusion isn &apos;t broken when we &apos;re aware of this .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , the incrementally goes back to mitigate again than half of the world &apos;s population and over half of the global economy .
you could look at this as the privatization of <unk> .
after once , the soviets had <unk> <unk> , it was like , &quot; that &apos;s the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi , your view of china &apos;s view of china &apos;s going to be something different than if you live in beijing life in beijing life .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re going to do this in bigger historic context , we will be able to do that process .
how do we define our national interests so that it &apos;s not just a <unk> basis yet .
that &apos;s the conventional approach .
this one has typically the responsibility of <unk> to guarantee a stable <unk> .
they &apos;re long dependent on each other .
jobs for who ? especially for young men .
after usually the law is collapsed , you can &apos;t even get <unk> .
the quality of care , by the way , by the conflict , the government .
this is the silhouette of my hometown of new orleans .
the military did it . it &apos;s called climate change , which is secure and stability as governments in the world , as governments in the world , to react to how to react .
it allows you to be productive to become productive , so that you can afford the insurance itself .
these are certainly inspirational examples , if we feel able to plan for a self-replicating world .
don &apos;t listen to how chinese student practice english by calling it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that implies things like the concrete world with <unk> <unk> , abstractions , which we &apos;re trying to do to make sure , and we also take the hypothetical seriously , and we &apos;re going to ask the hypothetical seriously , we &apos;re going to ask ourselves , what might be like what is .
we thought people before they went into the scientific age , and he found that these people were resistant to one side of the concrete world .
and then luria said , &quot; on the north pole , there &apos;s always snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york .
it wasn &apos;t just the spread of cognitively demanding professions .
would you put it to be killed ? &quot;
you might say , you know , a mess .
it feels like i landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
and they <unk> me to make a degree in anything .
he &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris created it with personal victims , this film <unk> .
i &apos;m one of their <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is serious . &quot;
we were all angry on them , &quot; why are you doing that ?
that &apos;s going to be much more true when you read it . &quot;
we &apos;ve had spent the game always played for weeks , about seven weeks , and we had basically all 50 <unk> <unk> in the world .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
many people <unk> good jobs and called the <unk> .
it &apos;s like its own little compound .
if i took all three legs of it , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so all you do is -- it &apos;s a very <unk> case -- this old <unk> and this old plastic is &#91; unclear &#93; . this <unk> goes very simply into an old <unk> .
that &apos;s possible if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or a <unk> school -- a leaf , a <unk> and a pen , no glue , no glue .
what we &apos;re doing is a very simple gestural coop .
this is a small straw of what you do , these two corners here here , it &apos;s going to be like a <unk> .
here are two magnets .
it was a lot of occupants on the ship , and she became bored , so the captain was on his deck .
in the <unk> conference , it shows <unk> gupta , but amazing plans to turn waste into really <unk> , <unk> , <unk> toys that can build kids themselves -- as they can learn about basic principles of science and design .
it was a big challenge , and it was actually examples of biology that gave a lot of evidence .
and there &apos;s a bunch of examples of projects that are trying to mimic ecosystems .
and with a little bit of planning , we can get a space which is dominated by traffic , which is open to the open space for people , to bring people back with food and waste waste into opportunities .
this photo was taken on the day of the b , and only one year later , it looked like this .
when you climb seawater , the first thing is calcium carbonate .
no , you have to explore the human experience with your <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i was looking for someone who &apos;s jewish because i &apos;m jewish and because i &apos;m very important .
but the actual <unk> was that there were lots of men who wanted to go with me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with ourselves .
it &apos;s like , as long as it &apos;s not on a two-wheeler .
i was trying to be like <unk> .
because you remember my favorite idea : you have to get a <unk> of 700 points , and nobody did this .
most of them . <unk> are 33 years old , not eight years old , and if we look at the <unk> demographics of the <unk> , the <unk> of tomorrow are older adults .
imagine that their vision is very , very good .
these <unk> have actually many other benefits in terms of attention , and one aspect of attention , which is too much more powerful , is our ability to track objects in our environment . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i &apos;d like to ask you to be aware of this outcome , and to put it in the context of another group of co-developers , a group that actually is high in our society , which is actually out of people who are running out of the multimedia-tasking .
so let me start with a task which is called mental rotation .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just run through all sorts of special errors that we &apos;re looking at .
so it was a big , very complex project that i didn &apos;t even know if it was going to work at all .
so , as alpha alpha knows about many , many things about many and many things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with its kind of elaborate , violent language and a great network of <unk> capacity , able to do a lot of lines .
so , with physical <unk> , we &apos;re used to be used to go around the world and see that certain kinds of material makes meaningful sense for certain kinds of freedoms and so forth .
so a few years ago , i was quite excited about discovery that there are candidates of candidates with incredibly simple rules that make special relativity successfully , and the general relativity and gravity , and the general relativity and gravity , and <unk> , and at least , to the mechanics of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , and teachers that <unk> me to hiv / aids .
they jump high . they &apos;re wearing red clothing .
because my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have a law on either , and automatically , everything that my family had had , in my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony we were excited , and we didn &apos;t slept all night .
he was wearing to look at this in a village that hadn &apos;t even known as <unk> roads . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , i would come back and do everything you want to ask me .
when it became pregnant in the marriage , the mother &apos;s done for it and punished .
as we speak , 91 girls are never going to be repeated again .
consumers , the 72 percent of american gdp in american gdp , are actually beginning , just like banks and company <unk> <unk> , their <unk> , in everyday life , to free itself from both obligations and risk that face us when we move forward .
and what you &apos;re looking at here is the whole phenomenon of the fact that we &apos;re actually <unk> and basically future education , the future kids of our households .
<unk> are about 48 percent , the cornell institute of <unk> .
we &apos;re looking at a trend in a little bit of <unk> tourism . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and neighborhoods , and the other emphasis of the neighbors as a support .
we &apos;re also watching a big <unk> .
the trend line is immense .
we then take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then i came to the question , i &apos;m the only one that does something like this ?
you could exploit them .
that &apos;s what i do in my life -- stories tell stories , novels , and today i &apos;d like to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling , and also some supernatural creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> might be shrinking . our hearts could <unk> , and our <unk> could <unk> if we were in the cultural world of cultural <unk> .
that &apos;s when i first encountered the first time , as i call it , &quot; representative foreigner . &quot;
i &apos;m not a <unk> , no refugee or <unk> . i &apos;m going to ask why i do that , but the commute of languages gives it to me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a manifestation of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge issue , because i got rid of it .
and we need to take care of the other side .
i could have a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe that &apos;s going to be a happy history , and in my next book i might write about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
you know , you get existing songs , you get existing songs , cut it into little bits , and you get this piece together , put it together , and so you get a new song , but this new song is clearly made out of old songs .
instead , these laws and laws are more concentrated than the property .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to reassure what it covers . <unk> alarm : the <unk> of the telephone by making a symbol of his finger .
our creativity comes from outside , not from inside .
and then they say , &quot; okay , but how do you see your address ? &quot;
in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see this limb there , a kind of a <unk> <unk> <unk> that &apos;s out of the limb .
our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now , that led to a understanding of the nuclear structure , because it &apos;s going to be so <unk> that atoms have a single nucleus with <unk> that circle it .
this is a picture of a galaxy , a <unk> , with , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think you can also last the <unk> ideas for us , about our place in the universe and really the value of our home culture .
that &apos;s here . that &apos;s home . that &apos;s us .
and with each light light and every touch of the screen , we like <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information all over the way through the digital woods .
when our daughter sat on the <unk> , i asked them , &quot; will you put a lot of value on musical competence ? &quot;
we can &apos;t <unk> <unk> .
now , i want to take you to that journey .
and because i was so much more quiet and excited , i decided to my best birthday , that i didn &apos;t speak to speak only one day -- a day .
and they &apos;re not talking ...
and i explained with a friend who &apos;s my sign mind that i was john francis that i was going through life that i didn &apos;t speak and that this would be the last time somebody would translate my wife .
well , i <unk> my backpack again .
i started speaking again because i had studied <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i took myself on every birthday of my silence , but never about my decision , just to use my feet .
born and raised in north korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in exchange for food .
i was constantly worried that i would be going back and forth .
i felt so powerless because i had a lot to eat so much , but my father died of starvation .
but i &apos;m sure that your gesture of love and is also the life of any other joseph and thousands of other journalists that have still hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for buildings , but that was much stronger than i would have expected to do , and as a industrial <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my profession as an architect , because we weren &apos;t helping , we didn &apos;t work for society , but for privileged people , rich , government , government .
and then in the following year , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in kobe in japan .
so i wonder what &apos;s a <unk> and what a building building ?
but this is really needed .
so we &apos;re learning some of the most important things in our lives before we &apos;re born , in the womb .
so , fetuses are actually learning the particular language , which is spoken in the world where they are born in the world .
it creates a mixture of people that are so individually and curious , like the woman himself .
why should you have malnutrition in the womb ?
you can also see <unk> , but you can see other eyes .
this confidence in the <unk> is for any kind of <unk> .
the audience will be on <unk> <unk> , which are quite bizarre , but not with what &apos;s happening in front of your eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it might even give us the smile .
you might remember this as the <unk> <unk> , ok , at the time when the greatest traditional typical of all time .
if you &apos;re a high animal in the middle of unesco , and someone says , &quot; what do you actually do for the eliminating of hunger in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we start a business plan ?
this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t argue that strategy is playing a role .
and to me , all the music became .
now , when i use my software , the camera sees the <unk> , and you see the place of <unk> in relation to the <unk> , and it &apos;s got a whiteboard .
i remember that the poor had a little <unk> -- food , clothing , shelter -- what they didn &apos;t have .
i actually felt a <unk> of shame <unk> .
now , because i listened to him , i was excited by various reasons .
i didn &apos;t even be asked to give a donation , which is my kind of thing .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the history of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving us a chance to engage what their dignity would say , a partnership , no resemblance , which is based on a traditional kind of donation , magic can happen to magic . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt
it &apos;s a very <unk> combination , a very strong combination .
right now , currently the beginning is at the beginning , and it &apos;s very clear to me , it &apos;s very clear that it &apos;s only one vehicle , only one tool .
what &apos;s the future of humanity ?
now i &apos;m going to turn to the second big question : are we alone or are there other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions is that we &apos;ve done remarkable advances in the last hundred years .
look at this .
here are photographs of me .
the rate at 18 months and every <unk> member of the <unk> knows , that &apos;s the <unk> law .
but what about them ? what will it do to you ?
they sail in their <unk> across the sky and occasionally they <unk> people for experiments that their parents wouldn &apos;t agree .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
in many generations , these experiments couldn &apos;t do it at all .
and what i found was that the first technology was <unk> million years ago in the form of <unk> .
we can learn a lot of it .
and i look at <unk> and trying to protect my child , because with a child , you don &apos;t leave anyone alone , even a minister .
and secondly , they tell us that she had a <unk> gang , but a series of adaptations had lost trees from trees .
we &apos;ve got our knowledge about our ancestors in principle of adult individuals , because the fossils , the <unk> , are missing .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> explores the origin of humanity in the long history , and he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a great child , and what we could learn about our human being .
and if all of you to think about the rules , you need to have an effective system of <unk> and <unk> , because as we &apos;ve been covering , in all trust , we need trust .
it &apos;s seen as high seas , because the continent of <unk> <unk> was left .
we need to work locally , but also all the self-organizing .
we need to create a new paradigm of caution and respect .
<unk> <unk> says , &quot; i would pay to do what i do . &quot;
that &apos;s probably a good idea .
and to say that i &apos;m journalist , i &apos;m a journalist , i &apos;m not a technologist , so i want to give quickly a sketch , like the present and the future .
so , i think we all need to think about whether we want that reality is going to be our reality -- and if what it means to our idea of life , for anything that &apos;s going to happen .
it looks like <unk> .
the symptoms of the complex are that you have the strong and far-right of the right to have the right answer , no matter how hard the problem is .
cesar and i tried to write an article for the new york times and explain how it works .
of course we can .
and deserve a lot of money .
it &apos;s more than the <unk> of americans .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to try . it &apos;s probably all wrong .
<unk> immediately . &quot;
and <unk> trying to do it again , but he could never prove the presumption .
i &apos;m going to argue that our approach is not portable .
china wants to have that in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even slow down even further .
the future is naturally <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s going to be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen soon -- with safety in our lifespan -- but we &apos;re more than ever to overcome it .
and here you get to play .
and what we need to think about is : when you dance in flames , what &apos;s next ?
and we believed we can hold these debt to our kids , but imagine it .
everything else is <unk> .
that &apos;s the financial crisis .
students wanted to know what the stage of development is the cell .
should not be amazing , right ?
all we have got synesthetic .
you will be able to focus your mind , maybe you can do a series of things , you can &apos;t do a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
that &apos;s not 1,000 years in the distance .
we should let those cheap , simple <unk> polymer , and i don &apos;t have anyone to use them for their children . &quot;
and here we can see that <unk> .
we can &apos;t risk the trust of customers .
he could only get 500 and have to get to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge amount of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week when you &apos;re sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know it , the kind of web -- the things that we all talk about -- is a little less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s been the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web only 5,000 days .
so when we say , the machine that we &apos;re facing is now a <unk> , a human brain , if we look at the rate of that , in 30 years , six billion <unk> .
now it &apos;s not that -- if you do a table and things at work , you &apos;re going to be a word , you &apos;re not going to be part of the web but you &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to be the broader senses of machine . &quot; in a sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the levels of parts or ideas or words , if you want it to be .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be doing .
third , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous , it will fill our entire environment and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i was convinced that the second <unk> of jesus christ had found that it was sun transcendent moon , and that i had been inspired by god and prepared to become the <unk> .
these are the dead deaths of <unk> .
and it allows everything . it makes all kinds of things .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple notions of how we work things .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just completed in <unk> for a massive <unk> that came out of this process , it &apos;s the result of a multiplicity of forces that are developing .
and that led straight into another project .
it &apos;s actually a wrong attitude , because the hybrid is likely to be more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are helping to the living of a young people .
and at the end of one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
each one of them turns into his neighbors .
that &apos;s how we would have to pay for a second .
so we have a large brain , which is a big advantage because we can impact our environment .
now , my story is the two brains . it may surprise it , our gut has a <unk> brain .
this is very , very important , because there can be <unk> .
we &apos;ve learned to talk to the big brain , flavor and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , at some point , we were all like animals and then no longer . &quot;
these are men and women who are even familiar with even 250 stars in the night sky .
and of course , the <unk> monks that said that .
the <unk> , the post where the sun is falling , is actually a <unk> , which is constantly changing the light that goes through the holy <unk> of machu picchu , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
if you pray for the dead , you do it with the hands of these gestures that you put your thoughts into the sky .
here &apos;s the place where the great mother has <unk> the <unk> into the world , which is the mountains of the mountains and the homeland of the world that they call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique <unk> of human imagination .
this material you all know about is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s a little bit of toxic white stuff .
i put it in there , they fit there in , because in a hundred years , my body can back back into the ground .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to apply it all over the world and don &apos;t have to be concerned about <unk> or <unk> , because you have many alternatives .
first , they start putting atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve launched a competition called &quot; dance your <unk> . &quot;
my country is about 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s much more than all the speakers in front of me and all the ones that come to me .
and she thought about my work in mathematical models to create a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience likes not -- from very closely , cultural reasons , they hold it for boring -- and find another pattern much more interesting -- a different pattern .
you can think about two ways .
when you throw a coin , you get a sequence of your head and number .
back to more secular <unk> , because of which you were dealing with uncertainty .
and only one percent accuracy .
he said , &quot; i suppose that after a sudden death in a family , the likelihood remains to another . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet quite unlikely .
the whole quality control , the implications of the industrial impact has been <unk> by statistics .
the <unk> has saved hundreds of thousands of lives in the world .
a clever outlet prevents injuries because the current is used until a intelligent <unk> is recognized .
but , on the other hand , china is a <unk> . a conception of <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;ve got facebook , we have <unk> .
but nevertheless , the <unk> can create a very strong force , which there &apos;s never been in the history of china .
as a result , chinese china as a proper medium is not just as mere headlines .
like a big ted , not ?
so in the last three years , <unk> <unk> really changed , they had more and more transparent , because they have no access to the data .
increasingly , more chinese can see free speech and human rights than their <unk> counterparts , rather than a city of america .
many of you know that the beethoven was an obscure place .
i &apos;m not suggesting that they cannot live a wonderful life .
girl : now , my sister can pretty nerves .
the acoustics of music is much more complicated than the language .
this is a fiddle .
and it seems like his <unk> had been removed , to try and see the death toll , and his skull was stopped on the side of his side .
cl : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
when i look at myself , in this <unk> , i see a special audience .
in many countries , this is another thing .
at this crucial point in the dutch story , my father was on the waterfront of the <unk> river in the near <unk> .
civil war and oppression has been declining since the end of the cold war .
my soldiers use their guns as tools of peace .
peter van heerden : why i took a gun
this program gets a shape , and then there &apos;s 250 ways .
this is a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in the middle of the yosemite .
you can &apos;t let loose .
i &apos;m very interested in the two of them .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example . but there &apos;s actually a theoretical argument for why technology is evolved in <unk> ways .
now , the evolution of our species took hundreds of thousands of years , and because of these interactions , evolution used to develop evolution as the next step , to take the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can use the third scale .
over the last 50 years , we had 28 percent of <unk> growth in dollars a year .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
in order of computing growth of computing , 1,000 dollars in computing is about the brain of a insect or a mouse or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to reach the full maturity of these trends , and they have to look at how often the screw in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to that point .
you can put blessing and <unk> .
they &apos;re harder to do .
they were taken from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing here there . you know , supposedly , you don &apos;t have anything .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that &apos;s related to <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we call the schizophrenia .
and he was so funny to post that and give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought experiment earlier , you &apos;re in the african <unk> .
september 11th has a <unk> . it &apos;s a conspiracy .
and we have our own <unk> , and we have a <unk> product .
i was not as good as he did , but we managed to bring <unk> <unk> , <unk> , tracy chapman and bruce <unk> on a <unk> for amnesty , and that was a great experience .
and they said , &quot; she &apos;s telling us the truth . &quot;
musicians and activist peter gabriel talks his personal motivation , with the <unk> <unk> for human rights and shares stories of active <unk> .
next to us , how do you do that ?
he recognizes the problem , and knows about dealing with it . the dance is his favorite surveillance that allows him to orient . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the beetle adds much less juice on the pill , when they &apos;re not wearing any <unk> , than if they &apos;re not wearing .
this is our <unk> experimenter .
let &apos;s take a <unk> and watch what &apos;s going on .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to cheat into those big adventure , not entirely connected to my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother is going to be a <unk> in antarctica .
so the whole purpose of the presentation is to convince the vc that they &apos;re the entrepreneurs that are going to invest and make a lot of money with it .
and from the experience to create a company or to lead a company -- that doesn &apos;t have to be companies .
there are no financially learning , where there were no problems .
from there they take them -- on a solid , very maternal path , straight from beginning to end .
when i know someone who created a device like this .
no , they &apos;re not .
then you give me a quick <unk> .
even if the competition is working to shape patterns ...
it was positive , positive , positive , more secure .
when you follow my superintendent , you &apos;re going to have a <unk> , very <unk> presentation . that &apos;s great to <unk> who you are and to <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know that , that &apos;s pretty cool .
statistically one of them is a beetle .
if you look something , you might have a impact on it .
and when you get enough of it , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the table in the last place than the culture that innovation doesn &apos;t exist .
as we think and behave , it makes our <unk> .
we have a serious meme to be serious .
but forgive me , the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the largest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very rare .
our thinking is backwards .
through a <unk> change , change , for example , transparency , for example , for example , and collaboration and collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are focused on results .
because it &apos;s only the challenge of the only way that things are always done , the only possibility for us to get rid of the old <unk> , and to find new creative solutions for the problems of today . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
because we can &apos;t make it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and if we can do that , and share the ideas of play , we can make bulgaria to something better .
the newspaper for <unk> means , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my master took me to the <unk> , because the <unk> was at that time .
and after i took them with a gesture of <unk> , they were very -- i was accepted , and i was working for about six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you already know -- all of the things .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we took several papers , we did our homework , but where we were looking , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture arose literally in seconds after my baby was placed into the poor , and i got it over and over .
rg : oh yea .
av : taboo number three : about his grandmother , you don &apos;t speak -- but i &apos;m going to talk about my talk today .
and the general idea is that every aspect of my life has become better than i was born in the world of birth and family .
but you realize that you &apos;re going to be able to lose control of control of the control , which is how we think of our lives a lot of meaning , and what &apos;s really disturbing .
<unk> + av : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with glenn gould .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a consequence of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve seen all the &quot; star caesar &quot; with the <unk> .
imagine if you &apos;re going to hear a long time ago today , as you might play personally , john <unk> walker shows how footage can look at the exact <unk> and <unk> .
now , since then , since then we experienced a time of extraordinary economic research , the longest recovery in the history of this country .
but now , a few months later , how good politicians might be in it , &quot; in the <unk> apple , &quot; in the <unk> apple , &quot; as a result , you can &apos;t feel your uncertainty , you can &apos;t hide yet .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that until i met this guy , one at the time , a little <unk> guy who was <unk> by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
but in fact , interestingly , that &apos;s a future where society is a few <unk> of capitalism , which is how do you integrate the dna of <unk> innovation into society by trying to do things and then the ones that work , and then the ones that work , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to show you a intriguing new hypothesis and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve worked on about the structure of the language that you &apos;re talking about , and your propensity to saving .
and if i want to talk right , <unk> <unk> me , constantly thinking about it .
now , that &apos;s a <unk> theory .
let &apos;s put that device on the device that &apos;s going on with your <unk> , so that i can measure your blood vessel .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in exchange for regular pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the skill is to communicate across generations .
now , we &apos;re kind of <unk> them .
but i &apos;m against it as a hurdle .
but they didn &apos;t get the results that they wanted .
at the same time , i was working on the field of <unk> , although i was a ph.d. in <unk> <unk> .
humans and <unk> and birds and the birds and everything , the red line here is high . these are people , livestock and pets .
we focused on serious <unk> of the future and produced products for the company .
let &apos;s look at the next video .
that flew night on the party last night , and -- you can see it just <unk> , and you can see every stall that you want .
and he was great about how people were teaching the buddhist religion in india at the time .
and he went back to the village of the village .
and he &apos;s got to keep his eyes , so it &apos;s so disgusting , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re looking at ourselves . we take a sense of memory of a mother and all of these creatures in this meditation .
and you &apos;re thinking about how <unk> things are , if you &apos;re happy if you &apos;re happy .
and of course , they are cruel and <unk> to others .
even though the change in your mind makes something for other living creatures , you feel that new quality in you , and you already have them , and you &apos;ve got them as a role model .
so the coffee cup is , or the cup of handle , one of society using tools to preserve public health .
in fact , complexity is very high .
we heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple when you know how to read it .
ok , let me close with four <unk> comments , an example and two aphorisms .
and i don &apos;t want to stop you with details , but you &apos;ll see an example of what we have for that .
did you start doing that ?
and so , what happens to the things that ben has talked about , what &apos;s our new kind of organization , or should we reflect : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things are going to be less going to be able to be done in use , in collaboration with the <unk> .
so for instance , for example , which yochai has already mentioned before .
it &apos;s also going to be <unk> , professional arguments .
so it &apos;s not going to be a <unk> of two bearings , but between these camps , there are all kinds of interesting positions that are going to be taken by people .
that costs about 100 dollars .
and then people started to dedicate their <unk> , and in fact , a team then made it : between new and spain .
and the first thing i thought about was to thank him for it .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so , people are calling up and have news like this .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m attracted to my batman to true my anonymity . &quot;
and the one who didn &apos;t have done a lot , so she turned out to be in a different town and took a new job .
and in the last 35 years , i studied human behavior on the basis of all possible , from genes over neurotransmitter , dopamine and rollercoaster , to the <unk> .
some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
that was one of these cases , because at her , there was no force under their ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re very similar to each other as you can only be .
and by the way , i &apos;ve got an email by this morning , which is that we &apos;ve completed the last part of atlas today .
and these guys here are the weak force that maybe most of the time .
so if you want to know , why the sky is blue or why atomic nuclei , you ought to be in principle , with a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape you have .
the comparison is that the people in this room is the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really like that with this theory of the big bang of the big bang , which is a totally beautiful prediction . the model hasn &apos;t made that this is happening , but it seems to do it .
and they created this civilization , this wonderful picture , the darkness into light , and that allows the civilization to see the civilization from all .
another great insight came from a study of university university university in 2010 , the baseball maps of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in a similar trial in germany , researchers are using scientists to <unk> <unk> , and after they were imprisoned in the face to suppress smile .
&quot; because the colors that they have ordered , not the european standards , he answered .
&quot; safer ? why ? were there were more policemen ? &quot;
so , we built the light <unk> , which people , people of <unk> , to think that they were going to go to abroad , when they were <unk> to make their sense .
president roosevelt said , &quot; believe you can do something , and you &apos;ve got half of them . &quot;
in port-au-prince , entrepreneur arose and offered for mobile phones for cellphones .
one user for the hiv power of technology is going to be in kibera .
by 2015 , there will be three billion squatters in the world .
in the shops of the environment , <unk> , batteries and bread .
this flow of time is embedded in all embedded : the erosion of a <unk> , in the <unk> , which is <unk> to the rose .
read a interview with a writer ?
and also , when i look at the big bear , i remember looking at how i was a child on his head as a child , not from his shoulders , and i feel like this child .
we &apos;ve been seeing how creative technology can be and in our lives and our lives , we can do the solutions , innovations and moments that don &apos;t <unk> the flow of time , but make again .
my mother was <unk> .
in every single refugee , they had to <unk> soldiers , which was the nine brother mark , who was nine , take a child soldier and they wanted to make a child soldier .
and i should do it alone .
play anything you want to have , from the suitcase .
and then i ended up in <unk> , because i didn &apos;t feel my feelings .
thank you .
so almost everything on earth is going to be about five times away .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should that play a role ?
so , in fact , we can grow every single organ out of any cell .
this is the increase in less than 10 years .
here &apos;s the upshot .
when the rotors go down with the same speed , the robot .
and you look at how robust the control is .
and he does that , as he <unk> .
they take their neighbors true .
this is showing us that we can double the <unk> , <unk> , where we can get them to form teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where it wants to go .
i can feel that . but there &apos;s so much so many , and i &apos;m going to give you your horizon , your consciousness open , and you &apos;re changing your perspective on honeybees .
this has been a huge problem , basically since the late 1980s with the late 1980s , which is a lot of different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
they don &apos;t experience that .
they take the chefs for their courts , and the honey -- there are <unk> -- they use the honey to their bars .
the bee dies . honeybees dying when they stick , so they didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now , now , why is this : why is that ?
and of course , we have it , especially in the last decade , we &apos;ve done the world with a dense chain of <unk> , with a chain of global trade .
and never before that many people weren &apos;t aware of this fact .
in fact , many of you don &apos;t know that our bread was not european invention .
and in fact , in the middle of <unk> and china , it &apos;s going to collapse .
for most people , there &apos;s not a lot of farmers among them , and there &apos;s not a lot of farmers among them , to be able to pollute the environment , to be in large scales to destroy environment .
it all goes together .
and so while i do my bread done -- and i &apos;ve got it <unk> , and i &apos;m trying not to burn the hands .
and then it needs to be a long time to keep living in the world where there &apos;s available tools to be able to fix materials and <unk> .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , analyzes and shops and develop a new technology , and it &apos;s quantitative <unk> .
because i hope you &apos;ll take this from here today , a new connected with nature .
this was a few days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what &apos;s our answer ?
this is a recent year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them . and shekhar kapur , a film about them , <unk> queen , they should see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is actually <unk> as an ecologist .
this is a <unk> patient who was at the time -- it really took a bypass arm , but it &apos;s got to be a <unk> , but he &apos;s got to do for this .
i like this slide because you can tell you about what people really motivated to change , and what doesn &apos;t .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans eat even more fat than ever , and even more carbs . so that &apos;s lower , but the actual amount of higher , but the actual amount of higher , is to reduce both .
one of the <unk> studies found that 70 percent of people were clogged , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 54 percent of people had bad breath -- that &apos;s not a healthy diet .
on the other hand , it &apos;s all intimacy <unk> , <unk> .
i hope it &apos;s not going to stick .
the film is based on a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
two <unk> were involved in the project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had extensive passion to make the <unk> and technology .
we were so focused on motion .
the number of seemed to be infinite .
and that &apos;s the data that we get from that , and then they &apos;re used for the model .
and this is what the finished picture looked like in the movie .
this was a very , very early rehearsal .
and we found this , in the middle of karnataka .
and it has its own <unk> .
people are going to be able to overcome these <unk> , <unk> past where they live their lives .
we were too <unk> -- two bedouin as a driver -- and imagine that this gap is an ocean from sand , 40 degrees centigrade , a water bottle .
i think the camel is the best animal animal in the world . &quot;
and they use them as much as we see our <unk> .
we weigh our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you another film .
i don &apos;t <unk> until my body temperature have gone 40 degrees celsius -- enough to fire a egg .
<unk> , thank you for the invitation .
let &apos;s start with a poem with a poem . that would be an idea .
but what would you like to do when you never knew the next day , if you like a living god , your shoulders in the clouds , or if you &apos;re sitting down there from the wallpaper with your little <unk> <unk> with your little <unk> ?
who could be quiet in that night ?
but what you did was that judy <unk> in your age 150,000 dollars a film , that <unk> d <unk> <unk> the french army and <unk> pascal had cleaned up his room -- no wait , i mean he had invented the calculator ?
in the end , they were sitting in a tree , and they put their hand on the tree .
and the human genome project is more than that , but if you take those two columns , you probably wouldn &apos;t have a lot left .
and also , we have the problem with elephants that you can &apos;t build construction that would be too hard for a single elephant .
one component of them is understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; the ability to understand the feelings of the other and share . &quot;
so now we &apos;re discovering more complicated expressions . here &apos;s consolation .
that the test is not good for you .
there &apos;s a very simple task that you have to do .
a philosopher wrote even that it was impossible that writers had invented a sense of fairness , because the fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now , it &apos;s not a lonely joke , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of things .
the last decade i spent investigating pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say , thank god .
so , i stopped , in a sense , it was a success .
over the years , the serious meme can make a serious argument .
a.j. jacobs : how the healthy life of life is almost disgusting
and i think a lot of people sharing this view .
a really cool thing .
now these studies scientifically valid and they have been reproduced , but they &apos;re not the whole story .
ask after the part of the story , which is not told .
a priest ?
finally , one group that believes that the indus people are the ancestors of the people in today &apos;s rights .
left to left , how many ? okay .
it can be useful to create more data to create more data , which is <unk> .
this sign is the main image of the indus script , and only in this text , it seems to be twice .
it turns out there &apos;s been a long tradition in india , on the ground of <unk> at the time of <unk> at the time of birth .
space space , we all know what it looks like .
this wire <unk> <unk> , which would make the name of the bell famous .
indirectly had made the historical discovery that <unk> can also make radio waves .
all of the young people in the city .
someone who &apos;s sitting next to you -- this is ok in a <unk> , you &apos;d sit on a <unk> <unk> , and someone would sit so tightly next to you , then you would be <unk> .
the dalai lama always wants to say -- he says , when you make the idea of <unk> , it &apos;s because you realize that you &apos;re watching yourself and your pain and joy , you end up having a little playground for your intelligence .
but take this wonderful thing that &apos;s been shown to us , and they accuse us fear of ourselves .
a man in front of a shell became a picture that became a symbol of the resistance of the resistance .
but what would you not have done anything to do if you had the modern median to create a sense that the wrong thing was going to be wrong , immediately it had to be done ?
combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize global globally with the challenges that are now <unk> us and the largely global nature .
in the museum of the children , in rwanda , there &apos;s a picture of a <unk> young -- and the museum of children who were killed , when in the training of rwanda , one million people died .
here &apos;s the task : help me build a vibrant , <unk> <unk> in 3d .
you can move on very different <unk> -- it vary in the <unk> , the motion of the surface and the <unk> .
this is a driving algae here .
boy : <unk> .
and let &apos;s slow down to see the spikes in action .
mark cutkosky at stanford , one of my partners , is an extraordinary engineer , which was a technique called <unk> <unk> incubator , where he could fit directly into a artificial foot .
they almost look like from extraterrestrial , and the secret to what they can do , are their <unk> toes .
so we &apos;re going to pull the band-aid off .
these <unk> structures allow it to add spines , <unk> and <unk> , to look at very delicate , tough surfaces .
so it &apos;s a long nice long term named <unk> , which is <unk> as an <unk> and males as females to find each other and to choose a partner .
so if you &apos;re less than 20 meters away , you have to do less than half the time .
when we think about animals like dolphins , we need to be able to think about the consequences of our interventions in the clear that we felt quite surprising .
after the <unk> , the <unk> has made these kinds of systems to learn what the scientists could hear .
they just listen to the low frequencies .
when male and females are using this signal to find a partner , and they &apos;re scattered , imagine what the implications that we have in the recovery of the road species . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so , as ships <unk> can be done . they found that with a better <unk> <unk> of these noise to 90 percent of these noise to 90 percent .
they <unk> the speed at 50 percent .
we see alien worlds , we see strangers <unk> , 300 people , and they &apos;re going to be more . and they &apos;re not like us .
you have all sorts of opportunities .
we observe a continual rise in the men .
and obviously there &apos;s also one , the a hundred .
so with initiatives like the 100 laptop laptop , it reminded me that we put a whole new generation of people into the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think none of it is the problem .
now , our daily life is , however , <unk> said , in an extraordinary condition , let &apos;s say in a <unk> .
normally , it &apos;s one or two a year .
and you have them !
but we &apos;re a lot of suspense .
part of the challenge was to try and get rhythm and space , not just my hands -- as juggling is much more <unk> -- but the rhythm of my body and the <unk> , and the balls to control with my feet .
and then they play crazy .
ok , because you all don &apos;t understand what &apos;s a <unk> , i give you a little hint .
now , you know , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you have the one on the top here , which is the <unk> principle , all of his life , ok ?
gradually -- and then it &apos;s going to go . just a small number of time .
it &apos;s working through space and straight in the room in a different way .
and then <unk> <unk> .
this year -- you can show the slides -- in this year , we &apos;ve got the <unk> with us , a project where we have helped design in design .
we can do this on a <unk> , which is allowed to put more information on the poles , as you go through those <unk> .
( scott scott : i realized that i was on the way to be expert in the <unk> .
and we &apos;re going to give it a new product tonight . it &apos;s the first time it &apos;s been shown publicly .
in fact , the farmer can only be in the rainy season , not in the <unk> .
electrons go in a kind of <unk> , and then only energy . and energy you can &apos;t see .
that &apos;s what he thought was there .
many , potatoes have taken 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
all right . atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
and someone said to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s the sense of behind , huh ?
we &apos;ve been around for about four years .
when google digitized a book , they bring it into a very nice format .
i &apos;ll give you an example .
suddenly , in the middle of the 40s , everybody was excited .
but imagine you &apos;re not going to be interested in it .
but also , a lot of the on the right that seems to be a matter of propaganda .
if you look at the <unk> , it means &quot; <unk> &quot; with one a. &quot;
when i run this pink sound for longer than a few minutes , they would literally stop hearing it .
many people air to headphones , but these transform large , public spaces like these , shared <unk> , in millions tiny little personal little personal little personal little personal little bits of tiny .
you can do that in a nice place , like a sea .
and then finally , an acronym .
and i said , &quot; that &apos;s my job . &quot;
thank you so much for being here . we &apos;re all grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they weren &apos;t on us on the shuttle , and we couldn &apos;t see the exchange that occurred between me and my favorite career , a exchange that was fair to give us fair , but <unk> .
now , i &apos;ll tell you , in the last year last year , there &apos;s a lot of competition in the last year because the arab spring is still out of sync , which is <unk> -- what else ?
this picture was even in an <unk> , and on the ground , you see the <unk> of the police that were tracked by the police .
the kids are just taking pictures in a class that teachers get them to put them on the <unk> .
in today , it &apos;s about the brain , and , b , somewhere out there is a <unk> .
this is something that we can work in our lifetimes , and i believed i could get a difference , and i &apos;d try to get out of the <unk> to get into the <unk> .
but sometimes , science has some other traits that they really do really interesting .
what &apos;s going to bring us more data ?
there &apos;s something we think , it &apos;s obviously wrong , but wrong .
it &apos;s that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we &apos;re not looking at the alligator as very intelligent , not in a human kind .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the most <unk> part of the neocortex , with the name of the neocortex , and nature has done this little trick .
it &apos;s not that you look down there and say , &quot; what do i see ?
not like a <unk> . not least like a <unk> .
these are the things that are going to come first .
we need a little police , we need some military , but only to defense .
you can see it on your side . &quot;
she traveled because she was at the time of elections outside of the country .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then when she closes the door , she said , &quot; no , no , no , no .
they would wash : by hand .
this group uses three , everyone .
it &apos;s real .
it has been taught to learn english and to learn that as a vice president .
the computer has already been , at one of three , in one of three .
if you know , you think differently than the employer of the united states , which are actually part of our <unk> , because that &apos;s what we did .
we repeated the experiment with the same groups , but a delay is a prerequisite between the enlightenment of how we deal with the data , and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
the price of this is the threat of paradise .
and they moved and rubbed each other , and they flooded their arms in each other , and they <unk> their arms .
we &apos;re really good at thinking about skills and safety and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you ask the personal trainer , the <unk> halves like <unk> versus bad breath .
i don &apos;t feel emotion with emotion .
the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to peer into other people &apos;s head and figure out what they offer .
they own <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s what makes the subconscious smell .
what we found was between <unk> , raped of many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey start ?
and that it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
sb : this is learning how to do research on this research . let &apos;s learn how to do that research . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
well , first of all , i blame the queen because it &apos;s funny .
we need to be different .
the bad words -- you see , when someone comes to a place and he doesn &apos;t find it on the map , then he &apos;s like , &quot; this map sucks ! &quot;
they think , &quot; ok , if we remember that words are tools that we use to look at our thoughts , how do you know that they are better than hammer ?
the <unk> has taken 33 different <unk> definitions for &quot; set . &quot;
and then there &apos;s this mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in britain .
i have all the time &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
so , i &apos;m offering a chair .
and to make a long story short , i &apos;ve been here .
and with that , play for play , in this three days , you begin to understand , why why am i listening to all this <unk> stuff ?
you might be familiar with a ted speaker , and you can run the conversation during the year , and next year , after the same <unk> and emotional journey .
the manufacturers don &apos;t have the <unk> <unk> in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not secure what the public would start with as mysterious as the <unk> , which could even fold on the palm of the hand .
and that &apos;s where you had been worried about whether that was already available , and it was not able to find the channel to find the channel .
so instead of explaining the <unk> , you &apos;re going to do it .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call us <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> and we live and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a <unk> people .
we &apos;re arguing about what the world needs now is nuclear -- is nuclear -- right or wrong ?
and until now , there are only three key points for that -- coal and gas , destruction , which is almost anywhere -- and nuclear power .
we &apos;ve become the russian warheads where they have been transformed into electricity .
<unk> emissions are the emissions of all greenhouse gases and particles that are causing warming , and it has become the co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the spread of nuclear weapons is because we know that india and pakistan secretly have developed by <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
it &apos;s a lot larger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear , right ?
and in the senate of the united states , we need the support of both parties -- only one or two voices are necessary to help global warming in the senate , and that hall can help .
we &apos;re not going to get rid of conventional energy .
i &apos;ve been worried about the 10,000 years of success .
thank you .
that was -- my motivation was driven by apollo <unk> .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some fewer people , and the available technology that &apos;s going to allow us to study exploration of space .
a hundred groups of seven countries took on the competition , each one of whom was between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them into space .
and the potential for the sponsors is the sum of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would you be surprised to us ?
what that means is that you can carve yourself . you can get incredibly small .
the challenge was , how do we express this new algorithmic order in a column .
what i didn &apos;t know at the time , because we had seen the outside , that the surfaces were moving on , in the column , and that was a pretty surprising discovery .
from the process of lebanon , michael <unk> <unk> <unk> algorithms , the incredible , intriguing forms with millions of surfaces , no man could design it by hand , but you can build them , and they could be able to build the understanding of architecture . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / they could revolutionize our understanding of architecture .
so you look at this picture here -- many forms dance here for you .
it &apos;s a very rare condition .
this is a drug that was developed for cancer .
you can see , the chip , even the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s led by young people .
and i think a lot of people here in the room , many of them are in the same position as i am .
so i think women are going to be leaders in our society because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations , to preserve our cultural identities .
and we &apos;ve realized that since recently , more people are using the tools and social networking to give their stories to their stories , to show their pictures and to tell their own stories of their own voices . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
at the same time , we invite them to explore and to explore our part of the world .
that &apos;s how i got more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; maybe if i make these ants a few apartments , they &apos;re going to be there . &quot;
this is called &quot; eternal house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i finished it , i came back the next day .
it went ...
my work , roughly <unk> , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you can &apos;t always anticipate .
and i cut it off , and shaped it to the <unk> .
so i did the needle .
it &apos;s a very ambitious job , but the best things come in little <unk> .
they expect their employees to do what they asked them to do when they did the task , they can do it .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of consciousness , this absolute fabric of consciousness , consciousness , an absolute center of compassion and love that is the primary attributes of divinity .
my <unk> body flew into a direction , my <unk> bike into the other .
i &apos;d like to do all the teds i would probably not do with them , the <unk> that i might not have predicted you , the friends i would not look at , the friends i would be able to look at , the <unk> that i could do with you .
because then you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you look at you from the back , you can just erase it , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> in the dirt . &quot;
20 years ago , doctors would have taken my leg and hoped , and there was a 15 <unk> .
as i got more and more . and at that point in my life , i was probably 14 lbs lighter than i am now .
and nobody celebrates these modern <unk> in my eyes more than david black .
running to run , is the threshold of what makes us human .
he &apos;s president of the international exchange for <unk> , which is the least <unk> name that i &apos;ve ever heard of .
he was born for three and a half months too early , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .
so once i tried to approach the piano , i became nervous <unk> .
and at the end you were so quick that things like the bumblebee &quot; didn &apos;t have a problem , right ?
do you want to hear me ?
dp : &quot; tiger <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t <unk> that .
they &apos;re fighting their own lives in this forest , in a world that &apos;s even more clean , a world that hasn &apos;t yet yet , in a world that hasn &apos;t yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet yet .
so we know that today , you are capable of doing surveillance that the research has been impossible to be wrong with , when i started .
the long distances of the <unk> association association is coming to the mother that &apos;s developed during this long childhood , and the siblings can keep all the life long , and it can be only 60 years down to 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and even the vast repositories of <unk> in the forest are now meat , and so the pygmies that wound up in the <unk> , and there in their wonderful lifestyle , have lived so many hundreds of years .
yesterday , anyone said that .
we are now in every state , and the problems in florida are others than in new york .
and if you look down here , you get me down here ?
out there in the politicians ?
now , what we want to do in the lab is pretty much the same , but with a few dozen of different types of molecules -- such a <unk> reduction of complexity , but yet trying to create something <unk> .
it &apos;s actually very <unk> . once you start thinking , it &apos;s not really something .
now , where you &apos;re all experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play a game with these protocells .
again , we &apos;re going to see the circuitry of this body of <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black blobs of this black mud -- these <unk> , very complex , organic black mud .
in his lab , martin <unk> , &quot; protocells , &quot; experimental blobs of chemicals that are adapted to living cells . his work shows how life could be on earth first , and perhaps elsewhere .
this is a <unk> shot to lead their tadpole at the night .
what &apos;s the -- how did you know that ? you took it .
but if we did that to each of us -- every fire hydrant , we could redefine the emergency box .
so , the <unk> is the dirt , which is otherwise in your beautiful pink lungs , and that &apos;s going to be associated with -- it &apos;s going to be connected .
the birds could jump from one to another .
you can tell the stories of him . you can talk to him .
but that herd is going to be a great toll of our planet .
next is we <unk> the skin cells and multiply it in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working for thousands of years with <unk> , starting with products like wine , beer and yogurt .
it &apos;s true that if we do work on the world , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal pursuit of human beings to have a car .
let me just talk to you only about hydrogen .
that &apos;s a huge amount of energy efficient , generating energy .
if we can see these <unk> future , it can also be others .
you had to survive .
and we &apos;re sure to be our school system to get funding and support .
because why should our students drive so far away from their family ?
it became a book , then a performance .
it had an incredible idea , an incredible idea .
on the coast of the west coast , they destroyed their forest .
but in this picture , you see how we started building the <unk> , which was soon a large <unk> center .
when i first came to my time , i started to <unk> the <unk> subject of the <unk> .
when you zoom in in the south , you see the expansion of new york city as it was once , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map are represented by the <unk> parts of the road .
or the <unk> , the <unk> meadows , insects and <unk> places .
maybe it &apos;s also going to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s so much power to unite science and visual features that these pictures are going to arise . it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we have in our society at a really dramatic level of scale .
so i didn &apos;t have to get closer to that .
you can tell the pristine thing that &apos;s supposed to be .
that &apos;s a <unk> building .
one example we all know about is this cell phone . right ?
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and dignified way .
but it &apos;s happening everywhere , and these tools are parts of the ones that help us create .
seriously -- clap quiet -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you could think that that could be a big problem for a law , but the congress seems not to be very <unk> .
but if you build a lot of high-quality copies of light and selling copies , that &apos;s not okay .
some of the things we share , we &apos;ve done from things that we found , and we have every single option in that industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very elitist , crumbling , expensive education in india , and that was almost broken me .
and i thought , i start a barefoot college -- college just for the poor .
one professional is somebody , with a combination of competence , confidence and faith .
when i said that , they said , &quot; show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?
the entire current stream comes from the sun .
democracy , <unk> , how do you miss your land , what you should do if you &apos;re arrested what you should do if you &apos;re going to be a animal .
put it in there , you get the presence on the ground , you get between teachers and parents to <unk> , so the puppets of the teachers and the parents call out to the village and say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use sign .
i said , &quot; i can &apos;t , mr. president .
geert chatrou .
and our <unk> created one of the biggest , dynamically <unk> computers of the world for this kind of <unk> .
so what you &apos;re looking at here is the <unk> that we &apos;ve created as an artist for the scientists .
thank you very much .
and interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m feeling deeper , financially , emotional , mentally and in almost every other way . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t <unk> minute .
he didn &apos;t tell him the money , and of course , ray <unk> six months later the same idea .
in this case , because you &apos;re in the experiment that i &apos;ve been used to tell you about , monet prints from <unk> images .
we collected our materials , went from the room and waited half an hour .
i &apos;ll show you why .
it &apos;s two beautiful pictures , and now two beautiful <unk> calls for them , and we said , &quot; which of that would you go ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of <unk> <unk> , and they say , &quot; you know , we &apos;re giving a <unk> , and we can do it in two different ways .
<unk> , which is the great truck and the <unk> <unk> are beautiful .
voices : it flies into air . oh shit .
&quot; mommy , don &apos;t start ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not coming from the <unk> of <unk> , but on the road in a time , even before we put stories on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the kind of thing with the <unk> roof , you know .
and so we took my father his father , because i knew he would kill me if i left her alone , so we climb into the car .
&quot; and this guy had about a blue uniform , and a <unk> expression in his face ? &quot;
i really get stuck in ? because if i don &apos;t have a thread of thread to <unk> myself -- enough metaphors for your taste ? — it might be that i never come out again .
see ? we &apos;re a <unk> club with a secret <unk> .
she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to look ! &quot;
&quot; i agree for the little girl , old lady , damn . &quot;
it &apos;s gone from the car . &quot;
i have really big anxiety .
so what is the social result of that ?
where can i go to whom to whom ?
and if we have it , we &apos;re going to decide to decide about how many kilometers we &apos;re driving , where <unk> , where we live and work .
<unk> <unk> at the station , and you see exactly where you &apos;re running the bus straight and when it comes , and you can buy your tickets in real time .
i want to give you that we have a <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m assuming that this network of open standards should be available for everyone .
and they came here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who came with a mental illness , you know , what a challenge can do .
i said that i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to share with you the three a &apos;s , and i wanted to leave you with a <unk> .
because they all had three years old .
and so what i really love about this story is that rosey grier is a proper person , and that &apos;s about authenticity .
i had dinner with <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in clean hours .
j it &apos;s so many that the vision has become a little bit problematic .
i found it strange about it , as if it was a contest , about a fresh wound .
it &apos;s mostly a white , rich <unk> , which is not suited to the city .
it looks pretty simple , but that was a <unk> .
the people on two things -- they were astonished about destruction , but there was a sense of the <unk> of the new york of the new york that i found very interested in .
because when the four platforms along the <unk> -- which is an <unk> version of a <unk> -- we know that it had to be the test to react to the <unk> conditions and the changing definition of ground zero . . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
we have the opportunity to rethink our thinking about cities .
dr : i was an honor .
and i know that kids are suffering every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here and a concussion <unk> , most of us would be completely <unk> by several hours to several weeks .
you have to be familiar with the problems that we talk about today .
as it turns out , tom saw that a helmet for 20 dollars was a good opportunity to preserve a 100,000 <unk> .
it &apos;s not true , but it was happening tony blair during the davos forum in 2005 when his nobel complaint , of course , &quot; discovered &quot; and it was described .
in other words , they have a common and greater complexity of visual language that happens in <unk> sequence .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are dedicated to patents for drugs that have been at least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the vaccine to <unk> their patents and make them available for others .
in orlando , the same kind of stage , a <unk> . people were sitting in the <unk> sun , in very high humidity , and they didn &apos;t feel it .
they can adjust everything to worry for their well-being .
it offers all of these services , <unk> , tickets , and so little things that you do briefly online , but for people that it &apos;s going to connect to the digital world .
the question was , how do you make that teacher .
let &apos;s see what he does here .
and the husband of daughter , he was also sick by the exhaustion of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
now , <unk> had a <unk> on our studies .
now , when we feel emotion , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unfortunate people would occupy a different structural position within the network .
that &apos;s my favorite scenario . &quot;
they &apos;re both of carbon , and yet , one of them has one of the two <unk> in a special way , on the left , and they get <unk> , which is soft and dark .
so to give you something , let me give you a moment for a moment .
you can &apos;t just get to be easily .
among the same conditions , older people have their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more than negative information than negative .
we cost life .
and they &apos;d let me wish , &quot; tonight i &apos;m going to put these <unk> on this girl on this girl on this bar . &quot;
david david : so it &apos;s so i said , frankly , really , really , really knows what happens when i dance .
they have called me brother and uncles , and over a period of five years , over and over for a period of five years .
<unk> : the second treaty of fort laramie treaty clearly exceeds the <unk> of the great sioux nation and the <unk> of the lakota of the lakota black hills .
fort laramie fort laramie that at least three quarter of the <unk> sign to sign the country .
they were tired of distress .
the <unk> is eight times as high as the american average .
so what are we going to do ?
and today , child mortality rate since 1960 since 1960 percent .
you get it either as a pill or a syringe . you have to take it every day to regulate the <unk> .
if we do it , like here , with people to do ...
but basically it makes a lot of meaning .
it &apos;s : are they smarter than a <unk> ?
so bmw is a very safe car .
the problem for bmw is this car that &apos;s safe .
now , you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depended on it , i would like to use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect these with a scientific method .
that &apos;s something different than actually making an effective ad campaign .
what &apos;s new is not new .
the lights are going to be darker .
we do it for our client .
we have the sun in the sun .
now , logic -- some kind of logic , you know , you &apos;re going to get into that position here -- without moving the wrist .
i &apos;m going to intervene now . now , if every time ... another person -- not always the same answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;ll present a few <unk> .
here , i have to look at this from the beginning , so that i can follow my maps during the <unk> -- oh , we should start together -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : pardon ?
what are i going to use ? the queen or the five ?
lg : but you see the hand .
moment , moment -- take some card .
another color . lg : diamonds , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- all the maps -- there &apos;s all maps -- all the maps -- are you going to go to me ?
and last , the king -- in exactly five seconds .
some of you seem to know this child .
after i was going back , i was doing my entire company to a <unk> . &quot;
if you didn &apos;t have any speaker , you could not turn into the car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i always tell my students to say , &quot; if you &apos;ve got a deceptive ring , it &apos;s always a eyebrow , you see everyone . &quot;
imagine the person in front of you , and they follow the entire way from b to e and you will hear everything that was going to say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 , i was 45 years old , and i suddenly had a realization .
she came to auschwitz when she was 15 years old . her brother was eight , her parents lost her .
so , ladies and gentlemen from the jury , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , you &apos;ll get 20 dollars . &quot;
but for tasks of the 21st century , however , these <unk> , <unk> don &apos;t -- doesn &apos;t work and preserve mostly damage .
think of your own work .
the standard of living is lower .
these are the building blocks of a whole new <unk> for our business .
this one day <unk> autonomy has led to a whole series of <unk> that might have never happened .
make it because you like to make it .
this aluminum is used because of its light source .
in a series of 55 spheres , it &apos;s rotating , proportional , each ball , and their distances , are proportional to this little earth .
and the blue side , the <unk> , goes into the other direction .
it &apos;s evolved with the years into a lot of fakes .
the <unk> on the object would probably be an <unk> image of the earth .
but it always leaves those 10 percent or more , which are most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars and a club for <unk> dollars .
now , organizations don &apos;t have to go to bold , bold , big <unk> , new <unk> to try to get their call through the dirt .
so what should you do ?
now the overhead was now .
dan <unk> : why our thinking about charity is
and then there was the <unk> listeners , yeah , which was just that part of the music .
people that have done these <unk> , the <unk> , all of these beautiful instruments .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s only about the execution of the music as it is written , not about interpretation . &quot;
that &apos;s great . and what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he &apos;s doing .
you know , the authority is available if it &apos;s going to be used . that &apos;s very important .
so kleiber is about the process .
as a result , we tell ourselves a lot of stories about the future and about what steps we could do from here .
there are 98 patches around the world .
and in the face of climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that makes real pleasure .
it &apos;s about whether they should move it forward .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have transition <unk> , we would have to invent all of the nuclear facilities for the first time . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not balanced . and until a certain extent , exactly the games that they &apos;re playing for , the subject of so much , so that you can &apos;t see what &apos;s really quite obvious challenges .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that are not going to stand across that big challenge .
and even if you &apos;re just living , you could put money on it .
it should be more like private tuning .
but i had a <unk> when i went to <unk> <unk> , and i was on a <unk> in my life , and i was trying to decide to decide between music and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
many years after the solar-powered clocks , a young lady i knew that sex might be so good about the five senses .
it &apos;s all about <unk> , all of the five senses on a extreme level .
of course , the five senses are not the only thing that makes life interesting .
we &apos;re all born artists .
if you have a conversation , the child has to come up with the next answer to <unk> what it started .
but their parents will tell you , &quot; it &apos;s going to be all done by the waves . &quot;
but kids usually make art from fun . it &apos;s play .
but you rarely find a teacher .
in <unk> , there are always people who sing &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> &quot; or &quot; hotel <unk> . &quot;
in fact , in that minute , we can turn off the tv , <unk> them out of the internet , stand up and they start to do something .
the students don &apos;t fall into a kind of trance .
he said it &apos;s his profile . &quot; and what are you ? &quot; i asked . &quot;
let &apos;s start with how i came to that point .
it &apos;s going to be stronger storms and bigger flooding .
if you put it in the future , there will be a warming .
but that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s exactly the expectation .
the economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
a big part of the species will be threatens by extinction .
now , when a car accident happens , it &apos;s critical that we &apos;re not only serving the stuntman , but the crew .
something that was used to be used for as well . once it was all you had .
but today , we use a <unk> .
more is it , a <unk> <unk> .
in 1960 , joseph <unk> from the united states of the united states of titan was something very incredible .
one of the problems at that altitude , when you go to 10,000 meters -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 <unk> , you can really only use oxygen .
they created a puppet after him , which is what it looked like .
we expect and others would expect that maybe the players or the <unk> are going to say , &quot; you need to stick somebody into a suit that &apos;s not going to be <unk> with the plane . &quot;
there were three <unk> -- not true ? -- that was going through the conference , which is important to what i want to talk about .
and the girl replied , &quot; you know it . &quot;
the problem is an artist , as you &apos;re close . i &apos;m sure we &apos;re not going to grow into creativity , but we &apos;re going to grow out of it . or we &apos;re going to be more <unk> .
all around the world .
the whole system was invented -- all over the world there was no public education system before the 19th century .
the brain is not stored in areas .
they were ballet , they did <unk> and jazz , they danced modern and contemporary dances .
the festival went through like very good . with a <unk> press for whom you would die .
let &apos;s just say , &quot; value for <unk> . &quot;
dubai for me , for me , is to give you a hand of the <unk> of things .
before i get to the middle east , i want to end up with a quote from one of the biggest <unk> .
it &apos;s also the <unk> .
they &apos;re beautiful . they &apos;re disorders of behavior , and they are disorders of the mind .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools are going to be , or what we &apos;re going to have to be in in the isolated , to be able to be able to get to that , before the long behavior of behavior .
how are you going to increase it ? &quot;
the three are all the same , even though they &apos;re all the same in a lot of context , one is magical , the other two are like i like these books because they have something very special to themselves .
the children have taught them .
they were very friendly .
we also believe the content is more important .
i was changed through my children .
howard &apos;s doing this experiment , and when he gets the data , he &apos;s going to be a curve , and suddenly he recognizes that not beautiful <unk> .
this was his <unk> . he was obsessed with it .
howard don &apos;t always believe that there are these at all .
that &apos;s what people always say when you ask them how to wish their coffee .
a mustard with more elegance and culture and meaning .
so it was . and why are we liked to do that ?
he got a bunch of applause , and spent the majority of his career in the lower <unk> , and ended up in management . he became the general manager of &quot; oakland a &apos; . &quot;
we all know what happened when millions of women had gotten over decades of <unk> , until we got a huge trial from the national institutes , for sure , of the national institutes .
thank you .
but <unk> <unk> , and he didn &apos;t want us to do that .
but there &apos;s also an awful lot in between .
so , these are four really different ways of seeing the world . i &apos;ve named you .
what &apos;s interesting is , once you go to it -- and -- by the way -- this is by <unk> -- all of the artifacts of modern comics : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and that was what i proposed : we might be able to do comics on an infinite canvas : on the <unk> and on the y-axis and in <unk> .
this is by daniel <unk> <unk> in britain .
perhaps you &apos;ve been looking for a long time , but for me , so often i have seen exactly the same thing every day , i had never seen this <unk> <unk> challenge .
that &apos;s truth and sobering , and the reason that <unk> demonstrates is such an sustainable impression .
when you think your baby is gay , lesbian , you should give it to the adoption .
<unk> political solution was to pray the citizens of texas , to pray for rain .
this is called &quot; <unk> <unk> the sun . &quot;
i &apos;d like to start something different tonight , because i &apos;d like to leave you to go to the mainland and dive into the open ocean .
it &apos;s very soon after the vanishing route of dinosaurs , 65 million years ago than whales still had legs , and they <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to me .
and how do you make that ?
the <unk> <unk> takes the molas when they get into the bay , they put it in the bay , they put it in a kind of <unk> , and put them around .
i &apos;ll show you our last data points .
and what was most exciting about the most exciting thing is that all of their love and their interest in the oceans .
as you can see here , this is a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s what you don &apos;t hear every day .
<unk> <unk> .
in australia , it &apos;s mostly the clients that are sitting in jail .
she told him , and he <unk> the first <unk> of what we call the <unk> .
because there &apos;s no way that anyone gets a <unk> .
so why not make something about this problem in the everyday life ?
goodbye , <unk> .
could i get my last silence ?
never , that &apos;s impossible ! no , no , no ! that &apos;s not possible . &quot;
you could address the whole thing with the results .
from von neumann , a <unk> and a mathematician from the army all together , and then they needed a space to build them .
the <unk> and output worked first by <unk> .
&quot; uh-huh ! &quot; after that , she found that it was a <unk> .
i know if i have to pass myself . &quot;
and he &apos;d let the machine walk all night . if somebody reminded you stephen wolfram , who invented the whole thing .
now , 50 years later , we &apos;re going to be here -- it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> animation .
in the next 18 minutes , in the next 18 minutes , where i &apos;m talking here , four americans are still alive , dying , because of their diet .
that &apos;s a global problem .
<unk> city .
and he &apos;s got the snout of it . he &apos;s tired of his friends to have his family and his community .
they want ... they want to control themselves .
you know it &apos;s time for long , long time with this inner understanding of understanding .
we teach our kids .
and most kids get them .
okay , brown .
if you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
in all the united states , a lot of wonderful things , if we just look back now .
misha glenny : gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen -- an extraordinary group of politically <unk> hacker is the middle of 2011 .
the grid connects everything , and it &apos;s going to be very soon a lot of human activities .
in fact , <unk> uses its most efficient information , but not for financial profits . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
he explained to me how he was in 2003 and 2004 as he went in new york to tour , 10,000 dollars from the game here , 30,000 dollars out of the machines by using <unk> light .
he was born in <unk> in a stable and respect middle family , his obsession with play as an teenager led him to the <unk> .
and most of them , with exception of hemoglobin and <unk> , doesn &apos;t have any true social skills in the outside world -- just on the net .
i think there are many reasons . i &apos;m not going to go into the details , but some mention .
but they &apos;re all in the market . and what &apos;s driving the market is mostly -- number one is the big demographic <unk> .
we &apos;ve also found a lot of examples of dead large boxes that have been transformed in all kinds of social institutions , many churches , and many libraries , like this .
and finally , i would expect that the streets are going to be <unk> through the mall of the mall .
it &apos;s very successful . and it has been helped that eight of 13 bombs of <unk> <unk> <unk> plans in <unk> plans .
the stream was driven by the parking lot .
their inhabitants are different than a typical <unk> , but they &apos;re less <unk> than cities .
&quot; he said his vagina , &quot; she said , &quot; is a whole <unk> . &quot;
but in fact , it didn &apos;t work there with a woman with a woman .
it &apos;s about a gender that is a basic resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the way really exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning , our bodies <unk> on our heads -- that these separation have created a division , which is that the separation has created a division , which is often that <unk> .
i want to tell this little story about my own beginnings , because that &apos;s very much about happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s about my <unk> south carolina , which is not much smaller than today &apos;s h1n1 hungarians , and once upon a future country , as an african country .
well , maybe he was too quiet , because he stayed where he was , even long after it was <unk> through the nazis , and even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; bring me the best workers that you can find , and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;ll give you a . &quot;
and so it &apos;s very clear to us , &quot; it &apos;s all right . it &apos;s all that beautiful .
&quot; uh-huh ! &quot; said dr. robicsek . &quot; i went through the movie alone . &quot;
as i said , it &apos;s too much .
and you can actually imagine it .
you know what you &apos;re looking for .
but we &apos;re going to take care of the most difficult cases and get the others for the next day .
so we came to these two sets .
so i went to russia , and my mother went to the soviet union during the soviet union .
and when you think it &apos;s not going to be , you know , as long as you go further .
what i &apos;d like to try to do with that -- i hope to illustrate the dots .
and what i &apos;d like to point out later in the presentation is 50 percent of the u.s. &apos;s ocean .
it &apos;s <unk> because the photons can &apos;t reach the average depth of the ocean , which is <unk> miles . the <unk> is at 17,500 miles .
and so we went along the <unk> in an area next to the <unk> , and found the missing heat there .
so i started developing a new <unk> , with a <unk> that was replaced me , and i didn &apos;t have to go into my vehicle .
we &apos;re finding the status quo .
and i looked at her yesterday , she &apos;s in seattle . ok .
but i would leave a child without copyright control of my oil .
in some parts of the world , for example in south africa , education is hard to do .
when we looked at the impact of the <unk> , andrew and i decided that we had to increase so many people as we could offer to the best education .
what was the special thing to these courses ?
the video will be interrupted every few minutes and the students will ask a question .
so , we wanted to convince some of our colleagues in the humanities that several <unk> is not so bad .
in the terms of particular courses , you can ask yourself , which are the most <unk> , and how you can help the students to fix these .
we even see the beginning of either a personalized <unk> or through <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and about what my first thought was , what &apos;s scrotal when i was a child .
and of course , in our society , it &apos;s really about transforming other people &apos;s reality .
i &apos;ve got my doubt about the values of newton science , like , for instance , it &apos;s expected to be rational in a <unk> .
so , you can understand my surprise when i read in the new yorker , that alan greenspan , the head of the <unk> , says , ayn rand is his <unk> mentor .
i think you can do the funny thing that you have , not about the ones that don &apos;t have , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m not talking about kenneth <unk> and his charming <unk> .
i &apos;ve got this old time from the <unk> , which i tell you .
he said , i &apos;d have to give him more respect , because it can take to 18 years to be a good predictor .
what ? yes ? what ? i can &apos;t hear them . &quot;
and i fear that active person doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve been thinking about the <unk> thought about beauty that they &apos;re looking at us yesterday , and in his book , that trickster can sometimes create beauty . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
george w. bush : what the defense of our security costs also costs , and what the defense of our freedoms costs , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , there was no astronomer in the world on the idea -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
a lot of other ecosystems on earth are truly in danger .
he &apos;s constantly remembering that an experiment with a particle accelerator , and a bold trigger , could cause the world .
we have to have the same hide with the same hide as it is .
so , of course , we don &apos;t see .
what can we do about it ?
and now comes the worst thing .
we &apos;re using a lot of money on it , we &apos;re not going to die in a <unk> , but we &apos;re going to give it almost nothing . and yet it &apos;s totally preventable .
we don &apos;t want to be caught on the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to be .
this is very , very important , because this is the system , the <unk> of life on the planet , and it &apos;s time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing discovery . and we &apos;ve only been aware of it since recently .
and that &apos;s what the system represents , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
anybody who &apos;s going to come later , just put it on the database , and can the information that &apos;s going to be used for anything that &apos;s going on .
we &apos;re about trying to kill the wave , the technological possibilities .
in one earthquake , large amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the sea floor .
the <unk> john <unk> creates a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that have our oceans to global , interactive lab -- and there &apos;s a <unk> across the world of the deep sea .
that &apos;s why i think optimism is changing architecture .
so again , radical versus conservative .
the <unk> against the <unk> . you know , you want to understand everything you want to understand .
our intellectual leaders are complex .
you know it &apos;s true ; the cathedrals , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i &apos;m going to play something completely unfamiliar , and even with errors , instead of watching the same animal , it &apos;s going to be a result of its insignificance .
risks from rooms that were never as <unk> as they should be in a groundbreaking city .
there &apos;s the emotion of the victim .
daniel libeskind builds into very large ideas . it &apos;s called 17 thought of architecture -- ridiculous , hypotheses , <unk> , <unk> , radical -- and inspiration for each of the national creative pursuit . &quot; is it . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the cars of all the cars .
so , something like that , or will it just give it a few <unk> ?
em : it just needs to be . if not , we &apos;re in big trouble .
with this capital buys and statistical livermore <unk> on the roof , and then <unk> , or <unk> , a monthly <unk> <unk> , which is smaller than the average size .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve come across this 2008 .
it &apos;s like a jet jet .
how about everything in the world could be a person involved ?
look at this .
boy , if you look at our livestock , and you see a cheetahs as it eats one of our goats , it &apos;s very nervous . then go to him .
we were hungry .
our tradition looked like this : in each <unk> , there &apos;s an holy fire .
at the moment , we were dealing with support of the world wildlife fund , allowing the very little programs of <unk> .
it &apos;s very important -- we invest the money in enlightenment of aids and hiv .
<unk> -- over and over again , under many in the world of <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful way .
and we &apos;re hiding that price behind huge winning .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> takes the <unk> revolution for <unk> .
<unk> , clams , oysters , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- these were the known species .
that &apos;s like a <unk> of protein .
the science sees the world through the mind , quantitatively , things that can be measured and described , but they give art a frame of knowledge and knowledge .
so after three weeks after three weeks , after three weeks after three weeks .
that &apos;s the natural cycle .
that wouldn &apos;t usually do a <unk> photographer to <unk> a photo , right ? but sometimes it has to be to show the dimensions .
this is how the glacier &apos;s pulling back .
this one has seen several cameras .
could india be india or a global center for innovation , just as it has become a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
when we asked in conversation with the people in these <unk> , what they were working on , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
they can &apos;t be professor if they weren &apos;t a student .
the best hospitals , in the doctors for cancer , and at funerals , <unk> , heart disease , heart disease , <unk> at 4 a.m.
it works a little bit like -- this is a recent <unk> <unk> for four in the morning .
i said , i know a <unk> message when i see one .
every person in our society is dealing with cancer -- if not personal , by a beloved man , a family member , a friend , a friend .
this is the genetic material , the chromosomes , the chromosomes , inside a nucleus .
we &apos;ve applied tumor in the lab at over 20 different scales , and we see this effect on all of that .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in sixth of six month of tumor , and it starts secreting <unk> .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new blob , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re 15 feet deep , and collecting debt from the roof , there &apos;s a little pipe , and from their courtyard .
so , water from 300 , 400 miles away , it looks like this .
it &apos;s a stream , or a <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english we have <unk> and groundwater .
and they have to go even further .
these are the beautiful stairs we just saw on one of the images .
and <unk> are down 27 percent , 600,000 fewer people per year , hiv in sub-saharan africa .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in textiles , which get people out of the sand dunes and put them in direction to industrialization and prosperity .
and the countries on the right , you see the <unk> . in principle , each country with a top-down approach , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , we say three .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 60s , india didn &apos;t work that way .
you african products .
but i think a much larger problem with it is that these logic -- that we should <unk> ipods and not bombs -- i mean , it would give a great title for thomas <unk> new book .
and so , after all , there were 500 people , and four of them have been selected to go to the institution and put them on their own , and to go through it .
now , now , with people , to 2020 , is not going to change anything about it , because there are still the dictators that control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : do the internet <unk> worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was dealing with us younger fellows .
because for me , in that period of time , and in this <unk> , the question was , &quot; you want to ? &quot; you want to be ? &quot; or drugs -- and drugs we didn &apos;t know .
i was like paralyzed , people .
as indians , and politicians and <unk> , i &apos;m pretty much about the <unk> that affects our country , worried about india as a new <unk> , even the new superpower , even the new superpower .
in other words , all of us tell us all kinds of <unk> stories about countries , whether it &apos;s whether they want to get rid of the people who want them to come to daylight or not .
but the lightning bolt in our country was pretty slow down , it took about half an hour to this one call .
it can &apos;t understand the dialogues .
that sometimes can sometimes have consequences . ok .
and those of you who have taken your money back , you might be surprised to see how many <unk> are on the <unk> that explain the <unk> .
i went home , and i did a little bit of research , and i found some of the most scary statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a bath without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression comes from an critic , a early critic , and this is one passage that i just love , and i would like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing because if it would have been a problem : how do we get a problem : how do we get chimpanzees in the world ?
that &apos;s the hardest part that &apos;s not obvious , and that &apos;s why i &apos;ve picked it up for the end .
ok ? stop . that &apos;s right now .
i don &apos;t know why <unk> are <unk> , but no matter , you &apos;re in the garden .
thanks , thanks , thank you .
i actually suspect that the <unk> probably is probably a lot of reasons why we want to do new things very , very quickly .
it &apos;s going to look like this . you should see something like this .
many mckim have a different one -- another version of this exercise was done in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s .
and we &apos;ve learned that with time : you get a much better brainstorming , much more creative outcomes , if everyone thinks to the rules .
and all of a sudden , there was an incredible conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , i &apos;ll come back to that .
you know how it feels , all of these uncertainty , as long as you go back in the corridor , while the doctors are in one of the <unk> in one of the <unk> , and you ask yourself what &apos;s going on here .
and that would make all of us feel secure and have a good time because we agreed with the rules and agreed .
we do everything that leads to success . but then , when we got there , we think we &apos;ve done it . we neglect that we &apos;re going to be able to do it , and just stop doing all that what we successfully successfully done successfully .
i was faster , but even depressed .
i &apos;ve learned that success is not an one-way .
and the <unk> is just full of hotter girls . &quot;
i said , &quot; oh my god , &quot; hopefully , for always , the last time in public .
it made sure all fit .
it was about 900 people participating in it .
and the second thing is , people are experiencing a direct connection .
these are questions .
as you can see in modern liberal democracies , society , the society that doesn &apos;t just give us our own self to shape our self , but to do it by us .
it means that we satisfy our full potential as human beings .
so these are the layers , the kinds of questions that i wanted to conduct you today -- the question : what are the intentions that come to use , if you design something ?
so i said , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> tells us that there must be better ways .
and we succeeded .
i &apos;ll give you a fall .
he <unk> them into the right position , <unk> them with his nose and beating .
we found the first surprise .
there had to be any kind of <unk> to create the observing amount of force and the speed we observe and the <unk> of the system .
one load measures forces , and that &apos;s actually a <unk> load with a crystal inside .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the heel , and that &apos;s going to be <unk> and hitting the load load .
a very , very <unk> solution for the particular problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , stupid , it &apos;s ocean .
i think that &apos;s one of the most beautiful classic ekman records ever built .
i don &apos;t know other <unk> , not even <unk> , just benefit that this is an infinite space .
now look at this -- it just leaves me .
the submarine , which was out last year , is this one .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as <unk> , <unk> , -- please , please , if you give you the obvious example -- is not the right approach that we need to vote .
in fact , new york city was being built on the back of the boat , our roads across their shells .
in these eight <unk> segments little <unk> , they &apos;re going to be virtually <unk> .
so you go to london around , and it was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
finally , agriculture created a map of discovery .
and that happens every second week .
i was taking her portrait on the top of the <unk> .
and in this area of the amazon , the oil was discovered .
the other side of the aral sea is torah , where you &apos;re supposed to stop osama bin laden . that &apos;s <unk> .
this was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me move you through the hubble <unk> field of field .
but then you go to jupiter , and it &apos;s 40 minutes . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be part of the universe in which it &apos;s about understanding of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so the stuff that translates inside the picture is , dark matter .
when you saw this image for the first time , you haven &apos;t seen a lot in it .
this is where it was done with 1,000 processors for a month , just to make this visible here .
with <unk> , we &apos;re keeping a resolution which is about this image of the earth , where you can see the complicated pattern of earth .
and in fact , we are stressed out of course .
forty-seven percent .
that &apos;s crazy . we do that all the time .
i got into a vicious cycle , which led to many pain and problems with the joints , so that i could almost nothing .
i asked myself to be creative , could you be creative , if you look for the restrictions ?
the whole thing happened not from today .
the continuous wear of <unk> is obligatory , as well as a <unk> <unk> . there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> monitor .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , killed millions of <unk> . in the &apos; 40s , they looked across the nazis , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . many of the women were at the time after germany .
that &apos;s what causes the grief to be . &quot;
and as an <unk> inspired , the notion that we had learned what we had learned in the virtual world , and we could use our identity , to live a better life in the real world .
we &apos;re getting ourselves to a new way of being together .
human relationships are secret , chaotic and <unk> .
it <unk> them .
because at the moment when people are alone , even for a few seconds , they become <unk> , senior , get panic , they <unk> after an electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in truth , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have the <unk> that had predicted some of our students , and quite often -- -- quite often , i felt that they had a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of <unk> .
perhaps because my father had always been read for my father .
so i left them in silence -- but <unk> and <unk> had to be them .
and i thought to myself , i thought to myself a pyramid , but i don &apos;t have the time to go beyond that .
even though you lose that , not fear of failure , if we gave it all the time , because who can make it more desire than giving them all the way it &apos;s going to be .
if i should call it names , i never know it .
do i have enough <unk> ?
the second challenge would be cells .
today in many clinical trials are actually trying to use different kinds of stem cells for heart disease .
it &apos;s only last month that we &apos;ve succeeded with this technology , which is to show human rights vision .
we can then put them together and put them on a few degrees , and put the kidney into all their <unk> properties , and then we can just take that information and then print that information .
i couldn &apos;t go to school . i just got it dirty .
i was a child , i said , &quot; yes , i want to do that . i want to do this surgery .
you might have noticed that a new field is called the <unk> .
and connected to these <unk> , there were examples around the world -- from the choice of a president to the <unk> wikipedia and everything that was in between -- the showed what the power of a lot could do .
third , <unk> , <unk> environmental issues .
because what you need , that &apos;s the hole , not the drill .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want the music that plays them .
my name is joseph and bin laden in kenya .
we have to <unk> our women and children , we need to run . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to make the infrastructure .
late night , i went home to the batteries and the ice .
together : did somebody <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country , put the master in moscow , and in part of it , to do this .
that can be huge spending , but if the city can extract a number of x volunteers for y hours , depending on the <unk> of the city of the city .
they have <unk> , spreadsheets and data .
so , in the 18 minutes that i &apos;ve been licensed to talk to here , between two and <unk> people that are going to be in cities .
and he was in a <unk> <unk> mud .
the buildings here have several stories .
these green things are done in the foreground .
and when you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true that dream .
think about it . these guys who didn &apos;t have the same league as i was , helped me through their high support , <unk> reading in death .
at the time , <unk> usually worked with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , he could develop a machine that could read each <unk> .
but you know , i think it &apos;s very lonely to read by machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to transport these books across the border , in the different charged countries , the u.k. , united states , united states , canada , australia , and new zealand , all different <unk> of harry potter .
it &apos;s more than doubled , since <unk> , it has more than doubled , and it &apos;s increasing about one speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . how do you ask people like me , ok ?
secondly , the new dictionary is a good news , because as soon as the 42 work takes , we &apos;re not going to have to do that , and we &apos;ve got to do that , and we &apos;re going to have to do it .
the societal challenges of these inequality should be addressed .
the economic playbook are surprisingly clear , and surprising is very surprising , especially in perspective .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world with cutting-edge technologies embedded into a slightly more dignified society and forward by a economy that inequality rather than promote choices . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
in the course of the year , i started to feel more popular with this notion of god .
some of them have shown that we can only believe in a god that divides our pain .
the second one is , &quot; wind and waves obey him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big operator or <unk> ?
the virtual soul of the universe .
by looking at the god inside , by looking at my own <unk> .
one of the first things i started studying was the story of the <unk> &quot; technique . &quot;
we &apos;ve found no <unk> that were older than 40 years , and the average age of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 to 30 .
your body has been used to this new food .
so , this equality of energy and matter that has shown the einstein , and the modern science of <unk> shows , entropy and information and matter and matter and energy all together , so it &apos;s a long continuum .
this is a robot that wants to plug his own transformation to get more power .
and what i mean by that is we &apos;re looking for her a new job .
now , a great development that began billions of years ago by us and continues , and our choice is kind of in technology , it &apos;s really at us with that force that &apos;s much more powerful than ourselves .
and they said , &quot; well , we have five classes 30 to 40 students .
we demolished it down , and we found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it had this -- as we said , somebody said , &quot; you know what , it looks like the arch of a ship . &quot;
so we waited , we sat at the table , and we waited .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> . the only problem , especially for adults who really knew nothing really knew when they started , is that there was only one toilet .
the teachers we work with -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what to do .
it &apos;s about 170 boys have worked with them on the book , and this is how wonderful works .
and right there -- there &apos;s usually a little chain -- right behind them , they saw how kids were taught .
there &apos;s also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re in <unk> , but it opens up slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he brings his girlfriend .
he &apos;ll give him an email , he &apos;ll answer you every question that you can imagine .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side , who thinks that peace is the end of the peace , and there &apos;s one side that thinks that science is the creation of schools and practical .
she sent her kids to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one , which is the manual for complete <unk> , did you know that ?
on cape cod , there are <unk> roads , and we can all stand here .
that &apos;s my baby . thank you very much .
he said , &quot; i &apos;ve designed everything . &quot;
and in some sense , i &apos;ve always felt badly .
so i looked at this kind of complications .
i found that cheetos are very good <unk> .
the school is most of the time , so number 10 difficult .
in fact , in a strange <unk> of <unk> , which is about a window to the moment where the road had been <unk> in front of my house , and this <unk> <unk> <unk> there in the sun .
and i was reminded of the excellent presentation of karen armstrong reminded that religion really doesn &apos;t really understand , but to do with behavior .
the <unk> has seen geographically , the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s got exactly the same size as the united states , <unk> of a field , which is about the size of arizona .
but it &apos;s not just the developed environment .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , the australia to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation of the brain tissue that we own from the presumption of this challenge .
now , before i show you a few pictures of the preview , i want to point out on this beautiful detail about <unk> and design .
now , this is actually an extraordinary school in this .
we have discussed today with a keith <unk> that many scientists have not tend to show a little bit of beauty in their talks , from fear to be seen as stupid members of being a stupid <unk> . . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ;
now , here &apos;s examples that you can actually print in 3d printing , which is very interesting .
so , that allows us to think about what robots means to us .
no . so i had to think a little sharper .
we did the same for iraq .
that was a challenge we had as a physicist .
we can push it high . the forces are more . there are more of them , but they are weaker .
&quot; <unk> 7 &quot; <unk> . a whole band .
and there are a couple of employees in foundations that call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the idea of justice , which of our lives , and gives us a sense of what &apos;s true in life , which is true in life , what we should do , social justice .
and as it is , he <unk> during the <unk> .
so every week , you know , the <unk> arrived . &quot; god , you &apos;ve heard me again . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , a infection , a inflammation or an operation .
the muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- <unk> call like that .
we &apos;re treating them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- that , frankly , in this kind of pain , not very effective .
now you get to get a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about .
it was 1908 . it &apos;s nothing . so i can live .
i don &apos;t know if you can see him out of the back of the back , and these are just stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a probe called deep impact , which is one of them in the nucleus of a comet .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is we can have a <unk> and we can change , and we can change our future .
at that time , i was running <unk> , the only independent system to be precise , the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought business was going to survive and be a great company , if <unk> was going to be gone , which turned out to be right .
and at the end of the day , he says , look , it &apos;s not going to work , you &apos;ll never see your money , but my foundation will put 50,000 dollars on the table so you can test the idea .
and we said , well , that -- that &apos;s okay , we &apos;re meeting , you &apos;re going to give us your own business of what you actually did .
you see , we &apos;ve got in private training and we started working with our work and we went to russia .
and after a while , we opened up a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve developed the idea of scale , of course , of the free press .
and in this way , you organized the funding , so there &apos;s no <unk> , no more blind ones to find yourself .
so why does that work ? that &apos;s the question .
now , some call it a theory of everything .
one simple example is this : newton found the law of gravity , which operates like one divided by the square of the rectangle between the <unk> of each other .
the more symmetry you have , the better you get the simplicity and elegance of theory .
one thing that he thought was most of us as granted today , but at its time it didn &apos;t happen .
it doesn &apos;t <unk> the meaning of these <unk> that they follow <unk> law , and they &apos;re going to follow .
but he was reading in every free moment he had , books .
from that ambition , he went back into the <unk> .
but when he was starting to put his signature under the <unk> , his hand was deaf and grace , because he had a thousand hands on the morning .
not very surprising -- there were only three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , the older i got , the more i understand , what an incredible privilege was , with this aging lions of a man &apos;s so many hours .
and so , as lincoln said the story , it went to the war after britain .
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we only do ? &quot;
what &apos;s the reason for that is that i &apos;m always grateful for this strange love of history that allows me to spend a life in retrospect to the past .
he had the temple <unk> and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is evidence that the jewish person in babylon , after the entire years , that they sat in babylon to the rivers , and at the memory of jerusalem , that these children would be going home .
all of these are being respected by cyrus .
the <unk> cylinder is from the priests of the great <unk> of babylon , marduk , writing .
you all know what &apos;s happened .
to see this object in tehran , thousands of living in iran &apos;s jewish jewish jewish .
some people know more about it , but they still think they &apos;re a <unk> bad .
the <unk> babies in the first few hours , in the first few hours , but their needs didn &apos;t succeed , and sometime in , they were not going to strive , within a few days , they were <unk> , <unk> and <unk> in air , like everyone else .
one trial shows that 10 percent of the average cost is about 30 percent of the cost of labor , as oil prices cost about 30 percent .
and that fascinated me , because i spent my entire life in front of a camera .
you know very quickly what you have to do to find an answer .
it was <unk> people -- most of these friends and family .
we &apos;ve listened to each other .
but of course , he never came . the explanation has never happened .
and after many , many meetings , i was thrilled that this man , <unk> <unk> , was really one of my heroes and mentors , and he managed to take care of the boat .
so he said , well , we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in peace and his possibility , etc . , etc . , and they were going to be a reality .
we &apos;re connected with <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> . i said , &quot; in london , it &apos;s about truce .
it &apos;s about their <unk> to make their business .
the biggest brains of the world should also be <unk> .
i &apos;m going to go to the <unk> of this number , but i could never find them .
it &apos;s just a big fibroid .
and remarkably , that &apos;s exactly what our ancestors might have invented about 1.5 million years ago when they discovered cooking .
it &apos;s very simple absurd for the <unk> conversations that i took .
and i think i just stand at the beginning .
but once the fight expands , the physical rehabilitation was exposed to the physical rehabilitation .
he was a child , his son , red in his face to live his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
i was talking to my bosses in the headquarters , and i told them -- i said -- i said , &quot; look , we start with a few hours a day , just for some repairs . &quot;
two groups of <unk> began to fight .
so i asked him , &quot; what &apos;s it about ? &quot;
&quot; but yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not only in the orthopedic department , but in the houses in people &apos;s houses .
and you should see me during a <unk> .
and that hospital could have been able to afford <unk> .
why ? because the path i took was ever since .
but i learned a little bit more striking than that , which is that the leaders -- the managers of the economy -- hugely bad choices that have been our economy just in front of the collapse .
because i knew the state of the african continent were going to be important for my children and their children .
i &apos;m trying to do the experience i had in swarthmore to bring to africa .
isn &apos;t my time ? ok .
we &apos;ve reached a moment where a great society can turn into a generation .
you &apos;ll notice that he &apos;s very excited by the <unk> yellow ball -- the sun we draw as children .
in fact , that &apos;s something that half of them , more than half of them , are not going to be familiar .
<unk> &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
<unk> probably . &quot;
and that &apos;s the messages you convey them ?
because , in the end , the sponsors love it , and so it &apos;s going to put them all on tv .
it &apos;s a professional <unk> that speaks to dead , she &apos;s not going to get rid of me ?
what is socialization ?
we &apos;d like to put suggestions on people how to avoid <unk> and <unk> and chinese authorities , so that they make something .
thank you .
that &apos;s why the entire hospital is just about a generator .
it has to give something better . &quot;
but you can control the user , whether it &apos;s just power or not , because you can control the <unk> on the ground , how much percent oxygen is giving you your patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most effective and portable device that we can put in hospitals .
the different kinds of writing in africa , the first one was <unk> , like the typeface <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society of the <unk> in <unk> .
but until 1998 , when a <unk> named john <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , centuries of mesopotamia . <unk> <unk> , centuries before teapots . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
almost a fifth of greenhouse gases comes out of poverty -- that &apos;s more than the traffic .
not bad .
i like animals , and the shops to <unk> and animals on the assembly line like tools are not just fine .
<unk> was a complete french .
a picture of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t very bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would think that maybe that might not be that bad .
so one year ago , i asked myself a question , &quot; why am i , even though i know what i know , no vegetarian ? &quot;
on weekends , you have the choice .
you can make a picture with a iphone and all names , even though it makes mistakes even mistake .
she &apos;s going to be distracted . he wins that race .
you can &apos;t see it because it &apos;s too big .
you would think it &apos;s about interest , more than that , when the stakes are so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a big piece of art .
the human nature needs to change .
but part of the reason -- and that &apos;s why we have a ethical plane in the lifestyle -- is they &apos;re also intrinsic value .
it could be more complicated in humans , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it totalitarian to play with these forces ?
and so i knew that i needed something to the remote control .
so there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s <unk> , there &apos;s the dynamic behavior of fluid .
and so i think that you can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we &apos;re taking the pizza , our very first pizza , and measured the individual slices , as the messenger in the corridor and <unk> us .
i was certainly 20 before i first went to a art museum .
i thought to myself , okay , you &apos;ve got a few criteria how you want to pick the works .
it &apos;s not a photoshop work .
they were interested in creating alternatives to create alternatives , and they needed money for it , so they decided to make some interesting useful projects .
this project is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave and we did this , it was hilarious -- the attention we got .
and she describes how the <unk> -- all you say is like , because of the <unk> woods .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of the user , and he &apos;s also an artist .
it &apos;s going to be origami with origami . so .
so instead of making mathematical principles , to understand the underlying principles .
or they put it on the top , and 50 stars on a flag with 13 stripes .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules that you find circles , you covered the <unk> with lines , the added rules . it makes the crease pattern .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to make it bigger , you might need something origami .
and that doesn &apos;t work whether you go into space or you go into a body .
i grew up in a <unk> state in the state of washington with a lot of time .
we only have three minutes . but we &apos;re talking about hours for hours .
and so i want to talk about that , because if we don &apos;t acknowledge it , it &apos;s going to be very painful .
and in a moment i &apos;ll show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the graph -- it begins in 1973 , just before the women start to <unk> , and it goes on to the next day .
you have facilities from above .
because i write about all this a book , i still surf , and i don &apos;t have any answer .
and that was very disheartening for them .
since we don &apos;t have this information yet , you get back to us in the form of pop culture , in this awkward and a little way , where you can see that it &apos;s going to change .
there &apos;s no man or a woman who &apos;s standing in the middle , and there &apos;s the wires .
whereas personal incomes on a scale that was being kept , to protect the inflation , in that time , more than doubled , has nearly tripled .
and to listen to me and understand what i say , you know about 60 bits per second .
so , it &apos;s going to happen , so in the last book of me called &quot; good business , &quot; i &apos;ve interviewed some ceo from your environment as very successful and very ethical <unk> , with great social disparities .
control is always a safe thing , because you feel it , but not very close .
&quot; where are you born and grew up to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own purpose of what home is . they had their meaning of community , and even for hostility , which was taken by birth of birth . they didn &apos;t really have the opportunity to go beyond that .
more and more people are in the future or present , as well as in the past .
i went down into the room that i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where are you home ?
there was a big gap between one billion in the developed world , and the two billion in the developing world .
but that &apos;s the world we have today . no more gap .
and let me show you why , to the <unk> , digital technology .
the children survive is the new green .
and again , they were better than we were , &quot; your brits and your mortality at heart disease is shocking . &quot;
but if you give people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i immediately started working with <unk> , let them grow , and then i worked with <unk> -- mice that could not produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my mother-in-law , and of course i don &apos;t know how old she is .
in the summer , you &apos;re going to be in the equator as well .
it &apos;s a lot of progress , a lot of <unk> lives .
that &apos;s actually real photography , in six days , showing that the limb within a few days .
and here you see on the right , which is six months later , the technically needs <unk> .
a vertical-takeoff aircraft is made of two different types .
we put it back into this oven-like device .
there &apos;s a lot more participatory organs . with distance the most complex organs that are highly enriched , with each amount of <unk> organs like heart , liver and kidneys .
this is still in <unk> .
we prefer cells that aren &apos;t going to be sustained and no tumors .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem out there , anyone would have an idea .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m a little bit of panicked -- unlike all the furniture and sugar that i had -- but this is really creepy for an entrepreneur .
that doesn &apos;t mean you need to go to a <unk> .
i went to door to door , and i sold .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there &apos;s a recession .
and you would do that chairs .
that &apos;s pointless . you &apos;ve got to find a way to get faster to money .
i sold a lot of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get a regular income , but they have the possibility to find more tasks , and they learn to learn the ability of learning , and they also learn the ability to find other possibilities .
when you go into a restaurant and you &apos;re going to be badly , you show them how bad <unk> looks like .
these boys , special .
the evolution of the today is to throw all of the interests out of it .
the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> of cultural <unk> , is raising the majority of our students .
the values of the past are also resuscitated . that &apos;s all a lot of society .
but it &apos;s a policy of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a spirit . and they have other people .
what should we address if we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- this is what it &apos;s about : you go to the church .
sure , i know you don &apos;t really believe that .
and that doesn &apos;t just happen to another result , it has the potential to change how we interact with each other .
it &apos;s different .
in fact , that &apos;s not a proper organization , but clear -- let me close that -- creative commons gives you a simple way to put your content on the liberties of the freedoms that you want to leave you with .
john mccain .
and i wonder how often that happens .
he told me that he was the <unk> <unk> and then , &quot; there &apos;s a snake in the next room , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i took them through this process and show them what this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general electric were also happy .
i just survived , only so we understand ourselves .
i &apos;ll be asked by people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to our advantage ? &quot;
another possibility of how microbes can spread through the people . architects would like to look through the human interaction , and to promote the smallest interaction or the exchange of ideas in example , labs and offices .
imagine a design called microbes , like in the airplane or on a telephone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple macintosh .
in 2010 , his essay was rejected by the <unk> .
and greenpeace wanted to do this . and a method that was going to achieve that , at one of these humpback whales , a <unk> <unk> .
to 78 percent of voices . to give you a notion of the <unk> victory : two in the <unk> , in the <unk> , is only three percent .
and the last message i &apos;d like to tell you is : you can be totally successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain , which is a great privilege to stand in front of you today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are synesthetic .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a very good way to be the <unk> ahead of what &apos;s going to be done to make the science tomorrow .
you have the color red and color , you &apos;re facing the edge of change from day to night .
voice : why not ? this is a very good piece .
that &apos;s an illusion .
so this is china , a civilization-state , and not as much as a nation-state .
but you can &apos;t take a country like china is a civilization-state , on the ground of &quot; a civilization , &quot; a system .
and the reason for that is , the state in china gets a very special -- it &apos;s very special than the representative , the embodiment and the <unk> of chinese civilization , the <unk> .
it was 60 kilometers long , connected beijing with <unk> and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen that in terms of the <unk> -- which is the position of <unk> <unk> -- or the <unk> .
it &apos;s going down a road on rail in the suburb , and the cars go down .
red 1 = blue , <unk> blue = <unk> squared = <unk> &apos;s orange = <unk> .
and the first song was in english , the second one was on chinese .
she agreed to her song .
i was making graffiti , writing my name , using the city as canvas .
i mean , that was the faces of my friends .
they all accepted that their image is going to be next to each other .
&quot; you mean , you know a computer-generated face -- that &apos;s a <unk> , right ? &quot;
most of the places i went to do , i decided to go through it because i heard about them in the media .
i took more pictures , and we launched the project .
do you have a ngo ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were located , <unk> a woman , &quot; now i can see god . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there are layers behind each photo .
but they basically took me a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
when i think about the networking and what you tick , why it &apos;s now going to happen , i think , there are a couple of factors i want to give you as a <unk> .
they triggered a trend .
we started a decade ago , in 2000 .
it &apos;s demand to participation . cities have been welcome to participation .
it &apos;s very affordable , and it &apos;s very &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the last 40 years was extraordinary times .
it also has miniaturization .
that would take a surprisingly <unk> settlement .
it &apos;s vital that at ted <unk> ideas , ideas that we think about , it &apos;s going to be a particularly <unk> century , and not one of the <unk> and <unk> .
my late family are boring teachers that are concerned with the <unk> planetarium from the <unk> to our own <unk> . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime prime minister . &quot;
i thought it would be crazy , but something that was really attached to it .
i was sitting , like you here , in the audience .
this is another image .
since then , my career <unk> , i got a lot of success .
i started studying the <unk> <unk> of the human psyche .
this time , i said , let &apos;s try something different .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein is very honored to be here at ted 2006 between all the today . in fact , she &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous when you would fall .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have trouble . you have the problem , remember you ?
sw : big finish .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents found that important for their intrinsic lung .
when i have a talent , it &apos;s kind of making things apart from which i have <unk> <unk> .
the body has a higher density than the water . at least 95 percent of the body is born by itself .
and this is going to bring them very far .
i asked him what that means .
at that point , you can look at , if you want to get multiple languages , and you can see them without each other .
and she looked up to me and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s really better . &quot;
i think you agree to me that they look very well .
and having spent a lot of tests about 50,000 students , so roughly a half a dozen schools , my readers , by the way .
we found out -- and we were doing quite a lot of things wrong and improved , but we found that the young people loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a little introduction to the <unk>
and finally , the only person , the nurse , a young shepherd , and he goes to saul and says , &quot; i &apos;ll fight him . &quot;
it &apos;s the cavalry , men on horses and with <unk> .
goliath is light prey . it &apos;s got no chance .
so goliath is to be <unk> than <unk> at the time , and usually there &apos;s an explanation for that when somebody is so far outside of the norm .
and i think it &apos;s a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out we &apos;re covered by a <unk> , and these microbes are actually doing very well , rather than killing us .
they have used all the microbes and they reassemble the ileum in the recipient .
most pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , one or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species of species .
we need a <unk> for the microbes that live in and on people so that we can understand what &apos;s going to do to our lives .
there &apos;s a lot of people thinking about the internet on the internet , but for us , it &apos;s truly global . we have in many , many languages .
when you saw him earlier a ridiculous change on the side of me , they thought that this was just going to be <unk> in <unk> .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , so we don &apos;t talk much about truth and objectivity .
and we have over 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not a perfect rule , but it &apos;s very important for the beginning .
and i always like to say that they &apos;re also the only person that actually knows all the rules of wikipedia , about ...
it seems to me as though most of the textbooks that are used to the children of our children from nature .
in the jungles of guatemala , in <unk> , there &apos;s a temple .
there &apos;s a <unk> indian indians in <unk> , which is a missionary in <unk> , and here it is .
it &apos;s far below your cognitive <unk> .
we found activity in other forms of activity -- in <unk> , with the computation of profits and loss .
i have a friend who &apos;s just <unk> a terrible <unk> .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we turn to each other and think of our glances , &quot; <unk> &quot; and we &apos;re talking .
tools like <unk> , knives , <unk> , or <unk> , which i was in a towel .
i &apos;d been searching for a long time , but never looked at my closeness .
in some <unk> , they put tools in a few laps , about sponges to the <unk> .
so you can <unk> and get rid of the distance out of the distance .
look at how you open your partner and the other <unk> .
but what we found was , though , fast dolphins don &apos;t just depend on a boat at a keyboard .
this dolphin we called &quot; <unk> , &quot; because she &apos;s about 12 <unk> .
but as we decode their natural sounds , we &apos;re also planning to bring these back into the computational system .
and the word is invented .
there &apos;s yves rossy .
and especially when you &apos;re in the <unk> , you have the feeling .
yr : i &apos;m just trying to be fit .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been used for the last 15 years -- never with this kind of wings , but at the beginning .
we don &apos;t tell your employer .
but it was up to <unk> and full of <unk> .
now , the way of thinking about it , what you saw , is through invisible forces .
because this event was the scientific revolution since that our knowledge of the physical world , and how we could adapt it to our needs , <unk> in the growing .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
they &apos;re clinging to guesses ; our on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a <unk> story .
and only when an explanation is good , it &apos;s important that you can check it .
spiders are not very expensive . it &apos;s pretty clear .
it &apos;s about 30,000 of them .
what is minto for a place ?
the new festival are leading the audience to play a crucial role in the design of performance . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
she had met with others to look at &quot; the sultan &apos;s elephant , &quot; and that &apos;s all done well . &quot;
&quot; no <unk> , that &apos;s good . &quot; first doctor : &quot; is you dizzy ? &quot;
i thought my career was over .
this is a bear that i was looking at for a while .
this is a piece of <unk> ice , it &apos;s 12 years old .
i &apos;m going to show you now pictures of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> and leopard seals and leopard seals , but this picture is more than any other i &apos;ve ever done .
people said , &quot; we knew they were malignant . we knew it . &quot;
and these seal took off the penguin and they threw it back and forth .
she swam away . she started a penguin .
she was trying to <unk> my camera , which is the dream of any architect .
paul <unk> : stories from a <unk> <unk>
open your eyes now .
do you have a ring ?
and they &apos;re focusing on this task .
joe , we &apos;re doing it so long until you get tired of it .
funny , yeah , we have a little man , a <unk> , operates up the whole day up there .
as i said , you get your reality .
and so we were working together to build ushahidi and build and build .
a call in the united states , to canada or china costs five <unk> , or <unk> u.s. dollars .
it &apos;s built to be <unk> , so you can also be able to have a <unk> and so you can get through remote places .
over time , the buildings were going to higher and better our technology always , so that the mechanical systems were huge , they need great amounts of energy .
now , imagine , two americans travel through italy .
please raise your hand , all of you who are familiar with this as liberal .
the best definition of what i know -- she explains so much -- comes from <unk> gary marcus .
he leaves us very , very old <unk> .
but look at the other three lines .
aren &apos;t that just the foundations of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
she went up and continued to go .
and you say , &quot; hey your laws from my body . &quot;
and we have the signs of <unk> to the right , <unk> is the liberal god -- and both work together .
and so the answer to the truth , i think , to use these passionate dedication to the truth and try to transform them into a better future for all of us .
but if you react , a lot of other people in the environment that are innocent , but also might be hurt -- the military doesn &apos;t want to talk about <unk> .
we look at something else , &quot; and realized that the situations were actually quite amazing .
is someone going to be a part of how many times when you think of how it was introduced , how often the police in queensland would appear to be in queensland ?
there were only a few people who had been shot at this incident .
it &apos;s 72 and it looks like this is the most efficient way to cope with it .
and if you look at them , people will give bed together , but they don &apos;t have to do a <unk> damage . &quot;
we have started to organize makers with our maker &quot; maker days . &quot;
<unk> , white billy , or something like that .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about it , but just ...
but he also moved here for other people who did the same as he did .
that &apos;s &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we need to put that into the schools , or to the communities , many ways the ability to build , the world to shape and shape the world .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we &apos;re seeing these <unk> pictures of stars all the time -- you call it <unk> .
it &apos;s not about one way , but you have to imagine your world .
looking at a <unk> winds , are glamorous .
but it &apos;s going to always tell you that if you buy that lamp , you &apos;re going to live in a world without wires .
the perfect <unk> -- symbolizes through the perfect chain , with the perfect <unk> .
because glamour can be very <unk> and enduring .
but i also knew how hard she worked for all week .
i did this from a lot of strangers .
i heard of women who were fed up in their beds , or <unk> in their <unk> , like dead left on parking , with acid burned into their <unk> .
then i got cancer -- or i found that i had cancer .
my girlfriend was making this big bowl , and i asked them , &quot; what &apos;s that ? &quot;
it was <unk> friends and a loving sister .
because we all are so badly <unk> to imagine the interior of our human beings and their secret intentions . &quot;
kids need a long time to do the system .
rs : <unk> . -- now , joshua go to drink himself .
rs : should ivan get some anger ?
and you have it in the coffee of your girlfriend .
now , first of all , i &apos;ll prove to you that it &apos;s a <unk> .
please tell me that they don &apos;t <unk> , if , let &apos;s say , the pentagon that &apos;s going to quit .
but why do you have to feel something ?
and it was , you know , a course for <unk> .
and secondly , it &apos;s possible to be able to slow down at all , to slow down ?
they want to go back to a narrow rhythm .
and norway , sweden and finland , are under the six <unk> nations in the world and working hours where the average american would be <unk> .
but the new idea , the revolutionary idea of <unk> is that it &apos;s kind of like &quot; good slow . &quot;
i &apos;m sure the <unk> is like a <unk> task on my <unk> , it was told to me because they were so slow to be so slow , and i was going to be done very quickly .
and so it took all his start , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build anything on an island ; some of it has to stay on the shore , because we don &apos;t want to be on the community . &quot;
i was working on it , and i didn &apos;t work with it because i felt that people who came out of the historic museum , already with the information , and if you can see a museum of information , you wouldn &apos;t be able to process that .
when i flew home , the <unk> was planned .
but you see the uniqueness of the environment .
stephen rise : the building of happiness on the building of the uniqueness of the uniqueness of a few of the things that &apos;s done by the last few of the city . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and when christian was a note -- game for example is an f.
so , in jazz , the <unk> is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about taking my vision or something like that .
am i ? pretend to you ?
they had to get a lot of <unk> to get here .
in the summer , india is going to be extremely hot .
and the adult that &apos;s coming after that , even one or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know that today . these are hundreds of <unk> .
that took me a little curious . i hear that , because i &apos;d like to ask you , and here are a lot of people who have been out of india -- people who have spent their childhood here .
so , next one , i was on the phone .
october , november , december . that &apos;s not the time of the northeast monsoon .
okay , you put your eggs at the time of the arable arctic , during the <unk> .
it &apos;s a last week last week . the <unk> have begun , and now it &apos;s raining there .
it &apos;s a pretty incredible <unk> .
unbelievable . this is the <unk> length of a <unk> . it &apos;s quite incredible .
that &apos;s what i did from my life .
and everybody thought i &apos;d be good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , what about <unk> ? &quot;
in front of my surgery , i looked at them , and i was like , &quot; how am i going to do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , <unk> . these guys here are the community .
so i was quite successful . and if you &apos;ve reached all that , what is it that you do , and i &apos;ve talked about the <unk> and other things , but what motivates one ?
in my last tedtalk , about seven years ago , about seven years ago .
but carl norden really has cracked the code .
when the norden bombsight gets into an airplane , it &apos;s accompanied by a series of <unk> penguins .
the chemical plant is about three km .
after the war , there was a <unk> -- just like the army , the air force always -- and they asked the question : how many <unk> have we actually destroyed ?
i described to you the opposite of a success story .
a walk in a country or one journey shows these diversity of human species in amazing ways .
we ask for the human ancestry .
but based on what data does ?
imagine you need to be <unk> .
it was a africans in which global diversity is based upon global diversity .
the sahara ones was much larger than today .
the people that kill the animals they were <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , moved to northern and followed by about 55 years ago , in the middle east in the middle east in the middle east in the middle east in the middle east in a rare <unk> phase of the sahara desert .
the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe doesn &apos;t move through complexity .
so let &apos;s go .
what you see here , the blue areas are about a one-thousandth of light than the red areas .
it &apos;s about smaller distances than gravity works , which explains why you and i are smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re going to be familiar with the dna of dna .
so let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , something else happened .
now you might ask yourself , &quot; what about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good when it &apos;s about <unk> .
and then you have to decide how you invest in your 52 choices , and you &apos;ve never heard of a <unk> .
but a wonderful trial has predicted that .
but if you get the driver &apos;s license , you get the box if you don &apos;t want to give the organs .
the other group gets two apples , one is taken .
there &apos;s more tomorrow it &apos;s easy .
that &apos;s just an example .
it &apos;s a song about a so-called <unk> , a creatures that mimics a creature that &apos;s kind of imitating a creature .
hi , who is it , please ?
thank you .
the knowledge has too much influence on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent their walter raleigh to separate their human part of their divine portion .
do you have a child ?
elizabeth : <unk> you out ! you go out ! you go out !
i went to a friend of mine , and he went to his <unk> in <unk> hill in the 20th floor , a really rich area in mumbai .
it &apos;s a contradiction .
we have lived less than one dollar a day -- about 15 years .
and you &apos;ve got to use bananas from the ground to show that forests is worth more than a self-serving conceit . &quot;
he said , &quot; you can &apos;t get a person to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if on a limited planet is all going to be sustainable , how can we achieve that ?
ooh has to work with pepsi .
this is nine of them .
at the end , i think , 60 percent of the world &apos;s electricity production at the table and 25 percent of the world &apos;s assets .
that &apos;s not confused .
but they don &apos;t just buy the juice ; they buy the carbon in the trees , to address the <unk> of the <unk> , which is coming to europe to europe .
so the communication is going to be the communication between the brain and the spinal cord ; this leads to a complete and sustained paralysis of the fittest .
after several years , we &apos;ve managed to develop a electrochemical <unk> , which is <unk> the nervous system of the spinal cord of a <unk> into a waking state .
we &apos;ve been working on 10 years to achieve this goal .
so after a few weeks , we have a programmable pump to inject a individual <unk> straight into the spinal cord .
and i was a child who was the school .
he was talking about the world , as she is &quot; and the world as she should be . &quot;
and by doing that , these women got a lot of obstacles out of the way .
in the white house , and the desk where he &apos;s sitting is called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and the last day , the woman came up with everything , and we talked to each other quickly , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you <unk> me something ? &quot;
i mean , this <unk> is a <unk> of the voice , because it &apos;s mysterious -- as you can see -- it &apos;s totally <unk> , and it &apos;s primal .
they didn &apos;t have anything .
so the internet takes off the internet and instructions .
one of the most popular forms of the world that &apos;s been run by the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube could have done or google .
and today , wikipedia is so <unk> that you can actually find them on the maps of restaurants in china .
and that &apos;s how wikipedia understood .
this is a blog that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
why ? there &apos;s a trickiness about <unk> <unk> .
the world didn &apos;t end in the 90s .
and we see that the impact of the human rights in some countries is very , very strong .
all of this costs money .
and it was done a lot of time to give students with <unk> , or social families , to give the same opportunities .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in ashanti <unk> , the teachers are going to stay in the classroom and have a lot of horsepower in the classroom .
some people claim that the transformation of the <unk> is a <unk> .
but if you look at the question of this perspective , you see what &apos;s happened in the last 60 years .
and i went about 15 kilometers to get to the <unk> .
so this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could do it with phones .
so it creates a business for you .
&quot; government has to offer economically <unk> services . &quot;
once upon a long , long time ago , a long , long time ago , when i was 24 years old , i studied at the st. john &apos;s medical college in bangalore .
and you can see my card if i put them here .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do with . . i &amp; gt ; i &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan is going through a period of war , with lower life expectancy .
and they decided not only to invest in health and education , but also began to grow the economy .
washington , d.c. went outside .
not the bubble , not my bubbles , but the financial bubble .
will the <unk> countries have truly accept a completely global economy , and the power transition from where it was in the last 50 to 100 , 100 to 100 years ?
the rest of the diagram is a very mysterious substance called &quot; dark energy . &quot;
but that explains the entire existence of all the mass .
and give you the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s going on during the microscope .
they move away from each other because the space gets bigger .
in fact , looking at things like cluster -- their <unk> , as many of you , as a function of time -- can we bring into experience , in the way that dark matter and dark energy are co-located in the room to form structure .
the big questions in physics .
read banjo boys : <unk> bluegrass ? new jersey ?
so , recycling and reusing are <unk> here .
marc <unk> : 1.3 million reasons to reinvent the <unk>
and in fact , there were this transformation in gay men in the united states .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and many children .
in uganda , we see that the spread of calcium carbonate .
it &apos;s going to end up with quite similar <unk> .
but openness and communications has a price when we think of disease , that should not be surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> , once again , the aids statistics in africa from a economic perspective and comes into a surprising conclusion : all of our knowledge about the spread of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated with it because i saw this kind of <unk> italian <unk> .
it was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , because he was on the front of the front , but every time he went into a tunnel , he built a <unk> . when she rolled out of the tunnel , there was a kind of <unk> .
and these lines look at the water like a magnet .
and then we ask ourselves , why the membrane clogged and why it &apos;s going to be so much electricity .
for instance , in the <unk> of <unk> into a material .
in <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , we &apos;re working with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine benyus : biomimicry in use
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and fortunately , no boys .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because that was once again and again .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s pray . &quot;
this was a <unk> for over 1,000 pounds in this prison .
second , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
so let me tell you now from a project that we did a few years later , a kind of development of captcha .
it &apos;s basically how you start to start with a old book .
the number of sides are actually going to be so high that the number of words that we use a day is very , very large .
some are more funny .
at the time , the web is divided into several languages .
then my favorite question is .
there &apos;s a way to fly two flies with one another .
but what &apos;s even more surprising is the translations that we get from the <unk> , even if you &apos;re just a beginner , the translations we get are also just as basic as the professional <unk> , and that &apos;s very surprising .
because people are learning value , they don &apos;t have to pay for money , pay them to their time .
the power site , the company , is doing what you really good at .
it &apos;s all over the active participation of everything else than normal .
and zipcar provides a very powerful , <unk> service , which works .
for aristotle , it was good for aristotle , the goal of all the other things .
perhaps these people are right . his thoughts , perhaps , is perhaps not good .
ten percent of the time goes on , ... sex versus sex .
i played the violent africans , the african terrorists .
now , from the first time , we didn &apos;t have any clearer winner -- so it had no one the absolute majority -- so the elections in a second round three weeks later , three weeks later .
now , here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
so i went to la jolla , and i learned surfing .
the people in the 17th century had not really much understanding how we know that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that we breathe that out of a particular reason .
and so , in charles , i &apos;ll give you money to give you a building , and you can meet there , but talk about religion , not about religion .
now , reality is what you can see .
i thought everyone was going to make a little bit of a mind that would do that .
it &apos;s just to see what would happen if you mix the two .
so i have something that isn &apos;t personal .
if you want to get rich today , entrepreneur .
you say , if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere , you don &apos;t smoke -- they don &apos;t smoke at all . we &apos;re measuring it for 20 years very carefully of satellites , and it doesn &apos;t mess .
<unk> <unk> <unk> talks about the foundation of modern science : the experiment . he shares stories from the 17th century , and from his own <unk> in the garden and <unk> the curiosity , inspiration and caring of good science in all their forms .
i wanted to represent a simple kind of a living body that uses these <unk> , habitable spaces .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a nickname for new york and &quot; <unk> , &quot; the <unk> and <unk> that emerges from the feeling of <unk> in an urban environment .
i love traveling , and berlin is one of my favorites .
and all the time i didn &apos;t have a single rat on some of these places until recently , when i was in the london <unk> .
the first question is , and maybe you &apos;re typing them , either on a piece of paper , physically , or on a virtual slate in your head , and you can do that , you can do that .
and we then put together , &quot; we &apos;re the most <unk> college of the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- they said -- well , in their <unk> , they thought , &quot; hey , what happens during the night ? &quot;
and one of the most difficult issues is when people have a sense of how everything works , it &apos;s quite difficult to change that .
and as an expert for inorganic chemistry , i have friends and colleagues that are distinguish between the organic , living world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , they can see , <unk> , grows in a sense .
we &apos;ve even got amazing things we can rig .
and darwin himself put himself in a letter to a colleague , the presumption that life would probably be most likely in a warm small village -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what &apos;s life ? what &apos;s this fabric of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands and thousands of really large <unk> molecules in the same size like dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not a carbon in view .
we want to put them into the environment , and we want them to get rid of their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can make inorganic biology and make matter happen , it &apos;s actually going to define life in fact .
but there &apos;s one second reason why i like this <unk> : each one is going to measure each other .
and these are the professional female interviewer who sit down for an hour , and they look at their <unk> .
i was sitting in front of my computer in front of my computer , and i could see the mortality rate of this morning from <unk> on 84 .
as you know , these economists love the money , they always want more and more .
and as you can see , that doesn &apos;t make sense to compute a average of improvement that doesn &apos;t have been , and that very fast progression .
but you don &apos;t speak about that as much .
there were high , or very high , child mortality , and the families were also very big , six to eight .
this is also <unk> .
whatever is more value for money .
yes , i went to barefoot until i was 12 .
and he said to them , &quot; well , this is the <unk> question .
the whole time was a border .
and <unk> , after i think , the world will bring forward forward , it will make a difference , not just for a few , but for everybody .
9 the knee , yeah , that would be hard ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth has enough to satisfy everybody needs , but not everybody &apos;s greed . &quot;
and <unk> die .
i went to high school .
when i was on the slide of scientific research research -- 40 laboratories -- if two <unk> were not talking to each other , i built teams .
they &apos;re on it , and now i &apos;ve got apps in the room .
it &apos;s about improving something old and a bit old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but no longer <unk> .
but in fact , this reactor is not under high pressure , and it &apos;s not that reactive , that means that the <unk> don &apos;t tend to leave the reactor .
i &apos;m convinced that the reactor that i designed here is a cutting-edge energy source , which is great scientific projects with electricity , and i &apos;m really prepared to do that .
we &apos;re moving to a <unk> where the experience is the actual product .
there &apos;s a manufacturer that <unk> the <unk> pride for the case that they &apos;re running in the forest .
at the end of a long <unk> of good advice , he says , &quot; well , you know , he said , &quot; most of all , be against thyself .
usually you don &apos;t go to los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can run a lot out of it , in this city .
then you &apos;re going to be wrong , as an <unk> -- by making properties that you don &apos;t have .
when i was little , i was very introverted and stayed on for me .
then it was just about to start at a point , and then they started to build it up to the <unk> .
so i built it from concrete because it doesn &apos;t really matter .
that was this instrument .
and for me , this is the most important thing , because since i was a child , i wanted to convey my passion and love .
three days : the <unk> evolved to <unk> days : poor and hands , the primitive mobs starts to have these weeks of the time when the fetus are developing at the fastest . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
the complexity , in a single system , is beyond any touch , or anyone today today .
because , apparently , there &apos;s no way that <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t exist in the atmosphere of sun-like stars .
so what can you do with these spectra ?
i sent me a colleague from berkeley , <unk> <unk> , an email with a very interesting spectrum , and said , &quot; can you look at that ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- which matter and chemical elements in the universe are produced and <unk> .
because , can you imagine that all of you are going to be <unk> ?
now , imagine a object , an incredible object , or something we can &apos;t explain , and we just stand up and say , &quot; so we &apos;re going to stop . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and when we see <unk> , oxygen and oxygen , i think we &apos;ve got the perfect e.t.
i said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
i &apos;m slightly hooked on <unk> , but that &apos;s another talk .
this led to a small breakdown -- -- which actually looked like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what are you feeling of being vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you didn &apos;t have that . shut me up .
we pretend that what we do , no impact on other people .
people were guiding their meals in twitter , the diapers of their children on the iphone .
so when we think about it , they &apos;re using systematic improvements , then we think about how to be useful to our <unk> , for our <unk> and self-knowledge .
and today , i want to talk about one of the things that we &apos;re doing at the time , we wanted to find a new access to health .
steven divides : so , his story . but he &apos;s not alone .
this is why people pray .
i also love this <unk> implant , also these were the only ones that were online and available .
and here &apos;s another paper .
you have no <unk> , you have no data , that &apos;s not going to be scientific methods .
this is the curve about the <unk> .
but my brother didn &apos;t , it was at the end of my brother .
now , when we went from here to go from here , we would look at something that &apos;s 300 meters wide , 200 miles long , 28 kilometers wide , and the two gigatons weighs down .
in order to change the condition , you only need two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build that ? &quot;
we can do better than that .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution that &apos;s from the <unk> .
together , networks are ideal social systems .
and it also has implications to the systemic risk .
so that &apos;s how we could give each <unk> a <unk> .
we &apos;re looking at the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs that seem to understand our connected world from the standpoint of complexity .
<unk> have a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- unless you use expensive pumps and valves .
and we had 500 of these <unk> .
without human <unk> .
so we were up on our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t mean anything that &apos;s invented the data .
and my brain starts very quickly to think that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> to the world .
because this question requires that our external world can predict our evolutionary world , and the truth is that i can predict 10 percent of the <unk> of a person when i <unk> your entire external world .
and that &apos;s for two reasons , scientifically <unk> and <unk> .
we &apos;re moving people if you open your neck to write a positive email from the <unk> or the <unk> of somebody in your social context .
it &apos;s not to say -- a <unk> , you understand -- my father was the <unk> man in the world .
and that &apos;s how i went . i went to mit , i got off .
they said , make it happen .
they take a huge disk of cardboard .
he was the first digital media enterprise in tokyo .
do you listen that ? how cows ? this is in the morning in logan .
so there are all these things to do , but most of the love i love to experience the world , to taste the world .
and i &apos;m going to do it with passion .
their culture doesn &apos;t come in schools , and i want to tell you how to understand how we can overcome this problem .
that &apos;s why she &apos;s going to do this because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools where there are no boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or , boy , the boys have gone up ?
we have to change the attitude towards boys in elementary schools .
and you have the impression that you think that &apos;s okay .
let &apos;s see where this hypothesis is going to be .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that the &quot; why &quot; <unk> hints can give us the basic principles of nature .
i &apos;ll try to end up at the end , and i &apos;m also excited if it works .
and that was really an important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really handle on the object .
for example , we created a newspaper , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s linked to radio with my ipad , and that &apos;s a software that &apos;s on the ipad .
it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to add a <unk> . i put them around a <unk> , so that people react in the glass , when you go to them .
i &apos;m going to turn into a man in the middle of my current age , and then in an old man .
<unk> are allowed to be avoided .
radio : what do you think ?
keep it the wings together and they continue to go on .
so i &apos;ll give you a different question .
and he took a <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , who had the instruction to <unk> him day and night , but with the secret instruction , not particularly good to <unk> .
because they found that the human behavior determines the human behavior .
but now we &apos;ve got to be able to make a little bit of <unk> <unk> where you can create that kind of value . and it &apos;s also much fair .
now , if we have all the resources available , we just have to ask ourselves the question -- and thaler and <unk> have done this -- how we use these intelligent .
they &apos;re going to make the new <unk> .
they put little , <unk> <unk> .
i felt , passion , soul and heart , had my body left .
audience : no .
sb : no , no , no .
all around us , <unk> <unk> can find another replicator in this <unk> of culture .
they probably bought you .
imagine the world full of brains of brains and more memes than you are all there .
we &apos;re the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hey .
they &apos;re using us to produce the resource of the planet to produce more and more , and other amazing things we &apos;re hearing here at ted .
and are we going to see this third danger , how do we have the second one and first ?
in conjunction with <unk> -- this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the ministry of public <unk> , with different <unk> , we make more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us anymore if we do it right . &quot;
and because i had access to 70 percent of my body , it took about an hour .
so , we &apos;ve also found that it would have been good , i would have given off the pain to recover from the pain .
and how bad would the sentence be , if i was going to get caught ?
it wasn &apos;t that the <unk> individuals -- the ones that have more commandments <unk> -- fewer cheated , and that the less religious -- the ones that have never been allowed to remember at almost no time .
so if you &apos;re not thinking for a few seconds , because you get a brand , does it make a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think all these forces have very bad impact on the stock market .
but you can tell me . i work in the dress .
these are the <unk> i can show you today .
and all of a sudden amazon is going to be the brand , and it &apos;s lighting with the <unk> , determines how they want to spend their money , what money is and what it is .
maybe that might seem to be a big leap ?
i don &apos;t have to explain it to that -- last week , i had to explain it to my nine-year-olds -- quantities are structures that are sperm from one individual to another <unk> .
and i already knew that animals like the <unk> here , or even most animals don &apos;t stabilize their tissue , by changing it through bones .
and that was because every hydrostatic skeleton that we found out to be found in nature , about the same <unk> .
all of which i showed that were really surprised about it .
a funny song song about global warming , by jill sobule .
well , i must now have to .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; are the virtues of a great education .
the <unk> <unk> looks at about it , and ben became a <unk> .
so , what &apos;s the area of this character ?
i was forced to leave my home to leave the democratic republic of congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> , the <unk> of the united nations has spent the burden of the country to over 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not at the goal .
they have to be very affordable .
but could not be done for that corner of the <unk> ?
they &apos;d be teaching by the governments of the governments , and in many cases they also have them .
but let &apos;s assume that our goal would be new economic activity to the base of the pyramid .
because , you know , because you need a whole bunch of these little transactions to make your profits .
he liked to sit it on her lap because he said that it &apos;s painful for him to be in his own bed .
since the past time , when sir <unk> <unk> and the british society for <unk> , that that &apos;s why the sun shines .
so , what &apos;s fusion ? here is something <unk> .
and that energy is that we &apos;re running fusion .
it &apos;s as high as a traditional <unk> .
we have to make it a power station .
but it &apos;s the largest arab land , and it &apos;s also one with great influence .
at the end of the democracy , they wanted to do the democracy , but they were about all countries that had their opinion for the last month of the last month in the last month , and it was only four percent .
but the expectations of people &apos;s rights to their future .
so the question is , &quot; what motivates the money motivates support for women ? &quot;
i promise you she has read the news .
no one can listen to you , just sending them a text .
you could see the immediate impacts of law or a <unk> speech on a <unk> , and see what happens as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds , and i went about 35 .
this is a rocket for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
from the smallest <unk> to the intellectual forces of nature .
we can do it as individuals , as individuals , and give us a chance to do it .
we believe that somebody else , somebody <unk> , somebody <unk> , somebody who &apos;s going to solve this problem .
we flew him not in the pacific .
it took 10 full of prototypes until we had something that was really flying .
and so there &apos;s one hand on the one hand , which is possible , and this is serious what that means .
and let &apos;s think of our moral effort .
and the director was quite confused and told me that he thought it was mad , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are tough offenders .
it took several of these events until i found what i should do .
when i started this program four years ago with this program , my <unk> plan was to create a <unk> .
and they &apos;re looking down for <unk> , which is so tiny and tiny .
i feel blessed and fortunate that 15 years ago i had the courage to put my post on at an nyu , and to return to my home , where i had this incredible rides with this group of ethiopia , with this group of <unk> children from ethiopia , both of russia and russia .
and how many times i would have to die , before i understand that it didn &apos;t exist from the beginning ?
and i was a really good dancer .
mysteriously , these findings are not <unk> my <unk> , this sense of otherness .
that was because i didn &apos;t know what was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we could have , if we honor the define death of ourselves , the privilege of life and what &apos;s going on next to the next .
and this is a cafe on the ocean in britain .
but instead of looking at that , we focused on the way .
and we also discovered that as a broken structure and a <unk> way to get through that structure .
but what we found was that seeds -- this really important project that &apos;s going to happen -- but that seed -- in the leading botanical gardens , seeds are not issued the seeds .
we worked with a <unk> to develop a <unk> of the seed cathedral , which is , even when you &apos;re visually impaired , it &apos;s kind of <unk> and soft , the piece of landscape you see here .
it &apos;s just the first few bars that you have , and the rest is only for postcards .
the book wears the title &quot; the blank slate &quot; , the popular notion that the human mind is a blank slate and all its structure of its socialization , culture , education and experience .
all right , there &apos;s a series of political reasons that they enjoy the people well .
and by the way , it &apos;s still not clear whether these generalizations are appropriately , but they seemed to be <unk> .
another one of the <unk> and <unk> at the universities are actually in decline in the decline .
now , the other hot iron is the parenting .
and i think you can &apos;t tell that better .
i also call <unk> , just like <unk> , and you don &apos;t like it , but it &apos;s going to be it .
there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no nonsense .
he said , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think right now . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s odd .
so i wondered what would happen if we challenge some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s going to be -- we &apos;ve explained the war , as a society , each of us .
your iphone without the people who skin the same skin , same circuitry , the same keyboard , and over and over again .
and then it became a bit darker and <unk> , and now it &apos;s <unk> pages long .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; is it true that you &apos;ve got to be here in here ? &quot;
but how are you sitting in a sane way ?
so all the things that came to tony on the <unk> are evidence that , according to his clinician , that he &apos;s going insane on this new kind of crazy thing . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
he came up in <unk> , and <unk> 30 percent of the workforce , american cities just as in <unk> .
and i added , &quot; i have a list list of psychopathic features in my pocket .
and the authoritarian ones are always the extreme aspects of the interviewee .
anyway , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend in the world went to the <unk> from the rest of the world .
and as a result of that hero , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , i &apos;m teaching the true islam . &quot;
it may be that a large war is between east and west <unk> , and that it &apos;s needed democracy versus communism .
and even though the president of <unk> reasons , very , very well , very well , very well that islam is not the enemy of the enemy , there is nevertheless , a natural impulse at <unk> the other side as an enemy .
when the kiss in 2000 , you just observed the peak of the best adage that scientists have ever been in the scientists that scientists have ever been in -- which is at that point as endangered species .
on the day after our arrived , two of us have got two of us with the oversight of a <unk> . space 2 has more than 4,000 <unk> penguins .
we used this way to be used in the treasure rescue .
and that &apos;s really important because the african penguin was explaining to an endangered species .
on the <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> , in front of a <unk> , in the <unk> and even before the police seal .
the people are open for the <unk> .
we started this campaign -- very amusing -- called &quot; each <unk> . &quot;
that &apos;s not a <unk> of second grade .
these teachings would be <unk> , abstract .
hillel analysis on a leg and said , &quot; what you &apos;re doing is your neighbor &apos;s not going to be your neighbor . that &apos;s the <unk> . the rest are commentary .
now , that &apos;s not the whole story .
and achilles takes <unk> <unk> and shares him carefully about his father , and the two men see each other and see each other as an divine .
now , this view of cells has really taken me into biology and science , looking at living cells in the microscope .
every grain of sand is one tenth of one millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this picture was the beginning of the <unk> .
we all look at the same from inside , believe me .
the walls are made up of 700 signals , extinct concrete .
and that on the left is a x-ray .
it has human transmission .
in the x-ray , we see all the little <unk> in the plate .
i had to put the car in the middle , for yourselves , not really simple job .
yes , they gave 12 monkeys for a week , and after this week , they just used them as a toilet .
the science tells you that we will live forever .
no , i <unk> a tooth .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you very much .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we don &apos;t agree with each other .
not professor and <unk> , only two ghosts , ready to <unk> .
and that was my life in order .
all i saw in the manufacturing was that there was right <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
then time to process the information ?
we &apos;ve spent a lot of time dealing with a billion dollars of business -- you &apos;ll hear a little bit of <unk> <unk> , where it was , and what we found was shocking , and what we found was a shocking , but more .
then there are dan etete .
we were upset that these companies had multiplied their <unk> and the most important in london <unk> <unk> very , very <unk> .
that &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be all sick . we &apos;re all sick . people leave us .
there are places where you can &apos;t go , you can &apos;t think of the worlds that you can &apos;t inhabit , you can &apos;t inhabit the worlds you can &apos;t inhabit .
they have a <unk> and a freedom of which i think it &apos;s the platform of a new <unk> .
it has made a decision to get rid of <unk> or <unk> , but their life tells you that that &apos;s not going to happen other girls .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you put that thing on your head , and then something happens .
but it doesn &apos;t do it . &quot;
i miss michael .
he didn &apos;t find his staff , but he said , &quot; you go into the rehab , or you &apos;re going to be fired and high . &quot;
hey ! we hit them , the <unk> . let &apos;s pull ourselves out .
when it &apos;s in the box , it &apos;s the <unk> , it &apos;s going to make it happen .
so the other things that the word combines as well as often in adults is that we should be using this old word word word word , when it comes to criticize , which is associated with <unk> and <unk> thinking .
when i was the ability of my sister <unk> , the 10 percent of all the interest that i have on their last loan , i will spend their ability to get more money from me until they paid it back .
it &apos;s why we &apos;re not living in the dark times .
and the third ones are all sound that we create people , the <unk> .
this is after the basket .
there are many <unk> of <unk> , among other things , the way animals teach us to dance and sing that i &apos;m going to do for another time .
so that was extremely embarrassing .
and if you look at how much that is , this is 16 kb .
so 37 is our demographic .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very nice concert .
and these are the subjects that are at the heart of us .
a generation that &apos;s much more important from video games than in the real world .
all of these are problems outside of my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games is for our civilization .
finally ! that &apos;s it . that &apos;s it .
it would really like that very well .
so , you get a little bit quick about the simple thing , when you make more . that &apos;s what we like .
and then they look at them , and that &apos;s howard -- i thought that at least a long time , until she explained to me , that was to be a little bit more difficult to think of it .
it &apos;s going to go to the other direction .
girl : there were a ball and a <unk> because it &apos;s two totally different crystals , and when you fall at it at the same time , you might be <unk> .
but we could not train a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and on that , it &apos;s a <unk> . &quot;
in the end , we &apos;re going to move ourselves through ourselves as well as we changed the world around us .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to have incredible implications .
why do you do what you do ?
everybody would want to have the new version .
they affect us too much .
you &apos;re going to be <unk> about this stage .
i &apos;m going to put his words right in the order .
&quot; well , yeah , i said , &quot; well , you know that .
she said , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do it again . &quot;
we looked at , and i was grateful because it only said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s just insane . &quot;
the goal of the project is very simple .
this is completely personalized medicine in <unk> .
now the answer is a team team .
i work with the <unk> and the <unk> , which is what some serious problems have to do with the project , problems that shouldn &apos;t have to have .
in medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want a change , just not when an <unk> engineer is an answer to the answer .
you can really find new solutions that haven &apos;t been seen before , and it &apos;s very quick .
yes , good , you guys guys enjoy my life , because <unk> were round , from beautiful <unk> forms .
no , but it &apos;s true , the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t tell you to draw nice cartoons .
thank you .
so , &quot; our lonely earth , &quot; took me a lot about the meeting with the audience .
we have spent a lot of time for the existence of animals on the planet than they have been here , until we reach the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of these very thin <unk> of all the planet , and we had a very extensive death of the dinosaurs , the death of these beautiful <unk> , <unk> here , and <unk> on here and so much else .
it &apos;s the supreme operator , the t. rex of his time .
they hate us animals .
that &apos;s when materials comes from the depths of the earth and the surface comes across the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m <unk> from the coast , which is going to happen to me ?
you have a crash . you get two options : you &apos;re going to die , or you &apos;re taking the hydrogen sulfide and , let &apos;s say 75 percent of you will be saved , <unk> .
<unk> : blessing and <unk> .
some of them are countries that agree that deregulation or even no regulation of the best way is to promote investment .
the answer is simple : the chinese define these factories as chemical providers , not as an <unk> , and they don &apos;t check it .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my office to make you all together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a secure environment .
now we have the impression that it &apos;s the beginning of a new way of doing the <unk> international tasks .
human beings are going to be a very simple question : can i give that person back to this person ?
or to find the boys who was taking the fire at the beginning to see if you could change it . &quot;
okay , ready ? go .
i was fire and fragile .
again , again , we saw the spoken word poetry .
after the fight , he shook his <unk> , <unk> hair and said , &apos; you &apos;re a god . &apos; no , anderson , you are god . &quot;
i travel a lot , when i teach , and i don &apos;t always get to see how my students get their third step , but i was fortunate enough to see their journey to see their journey as they did it .
my parents called me sarah , which is a <unk> name .
i want to talk to you first about a few ideas that drove me to become a <unk> .
when i saw that the war for everybody born was such incredibly sinister consequences , and that the <unk> could actually become a factor in the <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a <unk> .
at the same time in south africa , after nelson mandela had been released from prison , the black population was the last stage of liberation from apartheid .
the next day , i went to rwanda , and it was like i was going to go to hell in the <unk> .
after the fall of <unk> in indonesia , i started studying the conditions of poverty in a country that was on the way to the schoolhouse .
a hospital in the &quot; doctors without bounds &quot; in a refugee camp .
the <unk> has become so efficient that the percentage of soldiers that survive is much higher than any other than any other than in our history .
to make sure that as little as possible , we have all those procedures at choice .
so you pick it up .
but that &apos;s a broad and very difficult subject , so i had to pass through .
the size of the population -- here &apos;s big china , here &apos;s a great india here .
and in all the eastern religion , japan was the same in the same time .
because death is going to be a child with another child .
and what &apos;s the reason in qatar ?
they have a great <unk> .
all the religion in the world are able to adapt their values and adapt to this new world .
and then , like all the rest of our generation , we lived in a <unk> .
eight . eight .
in india alone , my <unk> best friends , and i went from door to door to the same picture , to every house in india , and we did about a billion <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all <unk> -- and i asked them the questions they want to ask them .
i think we owe a lot of debt debt and ron st. john a lot of gratitude , i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- it &apos;s the founder of gphin .
larry brilliant + , first , aren &apos;t you mad because of the injury of the <unk> ?
we &apos;ve created a <unk> , &quot; the climate group . &quot;
why should we have a positive impact on the world , in the world than a company ?
they save 85 percent of the light with a led that they have left with an old light bulb .
sometimes people think that 100 percent will be quite hard , and we had this conversation in business .
a <unk> paid for itself in seven or eight years .
from our 17,000 bones in fully ikea , today , we &apos;re 47 percent of women today , but that &apos;s not enough , and we want to close that gap , and that path until the high management consequences .
there was one equation in my family , about this : when you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not living .
this is what he wrote , &quot; is the subjective structure of reality . &quot;
anyone , whose attitude you &apos;re going to go through , or your shoes out of the ears .
at the end of our <unk> , we realized the openness of the other .
and as i &apos;d like to go back to bangalore , i would be home to vibrant with my friends , where we were dealing with different topics , as they were advising , <unk> across new <unk> , where a drink is often known as what they paid their 14 years old <unk> .
it &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and suggesting that it &apos;s going to make the lives of his child mortality . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this <unk> seemed to be quite happy , and it hasn &apos;t been <unk> , even though i had been killed in liberia .
and why are we responsible for that ?
it &apos;s troubling -- not ? -- that the media of the world is doing a bad job , that a small group of activists is able to publish more of that kind of information than the rest of the <unk> .
j yep . that was the front page in the guardian , and it was then built in all countries around kenya , in the <unk> and south bronx .
j the implications to the people who worked on it were <unk> .
and there &apos;s lots of information .
i &apos;d be interested in just because of what we &apos;ve heard about -- i &apos;m curious about the opinion of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you have to be careful with the notion of hacker .
and just a month ago , it was all about <unk> <unk> .
and from all these numbers , i &apos;ll just start with just two or three variables .
now , this piece here can be very different , depending on where you put it in .
i read that in a <unk> , i read about it in a <unk> , which is between the <unk> for responsible medicine and seven <unk> .
so , the best way to do it is the best flute dictionary for a chicken doesn &apos;t leave it for a chicken , but it &apos;s not going to leave it for a chicken until it &apos;s going to be black , and a <unk> of parents to take brown sugar or saltwater .
and then in the next summer i worked under the line of dr. <unk> on the <unk> in fort <unk> , texas .
and this realization is incredible for the efficiency of chemotherapy , maybe for many different cancers .
for instance , <unk> organic compounds of chemical pollutants that are in our schools , and in the workplace .
because all of these solutions are of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the next generations .
and immediately would call a voice : &quot; gosh ! &quot;
after the conference , after the conference , people came to me , men and women .
! !
a prosthetic is no longer for the need to be a lack of peace .
we &apos;re all different perspectives .
i was as an astronomer as an astronomer for the olympic games .
about 80 percent of these <unk> are young people .
and they &apos;re most unemployment , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the banks , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> from europe and america , the products that they produce .
they have a kind of a means that you can put on a piece of chicken or fish , and it &apos;s going to look like cattle .
people think about the following questions : are we going to have our environment farther to be a higher gdp of a higher gdp ?
up there , there &apos;s nothing to eat , but the conditions were ideal for the <unk> .
now , the series hasn &apos;t even been covering , so they &apos;re the first to see that .
mars is more like mars as the earth , it seems to be the same as being <unk> .
sousa did fear that we were able to lose the possibility of this , quote , &quot; <unk> . &quot; they would take us .
but more importantly , consciousness has been used as a universal tool to generate new kinds of information technology for free to their subscribers , and then in 1940 , in 1940 , as an <unk> of the fees , the majority of the solar panels is to bmi . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
i i am ...
for the <unk> , i &apos;m going to try as a good taste of course , i &apos;m trying to ask a little bit of the government , a mistake , isn &apos;t it ?
this awareness is incredibly <unk> , incredibly <unk> .
okay , i don &apos;t want to show anybody here , but i just realized that the person on the right next to you is a liar .
&quot; honey , you don &apos;t look at it , no . &quot;
however , another trial showed that strangers three times in the first 10 minutes of yours are lying in the first 10 minutes .
this is <unk> with your kitten .
i &apos;ll tell you again .
you &apos;re looking at liars not to your eyes .
we say &quot; yes , &quot; as we shake your head .
the science has a lot more <unk> on daylight .
look carefully , and you &apos;re going to see the <unk> smile in the entire video .
so in that much quieter world can make it sense for us , a little bit more explicit in terms of our moral moral compass .
and that &apos;s right now , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , we often think that language is the world where we live , but that &apos;s not true .
so what you &apos;re thinking about as an ecologist , if not even known joke about harry , <unk> as a ethnic <unk> .
six months after that , without any cases , they got me free .
that &apos;s what troubles me .
when i was 10 , i read james <unk> &apos;s &quot; <unk> country &quot; and i was broken .
i gave you a new song .
that &apos;s why i took time to study cola .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you incentivize based on the implications that you &apos;re doing to these remote village ?
<unk> me not as special as &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;ll wait for that .
many more people would have been reinfected .
today i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first of all , what we &apos;ve lost , and the second thing we &apos;ve lost .
here you can see the most part of the living self-portrait of the florida <unk> .
if there &apos;s no fishery there on a reef , because it &apos;s intentional , or <unk> , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years , the fish go back , eat the sea , and then the algae grow again .
you can see the boundary of the <unk> , because there are all the boats all the time .
if it &apos;s so good when it &apos;s so simple , how much of it is ?
so the protection of awkwardness and the ocean has become a huge amount of money and <unk> facilities , and that &apos;s not acceptable .
in the coral reefs , we found that the pyramid is the equivalent of <unk> , where five lions come to a <unk> .
okay , <unk> , i thank you for letting us a part of your spiritual . thank you .

we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific in <unk> .
these worms grow several centimeters in the week .
the concept of <unk> is futile .
and the rest of one percent , according to the formula that you can use in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure , which of <unk> , measurements , <unk> , dots , etc . , etc .
the students have to do these kinds of things . they have to be able to make them .
and the best part , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t receive the answer from the <unk> at the end of the permian .
what &apos;s going to happen with the small hadron collider ?
this is the fastest growing young population in the world .
it &apos;s <unk> . there &apos;s no government schools in slums .
this is a computer that was installed by the entrance to your slum , from a <unk> social entrepreneur called the <unk> trials , which showed that children under certain requirements , and they can learn how kids can learn from certain conditions . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

you should put it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are ambitious frameworks , schools , <unk> , hospitals , where innovation can happen , and informal environments , communities , families , social networks , social networks .
every child to the age of 15 , which have a place in school , will be in 2015 .
and as i look at it , this scene comes down to tears , and that i &apos;ve been doing for 25 years with me for 25 years .
so , here &apos;s a couple of parents of teenagers ? all right , we have to cook for them -- and they &apos;ll spit every night for two , three or four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he continues all over the place , and he goes all the time !
these <unk> , people like me , are treated as citizens , and it &apos;s just finished in front of our noses .
so people have to be afraid of their job , so they don &apos;t show who you really are , here at us . it &apos;s not just north carolina ; in all states , without refueling , it &apos;s legal .
think about it .
and i got anxiety .
about three years ago i read an article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us to become what we could have .
that &apos;s how evolution operates .
and in fact , here &apos;s this insect .
i got a word on somebody &apos;s first time .
it &apos;s not only dependent on 43 degrees fahrenheit for about two days , but it keeps a constant temperature .
but the contrast is going to be something like that . they fit out in front of the background .
this is where the americans put the russians , and yes , it was -- a game .
she began to tell me about it , and all the parents are going to see the <unk> .
i &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> .
our lives will be represented by data , and the presentation of this data is for us to create excellent interfaces that can tell great stories .
i &apos;ve also thrown a look at the different <unk> , because you can select what you want to highlight from the data .
it &apos;s a <unk> man sitting in the box and controlling that <unk> .
it &apos;s about 11 sheep per hour , which is a <unk> of 68 cents .
in the case , you can do it -- what you see on the left is the <unk> , and on the right-hand side , you see the <unk> as he was 16 people who didn &apos;t know what to do .
bell bell : <unk> , <unk> <unk> : and we took all those individual pieces and put them into another mechanical turk .
but we knew we needed the right person to make us behind it and we could build something .
and underneath all individuals , people have submitted to the project .
thank you .
so i took pictures of images , cut , and i added them together in <unk> .
one more convincing consequence of that is you only see a part of his picture , and that leads to a very free architecture .
and sometimes i have emotional response to news , as the earthquake in haiti in 2010 .
then i went 50 miles , 60 miles .
it &apos;s like the different layers of which we are made of , and what we &apos;re facing the world as our identity .
another <unk> is in a public library in san jose , california .
so each building has his own personality .
it &apos;s perhaps easier than ever easier to do a good net .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly ignorant .
it &apos;s just too weird .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , when you met someone who was very poor , you called this one &quot; unfortunate . &quot;
and that &apos;s going to be in the youngest trial with angels and <unk> , and the sky will open .
i told them the action of madame <unk> .
what i think , really , i think , is success and failure .
we should make sure that we are really the creator of our own self-interest .
alain de botton : a <unk> , <unk> <unk>

they &apos;re encoded into the liquid liquid .
my breath is down to three <unk> the minute .
that should worry about me , i didn &apos;t care about it .
i started with this thing .
it &apos;s the only <unk> i &apos;m interested in .
that &apos;s already happening today .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it could be a particularly <unk> <unk> , as many of these things today are special <unk> , because they &apos;re not so good .
many of you have got the phillips direct life .
this is an important part of our lives . we should sleep to a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s now go from sleep to pathology .
so , we can change the medicine of regenerative medicine , in all ages , or <unk> , or <unk> children to the senior ; the <unk> arena is changing ; the whole spectrum of disease -- i hope i &apos;ve got you a sense of it -- i hope i &apos;ve got you a sense of it .
so , i hope i &apos;ve convinced you -- the implications are enormous and the implications of disease are equally impressive in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create stable societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a particular person named alvin , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it destroys the whole system .

and she &apos;s a great thing .
it should be faster .
you might ask yourself , how do we make these <unk> .
this is the only cookbook in the world , in the <unk> <unk> .
this is the finished hamburger .
a talk about surgical robot is always a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more qualified than doctors .
but ultimately , it &apos;s the last resort .
they had to give their intuitive movements with the instruments .
i told you about the great , complicated robot .
and as you can see , it &apos;s going to be useful to do something useful , it can &apos;t be that <unk> .
and we don &apos;t even have to go through these <unk> .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , so it was partly my fault .
we &apos;re not only showing that bacteria can be the solution for plastic , but also that the openness of <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of risk unexpected discoveries is allowed to make discoveries . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

i think in my family , we had a lot of fortunate . because we &apos;ve learned design backwards .
<unk> , very good !
ed : and then <unk> feet is a historic <unk> , and in the <unk> history , the paris here is actually taken their beginning here , where the message has been . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

one of them is known as the population . the world population has gone up by two to almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
carl <unk> : beautiful here .
you can see the lines check when the population occurs .
now , before i talk about the cost , i have to find very clear that .
this is actually what liberation looks like .
but only recently , we &apos;ve only been able to look at technical advances , now the <unk> and quantum locking .
first , a few strands of magnetic strands are inside , but the superconductor doesn &apos;t like it , if you &apos;re moving , because your movements use energy , and that &apos;s the most <unk> thing .
so , that round magnet , i can also use that to create a sustainable rail .
and it was inspired by this quote from douglas adams . the situation is from &quot; hitchhiking by the galaxy . &quot;
because , of course , they don &apos;t explain how to do it , if you want to do it yourself and don &apos;t have any <unk> .
but even though they weren &apos;t convinced they were , they said , &quot; okay , we call back . &quot; -- have never .
<unk> : yeah , i got .

you can see some symbols on the left there are some symbols that show what &apos;s left with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they &apos;re always getting older .
or even if we &apos;re going to be much older to drive our cars , so we can go to people .
they were gone in a moment .
it became obvious that we can &apos;t win .
the two specialists are going to help me get the outcome on the screen .
one of the journalists said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
the <unk> are <unk> , just like jewish settlement .
i think there are a couple of reasons , but here &apos;s just a few of the things that we &apos;re going to focus on .
he was attracted by the flames , he killed her , he was like a <unk> to light , a little bit of a <unk> .
let me go from door to the international community , and see if somebody <unk> me or troops for those <unk> .
but for sergio , it was too late .
he saw her .
<unk> power : a complicated hero
this is what jobs and possibilities for all of the <unk> .
but today i &apos;m going to talk about the food of food , because this year , last year and 2008 , there &apos;s no food available , for every <unk> lbs of calories .
and i go to these shops when you are there , if you &apos;re going to go out into the field to see what you can receive , and i &apos;m sure you can &apos;t get food .
we &apos;re seeing changes of participation in schools through girls .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that instead of going into subsidies and other things , they invest in a wood program .
thank you .
we could do the same with cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me how many <unk> i <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s about 24 hours of what i do .
it &apos;s never been shown .
the <unk> of these magnets is so big that we can see with this technique a single neutron .
you don &apos;t need to shrink the tumor .
when the magnet is big enough , and your resolution , you can actually embed all the proteins in your body and begin to understand the individual system .
most of us find this , and interestingly , 12 vibrations is about the <unk> of a <unk> people .
for example , for example , for example , as long as a few seconds , they would feel uncomfortable ; longer than a few minutes , and they would leave the room in <unk> .
it &apos;s all recognized . and that &apos;s the tune at the most part in the world .
and i was there with two very good friends of mine , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
as we cross miles and miles of <unk> -- <unk> <unk> that could be <unk> .
as i &apos;m standing here today , i &apos;m talking to you , i &apos;m about five years ago .
there &apos;s 10 kilometers in front of the coast and in 17,500 feet .
the oceans determine climate and weather , they hold the temperature of temperature and shapes the chemistry of the world .
there are light up there ...
that &apos;s the result , if you don &apos;t know that there are boundaries for what we allowed to take .
in the last three years , the united states , for example , <unk> km km sea of ocean protected ocean .
we need <unk> , new technologies for exploration of ocean exploration .
and a lot of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wings of the insects were producing enough force to keep it in the air .
let &apos;s explore this notion of simplicity .
this is a beautiful image of the visual planetarium of a mouse from the lab of jeff <unk> , and you can see the wonderful pictures of brains that he showed in his talk .
it <unk> a <unk> to make any behavior , other <unk> , other <unk> , and patterns , and you can think that this is working in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> computer model of the human brain .
it &apos;s home and drinks tea .
when you look closer to the surface of the neocortex , you &apos;ve got that it &apos;s made of louder components . <unk> processors , like in a computer .
how many per megabyte tree is there ? where are you positioned ?
we can look at the tissue . and we can change neurons .
we can upload all of these neurons , every single one in its own self-interest , and watch what &apos;s going on .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain can be solved . mental disorders , memory , perception : it &apos;s made of neurons and electric signals , and he &apos;s got them with a supercomputer that uses the brain to <unk> synapses .
it would have two or three thousand bombs .
the air force began to build smaller models , and started this .
this is what nasa did to get a <unk> that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there &apos;s so much we can get from people .
the bottom ? yellow .
when you ask people that question , they usually think that there &apos;s something to do with the culture .
the countries on the right , the ones that give a lot , have a slightly different form .
i &apos;ll give you another example of this .
but it &apos;s going to go back and get it back to more complex .
there &apos;s a online dating service for 59 dollars .
the <unk> idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know that well .
in medical expressing , in medical express , this is our view .
and radio waves are limited .
in addition , you can only use the eyes of your eyes with lower energy .
your intensity can be very quick , and it can be turned out very quickly .
they &apos;re critical critical critical .
but that &apos;s just the way .
cars have <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other and can communicate through the <unk> traffic control and so on .
dna is what life is mean .
actually , it &apos;s not that many data , actually .
you have the <unk> of your genome , and the power of making a customized drug that &apos;s better than today -- it doesn &apos;t have any side effects .
it &apos;s really simple -- only <unk> genes -- but we could totally <unk> it .
we &apos;re not running as little organisms alone in the world , but are part of a great ecosystem .
the consequences can be bad -- if we move or the earth -- but that &apos;s just the outgrowth of one of us .
now , i &apos;m mostly here because there &apos;s a kind of digging off the fish right now at the moment that we have on the one hand , which is that you have a dog <unk> , first through a set of rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; <unk> . &quot; and that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to be beaten .
no , we &apos;re going to do &quot; puppy , sit . &quot; -- boom , it can go after six to 10 .
they &apos;re like golden <unk> .
and i would say , if you don &apos;t need it , you might not have it .
it &apos;s not only with the pups , but also with the rest of the family .
these <unk> are so simple .
their children are simply to train .
wk : i want to make a windmill .
so , and that windmill -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i still think of energy with energy .
because even though i &apos;ve used scientific terms in songs , it &apos;s very hard to make it sound .
and less stressed , when it &apos;s accompanied by <unk> and <unk> , as in my case .
one is a white flash .
64 would be diagnosed with 75 pounds .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert was a mile or two a year .
the homo erectus formed the same tool over 30 generations .
you can train them in the lab to practice a little bit of practice , and there &apos;s actually a <unk> in other animals , but the exchange of a object is never going to happen .
it &apos;s the wealth ; it &apos;s the satisfaction of your own needs , time to save time .
we &apos;ve reached as a species .
but there &apos;s no evidence there .
and when people started making objects like this , this was a clue that a exchange between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a mouse ?
but that &apos;s me also because of the links that people are going to go , and the way that they have never been able to meet , and to mate , and i &apos;m sure that technology continue to continue to innovate , and that &apos;s why the doctrines are going to be more important .
that &apos;s as high as a <unk> building . i &apos;ve got the statue of liberty as comparison .
we don &apos;t talk about it , we don &apos;t take it seriously .
they &apos;re just gone , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
when we think about <unk> <unk> , then the rapid development is the problem , because how can we discover things that constantly change ?
i &apos;ve spoken -- you know , if you don &apos;t get a diagnosis in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we &apos;ve got one part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , but we &apos;re <unk> rhinoviruses .
after 10 extra days with a fever , she came back -- still -- it &apos;s got antlers -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it wasn &apos;t even very popular .
it &apos;s a classic retrovirus , but it &apos;s completely new . no one has ever seen it before .
a huge battery could do that .
let &apos;s do something that &apos;s going to be the <unk> of the <unk> .
i got a <unk> with low density , which is a <unk> with high chest pressure , and there was salt salt in between .
but david is young and clever , and he wants to build a <unk> , and so he builds up -- he &apos;ll build the first tube tube with this chemical composition .
so what do we have learned from all of this ?
this video was taken at princeton camp , six kilometers off the coast of <unk> <unk> , about 20 meters below the surface .
in fact , our garage quickly realized that our garage was not big enough for this growing project .
i started to be interested in maria <unk> and their methods , and how they found these <unk> and how important they found that kids discover things , and they didn &apos;t teach them to be able to be taught to them .
evolution is often seen as this one way we chose , but it &apos;s actually going to be a big array of opportunities .
i &apos;m going to go through this to the stage of scale .
our cities are endangered , because many of you are at the coast of the coast .
there are also stars and so forth .
so when we think about <unk> behavior or body , as it &apos;s called the social sciences , it &apos;s about language . we think about communication .
this phrase , even as pride as a pride , was studied by jessica tracy , and it showed that there were human beings and from birth to blind people , doing that if you were going to win a football game .
so i thought about it . you put it on these people and see how they felt . could you get them to do it , and would you be more supportive ?
what happens to a <unk> , what happens when you go on the <unk> stage ? how do the following little manipulation , that tiny <unk> ?
that &apos;s happening in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes . where can you apply that ? that &apos;s really important .
so , these things . people are kind of got to show their true ones . they &apos;re showing themselves .
she was completely depressed , and she said , &quot; i don &apos;t have anything to go . &quot;
you need your body , privacy and two minutes . it can impact the extra life in the big direction .
<unk> swimming in order to get to their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a ant , put it into the brain , and drive them up a blade of grass , like jeep .
and you have to have some kind of <unk> , you have to have an answer .
so it &apos;s like i think richard and myself care that these ideas are not going to be abused .
and of course , they are basically extinct .
but among all these ideas that are going to arise away from our technology in the entire world are a lot of toxic ideas .
and like , in viruses , we should not try to destroy them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called <unk> .
we put some ideas on the legs , we went international on tour .
i know you &apos;ll tell me , &quot; t don &apos;t exist in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody hears each other . nobody &apos;s familiar with the other .
you &apos;re going to see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m not suggesting that that should have happened , but that we need to be better if it &apos;s going to answer the questions that you have to consider when you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they work in <unk> . they &apos;re driver .
five dollars can save a life .
it &apos;s about two dollars a day , just a <unk> <unk> , and it tells me that they &apos;re not going to marry their children before these things are done .
finally , despair , they went and <unk> a wise old lady .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , when you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to be the best speech you ever want to do .
okay , the vast majority of us .
his message was basically oneness , the interconnectedness of everything and unity of everything . and his basic value was respect , kindness to strangers .
who fights while it &apos;s going on ?
they &apos;ve come to go in israel and palestine , in jordan , in syria , syria .
and so , more and more <unk> , and since recently , she &apos;s got a resource to support her family . . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
just go to somebody with a different culture , from another country , with a different country , which is kind of different , and i gave him a conversation ; listen to him .
i &apos;m going to start where the story starts , 1985 in <unk> .
this morning , before she <unk> , who had the opportunity to push ?
you see here -- 35 percent of these fewer famous houses where 50,000 indigenous people live , 35 percent of the homes had a job shower .
beverly percent of what we fix are from <unk> , things that actually have been installed out in fact .
we &apos;ve done that . it &apos;s <unk> .
and what we found was that , in this region , the main cause of disease and death .
one thing is what we did in the context of everything we did , in the middle of the <unk> said nelson mandela from here : &quot; how slavery and apartheid is poverty . it &apos;s the work of people , and it &apos;s the work of people .
i don &apos;t really care if you call me a <unk> . it really isn &apos;t .
it really sounds <unk> to say that from up here , but if you try to execute this , it &apos;s effective .
with that statement i &apos;m going to show you , in which belief that children don &apos;t have to rely on their community to live in a better manner .
this is the recent <unk> <unk> in america with our <unk> of bronx .
this is an image from the mayor of the bronx , the children in his house , not in prison , so they felt <unk> .
we gave something back .
when you get large kids with little <unk> , they &apos;re the great , thick man in the middle , which is cool , and they create these accountability under <unk> , which is incredible .
now you might be wondering about these kids .
if you look away from those shops .
stephen ritz : a teacher , which is the south bronx
second , i bet you &apos;ll see here as a spectrum here , here &apos;s a channel of concept right after this sharp line .
in 10 : <unk> , the pig was running a heart attack .
people with migraine who have a aura <unk> , have a band with <unk> neurons -- here in red -- that &apos;s three to five millimeters per minute .
the problem is that 30 million americans have migraine headaches , and we need a <unk> . i think we are now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> interface for epilepsy , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> acronym -- for treating other forms of paper .
lawyers spend on <unk> <unk> in hopes of <unk> , which splits the poor patients of the poor patients with pity .
and a year and a half ago , four from five of the <unk> at ushahidi , which by the way , by the way , called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
how do you know what &apos;s actually important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i got it the first time to bring it to here .
these people below the barrier i call <unk> , because they &apos;re actually going to get out of the process of sharing knowledge with the world .
they have used to use connexions as a platform to develop their <unk> and <unk> that are happening in <unk> countries around the world to teach teachers .
yes , books , maybe , maybe 100 or 1,000 spending are going to be sold in the year .
it &apos;s not surprising that it &apos;s all like that , isn &apos;t it ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so that &apos;s not very hard .
the days of <unk> are over , when people say , &quot; well , we &apos;d like to have three or <unk> of it in our country to see how that works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a few thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s kind of like an electronic book .
everybody says that &apos;s a $ 100 laptop , you can &apos;t do that .
and that &apos;s the <unk> .
they click on things and play on the screens . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better better way . &quot;
we &apos;re all playing &apos; &quot; i love lucy &quot; on a great <unk> , and we can &apos;t keep up with information .
thank you .
i think most people think that an hiv-positive mother , always their child .
that &apos;s not possible . that &apos;s not .
it &apos;s all good . they &apos;re going to live .
first of all , prevent <unk> .
two years ago , one of the mentor mothers came to me and told me a story .
how do you build a better healthcare system ?
the <unk> is just how easy the system is .
when you look at the volume of gray substance at four to 22 years , you &apos;ll take in your childhood , which is what this chart shows . it &apos;s <unk> in the early adolescence .
the idea that their father in the public is going to be running in the public , so she &apos;s got to go through it , so she &apos;s going to be a <unk> . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ;
this is the <unk> we built together .
after the first year , it was taken by the <unk> <unk> museum in austria to install it in his lobby , and i &apos;m happy to say that there stayed online , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years .
but in the night , as we were <unk> , i asked the <unk> , as the <unk> decided that they would kiss sam <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
it &apos;s a place where my family works for four generations .
in fact , i have no idea what it has to be with the smallest , but they &apos;re extremely <unk> .
the first thing you look at is the most beautiful force , the awful force of <unk> .
he put it around my leg , picks up me back up , brings me to a vehicle , and can bring me into a doctor .
it was a depression in the ground .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about them . &quot;
we calculate that 200 years from the end of our direct tort is the world .
it &apos;s so easy to see technology as a metaphor for memory , but our brains are not perfect <unk> like technology .
she &apos;s the <unk> of my toaster .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can tell you : corn is in everything .
you should know that in every community , the number of <unk> are already increasing .
i led three <unk> into antarctica .
but tell me where you &apos;re going to be and what country they belong to . &quot;
we also explored the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific .
and we &apos;re faced as the rest of the world in front of a problem .
it coined the term &quot; reverse <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> and the open sea was <unk> , but the <unk> that everybody liked to look at was in trouble .
here is the pacific , with enormous copper tape and gigantic <unk> .
now there &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> free for many of our devices , even on the smartphones .
it &apos;s an endless debate , and there &apos;s no conclusions , no one answer on it , but if you &apos;re a <unk> like me , you say , &quot; well , what &apos;s the data ? &quot;
instead , he &apos;s going to be very carefully documented , which is what happens when technology is for the first time in an environment and in a community .
so there &apos;s , of course , two different ways .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a yves <unk> painting .
i mean , that was at least , how it made me happy .
now , of course , there was a question that <unk> me a while in my mind : well , can i do more of the things that i &apos;d like to do in design , and less of those that i don &apos;t like to do ?
and here it is on the front of it .
they &apos;re faced with a horrible situation .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> in hospitals .
as an <unk> , for instance , i was viewed as an extraordinarily <unk> <unk> , because i knew the <unk> , and i know how i have to use <unk> , and i can work with the <unk> work .
i &apos;ve seen these worth of older people in so many of my friends who are in their 60s , &apos; 60s , and 90s , and 90s are still active as <unk> , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
as a christian <unk> , and made out of <unk> <unk> , the young jewish men in the u.s. and canada batman , and superman that are also attracted back to the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim <unk> of northern europe .
the biggest <unk> , <unk> , doesn &apos;t want these rocks to be <unk> . so he &apos;s trying to stop them at the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and when does the article come out ? &quot;
<unk> : it has to give something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 &quot; &#93; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous when a group of people identified themselves as extremely .
<unk> <unk> : from islam <unk> superheroes
let &apos;s look at it .
so let me highlight you for you .
so let me show you this .
and when i was working with the design , i found something curious about myself .
so you have the eye , and then the concepts come to .
but of course , china has a tremendous population .
but what that does show is that this kind of information is a form of information .
it &apos;s even a pleasure with them because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> has been named after the eden project in britain .
why doesn &apos;t it smell like potato or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and there &apos;s a theory that allows you to work less .
now , after several months of mine , i discovered that there &apos;s a kind of molecule called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same genus .
this is the basis of the device that these two people built by ford .
you &apos;ve created it ... and it &apos;s smell exactly like coumarin .
that was a good thing .
right now , there &apos;s a series of things that i want to pay you .
and she didn &apos;t really have a notion of the context that she showed up .
norman !
i didn &apos;t tell anybody on my mother , neither my mother , my father , not my sister , my brother , my cousins , my cousins , my grandparents , my grandparents , my grandparents , no .
i reports from that . i thought i just thought that i had two things when i left the orphanage i wanted to do . i was one to find my family , and the other thing was to write poems .
and that &apos;s how we look for them .
and then you hope that one of us there is going out there and there &apos;s little parts .
it had a <unk> , and it has to be <unk> by others , female and probably a lot of smaller family members to reach his age 12 years old .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation , or will it lead that we &apos;re going to be the free ways that exists on the planet ?
but are we going to do that , or are we going to put nature out of nature ?
one day , a couple of weeks or maybe a year later , i was with my <unk> in a shop for <unk> . i wanted to buy a <unk> -- we had a <unk> planned .
that meant a basic transformation for me .
so , my mask : about 70 layers of data , <unk> <unk> .
you want to know how obsessed i really am ? this project is just for me , and yet , i went so far on ebay to buy a chinese newspaper from san francisco in san francisco to be able to buy the bird .
when we moved to the <unk> blue mountains in the west of sydney , it was a perfect <unk> : sunshine , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you ever walk again , only with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember that my father got me out in the wheelchair , and i was on the top , and i was on the very first time , and i felt the sun on my face .
they said to me , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you beside them , because we think that &apos;s good for you . &quot;
she gave me the <unk> , and i called the school , i was laughing and said that i &apos;d like to give a <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mama and dad ? were never up on top .
i &apos;m in the world , but i &apos;m going to immerse myself .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> of a richard serra .
how the hell should i make a telephone in three weeks , if i have these things that have evolved over millions of years ?
each of these elements you could hang on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the highest lama in british .
i look at a little <unk> , and how they flow -- how they stretch and flow , it &apos;s based on furniture , but that &apos;s not the <unk> ; it &apos;s made of aluminum , as opposed to aluminum , as opposed to the aluminum , and it &apos;s grown .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
now , if you look at it next to contemporary architecture , it feels like i &apos;m sure of it .
that &apos;s my studio . it &apos;s underground .
it was made by kevlar .
immediately after i had done my dr. , i was fortunate enough to be a member of college , which uses him for the first time to study the ocean .
there was one of these <unk> .
it uses red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> to be able to look at animals that are blind to red light , and can you see it can be seen without being seen without being seen .
so they use it to find more and more partners .
i urge you to call them a different science , which is still hundreds of years old technology .
that &apos;s a magical place .
so i was looking at the value of the <unk> .
and at the fifth eg conference , i heard a noisy bang on the screen that changed my life and ended up with one duck .
and here are the cuts out again .
after the price , my life changed .
one more example of the <unk> of birds on the lives of birds .
so , for instance , if i like this -- this is the sound for purple .
i can listen to music , i can listen to the food and compose it .
one of them is &quot; i &apos;m a <unk> , &quot; by martin luther king , and the other is hitler .
you can see , you know , you can see that former <unk> are now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want oratory to be used to be used for you . &quot;
absolutely vital .
and what happens when teachers want to make order ?
and why not ? they don &apos;t trust the law . why don &apos;t you trust the law ?
it &apos;s that freedom is a <unk> structure .
because life is complex . and here &apos;s the most challenging and biggest transformation : we need to address the authority to the interpretation and the application of the crime .
a free society needs red and green lights , or it &apos;s going to be more complete gridlock .
<unk> boundaries for the interest that can compute for the revival that you can take .
now , if you think about it , it &apos;s really difficult round columns with a ruler .
he had a very bad job .
he had only had a <unk> .
but the problem , in terms of rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re doing the amount of activity on their own , and they <unk> the human activity in the 1930s .
so <unk> <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to imagine that any <unk> <unk> can sustain that for beck &apos;s time .
why did this idea of this idea ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was an extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to do something more concrete that we -- america and the rest of the world -- had that .
this was <unk> , the turtle .
we have this to do with a complete <unk> .
what i want to show you is what you &apos;re going to have to do to transport the <unk> uranium .
what if you had nuclear weapons ?
we come down and bring the truck to the truck you just saw somewhere here in <unk> .
part of the problem is that the <unk> itself , overwhelmed are driven by the idea of a nuclear catastrophe .
it was sent me from somebody who &apos;s a <unk> of <unk> , which is the fact that it had hard to do .
there are lots of black sheep out there that are doing the wrong things , and the problems have even more magical .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we tap into it ?
it &apos;s <unk> to have a dangerous work .
imagine if we could , because if we could do it , we could achieve more .
the governments that make most of the progress are the governments that found ways to be able to be able to be able to see in their business , rather than seeing the actor that &apos;s going to be the curious .
maybe i can look at that brain , and look at the brain , and i can change my cut .
i &apos;d like to thank it .
come to the 19th century , just to the 19th century , just to june in june in june .
we could certainly be so productive , if facebook or twitter would not cost us as much of the time .
they &apos;re clinging to the u.k. government to preserve money for building babbage &apos;s disease , because they believed that these machines would have tremendous practical effects for society .
it &apos;s not only enabled less affluent men , but they also <unk> them to look at the <unk> , rather than just answering <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned something about life .
once you start looking at the very little stuff -- that person has written a whole article and said , &quot; hey , that &apos;s bacteria . &quot;
and all of these are not old enough , they have no idea how that infection happened -- which is through that .
there are about 10,000 programs of trust .
this is the cadence you can find each of the 26 letters of the <unk> in one of randomly by random text of text .
anywhere where life is , you will have that distribution , as opposed to this distribution .
hot , too hot .
the cop says , &quot; are you sure ? hey , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost that ? &quot;
these are the data from one survey to the atacama desert in a single district in zambia , from a few years ago that i have <unk> .
as you can see , bruce willis was a lot more hair .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , when i was at any time , when i was in my plan , and i was not in the vacation .
instead of teaching people how to put the forms on the cell phones , we should develop software that allow them to do the self , without exercise and without my <unk> .
that &apos;s less than i was earned for two weeks when i was a consultant .
and then we understand that if we want to change our trajectory , in life or in the balloon , we need to change altitude .
that can be in spirituality .
and that &apos;s why they need <unk> .
i promised that i &apos;d fly around the world , if i fly around the world , not going to take a fuel , will be independent by fossil fuels , to be secure , not to be threatened by the <unk> .
i think you need a pilot in the aircraft that can talk to the universities who can talk to students who can talk to students who can talk to students during the flight , and it really can make it to a human adventure .
and what is the goal ?
that &apos;s why all the people who are engaged in these liabilities are welcome to be part of this team .
now you just need a laptop .
anyway , for us , africa was a magical place .
the next thing i want to create is what that problem is and what it isn &apos;t .
that &apos;s crazy , really if you think about it .
let &apos;s stop for a second .
the fact is that we are the first generation and this extreme poverty in the eyes , you see , look at the ocean , say it and i don &apos;t mean it . we don &apos;t have to stand .
it &apos;s on the nerves .
this year , a test is a test for us , specifically for the leaders of the <unk> states , which are <unk> .
the people find that .
and with this one campaign , as our screen , my organization , data , and other groups have the energy and the enthusiasm of hollywood to the united of hollywood to the <unk> of america .
step forward you step forward , a nurse , a teacher , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet , which has changed all of their lives to change a country -- and a continent that &apos;s just making it so analog , let alone -- it leaves me the head .
lips are not lips , but volcanoes .
your task is to identify what these shapes are bouba and which is kiki .
now , if you &apos;re not <unk> , then this sentence , literally &apos;s going to be wrong .
if we can solve a problem or something new , we compare that what we already know about what &apos;s unknown to us .
nadia <unk> : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they don &apos;t fit to all these representations .
pm : i don &apos;t think that .
how are you thinking about it , you personally , but also with your <unk> ?
some of my reporters are arrested .
that &apos;s clearly a different image of yemen .
my heart was going to be too big .
this is a list list : if you look too much salt , like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , then you &apos;ll end up in love with the <unk> .
but soon i had symptoms for <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , knowing that i would probably never see my home .
i was sitting there talking about the <unk> for life , and i asked him what i was when i needed a transplant , to do it .
i was on a dozen machines that kept me living .
thank you .
and interestingly , one of these <unk> is also in the u.s. by 200 percent of them in the united states .
and also , it &apos;s also interesting that the same company that sold us 80 million pounds , the &quot; <unk> , &quot; but the same company is going to sell the same company -- a and the same company .
we also started as <unk> .
what would our <unk> children tell us when they got back again : now i had a little <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and a little <unk> a.
the problem is you &apos;re in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , that connection is not going to see that connection in most of our villages .
here you see this slide show at the <unk> <unk> next to the airport of los angeles .
i offered five cents for each <unk> .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> ; it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the spread of <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that looks at the foot of a elephant , and the biggest part of them remains them .
they look out of their <unk> and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
redwoods have a huge surface that &apos;s expanding in the sky because it turns into something that &apos;s called <unk> -- repetition .
<unk> give rise to the <unk> , just like a cathedral , and help the tree to live longer .
it &apos;s totally <unk> to see that .
but recently , all the doors are torn up to the <unk> and break the walls .
that was 25 years ago .
let &apos;s take a look at first of all , for example , first of all .
how do these guys make money with these infected computers ?
and they can afford to watch how we work -- how <unk> work -- and trying to find a way of finding a way , the <unk> we &apos;re meeting .
you &apos;re going to be able to see that you can see there &apos;s a <unk> : <unk> / d / d / d / d and if you open your computer on your computer , and you &apos;ve got this program .
and if you look at the pictures of the scene , you can see that the mark of the mercedes-benz is <unk> .
we need to find any way to make sure that all work , even when the computers are .
but i didn &apos;t have anything to do that .
this person is dealing with consultants .
why should we think what he says ? &quot;
what &apos;s the future ?
these forces completely wiped out , nobody <unk> that .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and they would take this kind of calculation and they would join this kind of calculation , because it would change things , but it would change things in two ways .
what that means is that we can see a copy itself , if you &apos;ve only used a part of the energy output , which is occurring in slow motion and <unk> .
and the happy few , jill and kevin ? well , she came back from her <unk> and saw that her video was suddenly prevalent like a <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go to the distance .
that &apos;s what he was taught to do when he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a mentor , which was how to give me how to browse .
what is it that you spend in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what are you going to do with what you &apos;re going to do with you and you put it in ?
didn &apos;t have the -- i didn &apos;t have the -- technique . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right managers . i didn &apos;t have ...
at that moment , consciously or subconsciously . in the moment where you <unk> , you can focus on something , you can give them a meaning and whatever it means , it &apos;s worth emotion .
have you ever done something , and then you go , &quot; that was me ! &quot;
in death . so , god in his endless wisdom gave us another human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , through friendship , through evolutionary , through evolutionary in nature .
and there are seven different errors . i can &apos;t go through it because i &apos;m through . the last element is feeling .
as man in the occupied area , in the <unk> area , had died in new york , if he had been on the day at work , and this man who wanted to be a terrorist , and it was very clear .
instead , i &apos;m interested in designing tools that a large number of people can tell their stories , people all over the world .
the color of particles corresponds to the kind of <unk> -- happy , positive colors .
we &apos;re looking at , &quot; i feel like i was on the computer all day long . &quot;
and when i go over here , the list starts to run , and there are thousands of feelings that have been collected .
the 10 issues spread out and circling the temperature .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : unveiling of our modern mythology . &quot;
we can click on this , and see this iconic image image of betty ford , as she throws her husband &apos;s husband &apos;s husband .
you can also look at quotes , if you like to read quotes to climate change .
so , people are clouds as something that &apos;s in ways .
they started in life today . it &apos;s got tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries in the entire world .
you only need one step out of going out , and you pay attention to that , which is so banal , so banal that everyone else will overlook it .
so they look up , admire them the magic beauty , and think about it to carry the head into the clouds .
that would have 25,000 recordings that would have done that : &quot; <unk> , good , good . &quot;
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> . it was a huge machine .
these images came from a virtual autopsy .
you can see the knife in the heart of the heart .
it &apos;s a small , toxic pen , which is very , very fast <unk> .
now this is a really interesting project .
so he &apos;s doing it .
so , very skilled people .
i went to the kids as many as possible , to bring the academic stuff with the real world .
it &apos;s not all , but it &apos;s an incredibly embarrassing summary of everything we know about the basic nature of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details why we imagine the universe , but it &apos;s going to be out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
and over the course of my career , there &apos;s always something inside me .
in 2001 , i went to see her as a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this is the last degree of the last degree of 2004 .
he &apos;s about a degree degree ago , and it was filmed with somebody who you all know about .
every one is going to be a <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be a different scientific discipline .
i got my first computer as a teenager in accra , and it was a really wonderful device .
he explores the brain using mri , and he said this is the most beautiful brain that he ever undertook .
the next few slides i &apos;ll tell you that briefly .
they &apos;re getting smaller to allow that , and that has made our technology quite much better .
now , our <unk> is right there , right there .
i had such a gut that we were doing it wrong .
so in that sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
we can see more detail in our galaxy than somewhere else .
and that brings us a factor of 20 .
so there was a bunch of alternative to the notion that there was a supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could put lots of stuff out there .
it draws a lot more than on the other hand than the other and the cloud gets broken apart .
and i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you that we have a really supermassive black hole in the center of the galaxy .
i was walking in the streets of new york , and i saw some kids between stairs , cars and foreign baseball play .
so , for example , the people in the 11th century pieces that were like that .
in the first eight centuries of these tradition , the great &quot; what &quot; in it is to recycle and prices .
over new and better instruments broke the age of <unk> .
but a question remains : what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and feelings over time
so we &apos;re so at the dawn of a new <unk> .
by 1945 , they took it to 100,000 per year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , even though i don &apos;t know where to start .
wow , a volunteers , great !
but recently , my interest was inspired by a new view of great research , because there are conditions where these things can make something really cool .
well , i think this is the <unk> development of a phenomenon that we call &quot; neonurture innovation . &quot;
but the element of desire is really the most important .
we &apos;re going to get a great deal of them back .
now , let me introduce you to this point of sam <unk> .
but even if you look at the screen , it &apos;s going to be much more than words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
it &apos;s how global innovation functions .
first of all , i have to give a service to the audience , and talk about what i &apos;m going to give him , instead of telling what i can &apos;t offer .
and they &apos;re fun to design their own ultimate or the worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they hold them alive , and they give them the sugar , as sort of a <unk> , which we call superpower .
these kinds of tests do that , ok ?
somebody asked , &quot; why ? &quot;
and he thought he could reverse the waves . he didn &apos;t .
i think there are three major changes , in the areas of transparency , the choice and <unk> where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my favorite , sharon <unk> , let me say , all over the world there are more pictures of your head than anyone else .
eleven from 14 countries .
and secondly , teachers looked at the <unk> and <unk> as an ecologist <unk> , because they assumed in particular areas where there is an awful lot of value .
so i wish i &apos;d like to give you a nice weekend .
reading and writing and writing , it &apos;s getting easier and cheaper .
<unk> work alone .
now you might be wondering , &quot; what would i do in a <unk> ? &quot;
when you have all over the world such a <unk> , it can lead to a <unk> device , which allows you to be doing biotechnology .
the kingdom of that , his laws allow him , strangers <unk> , or <unk> , which represent an economic risk or a risk of health care or a risk of health .
these laws are a blow into the face of science and based on prejudice and the ignorance and a <unk> of traditions and a <unk> .
why are you going pregnant when you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 members of people who inject drugs .
so that social , the condoms , are attracted by the police , not even by the police , or <unk> or randomly imprisoned .
and there were children born there , people died there .
models for personal work are already obsolete .
you &apos;ve taken the high line , the road <unk> , the river beneath the road , and you get from a end to the other , without crossing the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
it should be shared .
their liver generates oil absorbent oil .
and they killed by the 12,000 sharks at the time , by just putting a <unk> from the <unk> in <unk> bay on achill island .
we know very little about them .
so this tags is going to be the place of a shark , depending upon the time and the sunset , the temperature and deep .
so let &apos;s look at the <unk> , which is what &apos;s going on with the genes that are passed by the parents , we see that basking sharks compared to the first trial , one by less of 10 less diversity than others .
so <unk> came up with this research and found that the height is about 9,000 .
and what was okay . we got wet . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can tell the gender of the shark before we can take a sample , we can tell the geneticists if it was from a male or female .
so i decided to give the announcement myself .
their bodies are being used by <unk> , and they &apos;re wired to be used for any <unk> to make money -- people tell a lot of these stories .
don &apos;t do business with no business .
now my journalism may not fit on other continents or in other countries , in my part of africa , but it &apos;s going to work with corruption , and people immediately ask , &quot; where are the evidence ?
aa thank you .
i was raised in downtown manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be a <unk> <unk> .
and had these people ever met a victim of their <unk> ?
now , in 29 states , you can in 29 states in more than half of the country , because of its sexuality <unk> .
in fact , i understood that my mission to photographing &quot; gay , &quot; because there was a million of the different <unk> of gay .
at least i hope that it &apos;s difficult to anticipate their human rights .
first of all , the world is , and it &apos;s always been good and evil , because good and evil , yin and yang are <unk> .
and thirdly , i had access to all the 1,000 pictures that had made the soldiers .
in three ways , the prevailing kind of means .
this is stanley <unk> , a jewish boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the holocaust age , here ? &quot;
&quot; my lord , who is responsible when something happens ? &quot;
stanley <unk> , and i said both , by the way , both of the high school , at the james <unk> in the bronx <unk> in the bronx .
so , here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity .
<unk> of others . <unk> of the self .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil by the heart of each person .
and i posted the experiment the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everyone could do , &quot; no big thing to jump on the tracks .
it &apos;s a mystery that was really hard to reject .
we have a self .
but on my left retina is a <unk> , which is <unk> by the red arrow .
there &apos;s only one <unk> , which is the body .
i promise that i didn &apos;t say anything about it , except that it &apos;s going to be scary .
and the autobiographical self has augmented memory , thinking , imagination and language .
thank you . thank you for hip-hop -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m going to tell you this -- i tell you about it and <unk> , because i think the feminism is part of the task , admitting that aesthetic , and beauty and fun matter .
we don &apos;t want a heroine .
you &apos;ve got to have , i didn &apos;t put myself on fire .
she talked about <unk> , she started <unk> , she organized organized , she <unk> friends -- all this everyday actions of caring and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this <unk> , which is the homo sapiens of the previous parts of earlier .
in fact , this is a sensor that reads the electrical activity in my brain , while i think that talk .
we &apos;ve got a lot of prototypes and products that you can control with thoughts , like <unk> appliances , or a <unk> chair .
the headset is connected to wireless with a ipad or smartphone .
and as these kids can use their new awareness to their transformation , many of the <unk> and most <unk> social <unk> , which people who are diagnosed as a disease , is to see themselves . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt
she understood the power of human narrative , and that the value that we &apos;re dealing with is changing , changing and growing .
and said , &quot; how do you celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities .
and so , very unexpectedly , they put them on .
this one was not focusing on to look at my eyes .
i was running a track that i know very well .
and very , very slowly it happened .
i didn &apos;t really believe in myself , not really , not to all the joints of me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole .
what we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but in one of them , they feel great , and at the other hand , with only one small change in the memory , they feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that needs to happen , which is about the amount of control , which we have about our motivations .
for <unk> percent of this money you could have install <unk> in the trains , which is not the duration of journey , but what the pleasure and the fears would have improved .
i &apos;m not asking for the full burden of one of the other things about the other .
sometimes the lines are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is the fact that the field of consciousness is known as <unk> discipline of human psychology .
would the average answer to 50 to 60 percent .
it &apos;s going to tell you that they don &apos;t hurt themselves , other others .
chimborazo !
they &apos;re going to be 20 , 30 years .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i have a coin with head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our <unk> of the visible universe .
thank you .
with hyperscore , we had , actually , very strong effects of children all over the world , and now at humans every age .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
hi . my name is dan <unk> . i &apos;m 34 years old and i &apos;ve got <unk> .
this is actually the score of <unk> &apos;s piece that he was completely <unk> in hyperscore .
he would have said , &quot; well , let &apos;s do a <unk> .
so there &apos;s the present self first .
i have to write five pages a day for article , or i had to give up five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last <unk> machine , is something that i created with hal <unk> , which was made me from my coauthor at a previous project , bill <unk> .
so , it &apos;s quite good that it &apos;s not about people , because when one of the faces hits the faces , the other face looks like .
this is one of the reasons that as much of what we think for western science , math and <unk> , actually in the first few centuries of our <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
x is the unknown because there &apos;s no sh &quot; sh . &quot;
it &apos;s not surprising that if you talk about mental illness , you &apos;re likely to hear stories of <unk> suffering , shame and discrimination in almost all of life .
a little more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world was in <unk> and gave this legendary explanation .
what &apos;s it about ?
if you look at the stage of the species , you &apos;ve heard of the fish .
if you look at these profits , you &apos;ll see that almost 8,000 of these dollar is actually subsidy .
this was in the early 1930s , when india was going to <unk> his <unk> , as a result , as a result -- after china with his <unk> growth of eight , nine , 10 percent , and wondered , why can we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t fit in a happy situation , but they have faith and the courage to say , <unk> and say , &quot; we have calculated .
so , carbon , that emissions through deforestation and agriculture , and blue carbon together , together , 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what those things don &apos;t mean , including , by the way , by the way , by the way .
i also liked these intellectual <unk> .
and he said he had basically exactly the same relationship with his father .
there was a theory .
he did it in 1968 .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t move at the end of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we removed the whole thing , and the <unk> color , which just <unk> that simple <unk> .
a lot of these ideas put into the built trailers for airstream .
when you think about your children to the tinkering school , you will come back with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let &apos;s play them under their own conditions , and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that they cannot learn from the <unk> .
if you want to throw a device next time , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all . this is number one . okay .
so here &apos;s the sick knee on the left on the left , and here &apos;s my wife today , four months after , and in good engineering .
how do you think of it with a completely <unk> <unk> , not only the parts ?
this is one of the seven stories that they weren &apos;t going to be in all the time .
and so , in <unk> <unk> , there was a lot of west africa to buy the first one , then hundreds of thousands , and then hundreds of thousands of people would be able to print one in the middle of the hell of the hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
as a edison , it looked like this .
you have to be quite clever , and even though i don &apos;t have any <unk> , it doesn &apos;t mean i &apos;m stupid , because you can &apos;t be stupid , and you can get it in the world .
they literally pushed us the door .
when you listen to your <unk> listening , both your ears are both speaker .
we have the problem that the antenna is <unk> .
so thank you very much .
and that &apos;s why i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently i &apos;ve created some rather sophisticated <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
and i drew your own special card , and writing your name on it , and she wrote her name on it .
i &apos;m sure i can see how you <unk> .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s <unk> , my precious and limited life on this earth is actually <unk> .
in this mode , he &apos;s trying to keep his position .
i thought i &apos;d tell you a little bit about how nature makes possible .
and let &apos;s think of future technologies . we start at the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you see the amino acids with the <unk> where you have different charges .
and through a series of <unk> , you can be one of a billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you can see <unk> coming out .
when you ask people the question : where do they go , if they do something important ?
i used my desk on my desk , i used my expensive computer .
what happens -- sometimes you have those days where you wake up at eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or when you &apos;re up in the morning , or when you &apos;re up , and you say , &quot; man , i didn &apos;t sleep well .
in the office , most ponds , and distractions that people actually hold their work from work , <unk> .
we all know that that &apos;s true . they would never have a <unk> meeting that is <unk> .
so , and so on and managers are the two main problems in companies , especially in offices .
maybe every two weeks , or every week , once the week , <unk> that nobody can talk to .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;ll do this already seven years , and i have no idea what the future is going to look like .
but if you ask people to the three most important things that they &apos;re wearing , no matter what culture and what context -- say most people : give money , money , and if you own one , the cell phone .
but , and this is a very large , but we &apos;ve forgotten the trend .
now , i want to give you a practical example of delegation .
they take 10 or 20 percent , and then -- the owner of the song takes 10 or 20 percent or 20 percent or 20 percent of the time , and there &apos;s the rest of my family to my family .
it &apos;s called the norm .
and it &apos;s kind of an recognition recognition for the values .
at the same time with the spread of these mobile devices , we see an expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;ll tell about it later .
what did we just talk about ?
so , <unk> <unk> presents with us new findings that show how the <unk> neighborhoods can impact a human plane , say that if we live healthier , if we live healthier , exercise and more love , our brain cells , and more loved ones , our brain cells .
until i tell you who said it .
within that context , we can feel regret about a lot of different things .
when i went home , after i got home , after i got my tattoo , i almost threw the entire night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s one fifth .
i mean , even the stupid answer to all &quot; <unk> can leave us back in <unk> .
and as i said earlier , i &apos;m a <unk> .
i thought i was going to try and get to my ted wish , what i &apos;m trying to achieve , and how that matches what you &apos;re trying to do .
it &apos;s not in india . now , there are at least half a million active .
and i came up with the idea that somebody in this entire animal world is thinking about the organization of <unk> .
and so we decided to do that .
now listen to that : less than four tenth of one percent of the people who have been treated , the <unk> of their medicines or <unk> in their own treatment .
it &apos;s worth trying to do it , and i think it &apos;s successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
when the sailors is used , it will create 8,000 watts of electricity . day and night .
and people bring their greens together , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
so from balinese women cook the food on <unk> , and they use secrets that are only aware of their grandmothers .
we need somebody who &apos;s coming and this .
the green school is a model we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and vocal were still healthy and <unk> . &quot;
then apple alex , the best voice i &apos;ve heard of .
there was a reason for that : that was me .
the <unk> is not natural .
but that &apos;s not about that .
at first , the internet was a <unk> tool . now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m going to do for my real life , daily life .
it &apos;s human to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the resources .
i was an architect , and my grandmother would ask me , &quot; what are you living ? &quot;
we treated two <unk> pages than one only page , because this is how the readers come true .
so what &apos;s the lesson behind that ?
but one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;ve got it .
it <unk> and horrible things happened with me .
everybody lost the hope in my cure .
so they went to their <unk> , and they all collected their <unk> furniture -- they gave me temperature and <unk> , <unk> , everything .
you don &apos;t know how far away that road is , and you don &apos;t know if you walk straight and you &apos;re going to listen to cars , and you have a terrible accident that you put in that situation .
i thought for some reason for some reason for some reason for some reason for some reason , and only for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say we would have discovered all the symmetries of the alhambra ?
i can &apos;t turn it off because i have a little hurdle , right ?
when i <unk> a magical train , and then you get one , you get a third one .
galois have set up a series of law , like these tables , these symmetries .
one of these symmetry we call <unk> .
instead , all the clutter , i want to know how many places the number has the number . ok ?
i need your last name . symmetrical objects have basically -- please enjoy it for me .
one : worse diet , maybe shorter <unk> .
thomas edison would have been very <unk> in a software company today .
it was discovered in 1928 , but even in 1940 , there were no commercial and psychological useful amounts of them .
it was the origin of <unk> , which was last year &apos;s 50th birthday .
and for me , the lesson of unintended consequences is that chaos happens . let &apos;s do the best thing .
it &apos;s every computer and browser . minus , minus , minus and the text is smaller .
they don &apos;t need to put it extra .
and so this is a kind of technique that i &apos;m inspired by that , my real desk .
a means that would be like a <unk> , so you would again get the rather traditional desktop printer . things are used by grid .
now , with my music , the hearts of people , and there &apos;s no boundaries anymore .
but i think that &apos;s the point , it &apos;s metaphors with the bite , and with such a comment i want to suggest today that we &apos;re going to be looking at the role of contemporary mathematics a little bit about -- not only <unk> , but math in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there are 2,000 physicists at wall street , and i &apos;m one of them .
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that you might have on amazon acres .
these are not <unk> ; that &apos;s culture .
you can get it very , very long .
and it &apos;s not the money that actually is so interesting .
here we go . shake . okay .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , intersections with no traffic control , so with <unk> , saving many lives , but there &apos;s an awful lot of them .
and the answer is to allow cars from this side of the road .
warren buffett did this : honestly to say what works and what doesn &apos;t and it &apos;s going to be a annual thing to do .
in fact , what we &apos;re seeing is the only known disease is that it &apos;s the only known disease because of living things in africa , in fact , living things up to the <unk> .
what that means is that the economy in these areas , because it just sunk so much .
but that doesn &apos;t give us any <unk> .
it &apos;s not only weak ; it &apos;s going to be weaker .
a teacher by the top quartile , the performance of his class -- measured by greenhouse gas emissions -- in one year by 10 percent .
but there &apos;s no relationship to being a better teacher .
&quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and these free robots , not only could be available on the internet , but you can also make dvds everywhere , so that everyone with access to one <unk> can have the best teachers .
<unk> containers , like this cup , takes eight to 10 hours to burn .
the sculptor of richard serra talks about how he thought as a young artist , he was a painter and he lived in florence .
when i look at these pictures , i <unk> the smoke on my clothes when i went home to my family .
and my parents said great . they said , &apos; we know that you are afraid , but let &apos;s just go tomorrow .
but is it so bad to keep us so powerful ?
this is a general general general issue in boston .
the pathologist takes the sample , <unk> it , it <unk> it , it <unk> it underneath the microscope , and then informed the operating room .
so in this mine , it &apos;s a solution with these <unk> molecules , with a dye , here in green , <unk> into the <unk> of one , can &apos;t actually separate tissue of these molecules .
with <unk> lymph nodes , as part of our today &apos;s <unk> , the surgeon , the lymph nodes , the lymph node where the cancer begins .
if nerves are damaged , they can cause paralysis , and pain .
if we <unk> these two samples ...
we know that this is doable , and we &apos;re determined to realize that .
and this cell is one of the thousand different constructs that we &apos;re learning .
it &apos;s going to influence the healthy circuitry of the way the sick people who want to fix them .
and one morning in the summer in 2004 , we tried it , and it was happening for the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already , a short view of these cells is going to be able to do learning .
and it &apos;s going to go . now .
i want to end with a story of what we think it might be a clinical application .
now , you can see that the animal actually goes into the walls and the little platform of his eyes .
buildings are colonized with the air , <unk> microbes floating through the windows and using mechanical meats .
and when you stop out there , the air is microbes that are going to be associated with <unk> and <unk> .
obviously , i am a very strong person , as you can see , so i didn &apos;t worry about putting this thing 20 blocks .
the same is true of the question of , after 9 / 11 , the streets of the neighborhood was living in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things i &apos;ve been experimenting with is something called google share , basically , you just take a abstract term and look at google after google , and then you look at these results after the name of somebody .
this is britney <unk> . i mean , ok , interesting .
when you have the second page here , you add most of them .
what was normal for us all 40 years -- the story of stories between generations -- is now rare .
in 1939 , the film is older than most grandparents of our members .
did the story tell us ?
why don &apos;t we see that as the same passions as that read ?
in california , they &apos;re going to be withdrawn with a <unk> : &quot; this product includes chemicals that are going to be as an equivalent of cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so maybe we could develop a 3d scan that needs humility , and for my career as an architect , it &apos;s a curious that the words &quot; humility &quot; and &quot; architect &quot; since &quot; the timeless olympics since &quot; the timeless olympics since &quot; the timeless olympics . &quot;
i don &apos;t know if you remember your answer , but it was like , &quot; the stone didn &apos;t get off because the stones are dropped out . &quot;
and that can be very appropriate for berlin , but we put it in the houston , and all the windows are closed . and with all the products that obviously have not been touched for the use of <unk> , it &apos;s actually a vertical <unk> .
when we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of them are using it .
since then we &apos;ve taken the 4,000 , most of the most successful <unk> in a database that we &apos;re going to be able to put in six weeks in the public at six weeks of the public .
now we &apos;re going to learn 160 pounds of <unk> <unk> on the internet .
we started to paste commercial and build buildings , so that all people have centers and places where they can stop .
and this is the <unk> <unk> in utah .
and that &apos;s not true . don &apos;t let anyone tell you that we already knew all that already knew because we didn &apos;t know .
so , for example , at microsoft &apos;s time , at microsoft at the 11th of september 11th , at yahoo at the 12th of march , and then the other one : google , facebook , skype , apple , apple and so on .
i chose sweden because sweden was similar laws like the united states .
and whoever else told you , he didn &apos;t have anything to hide about it long enough .
their email were read , and she spoke in the <unk> , and she said , &quot; if there &apos;s no law on privacy , there can &apos;t make any difference , and therefore there can &apos;t be an effective democracy . &quot;
many people , if you look at the first time a fresh human brain , say , &quot; usually it looks differently if you give a brain . &quot;
all of these empty areas are the areas that travel through .
and the nature of a particular cell , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of <unk> biochemistry , which is what the 25,000 genes are switched upon and to which threshold they are turned on .
now there are experts coming into play , and we make some basic anatomical <unk> .
we take it out of material material and put it on a so-called <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genome and they &apos;re trying to find targets that are linked to the genes .
whether it &apos;s from the individual genetic background or your experiences , we don &apos;t know .
we know how to compose poverty , we just have to do more for that ?
so here are a couple more questions .
how can you know ?
so what &apos;s the problem ?
all right , all right .
and there were lots of experiments that came to the same result , so i &apos;m going to just tell you about one .
so what &apos;s the best thing ?
we need this kind of information . we need more of it . and we need to steer politics .
and maybe we &apos;re going to start small , with things where we are certain they are .
poverty to statistically is more <unk> than scientific work and a lack of data about the impact of <unk> <unk> the question of how to put these sticks , but <unk> esther duflo , it &apos;s possible to figure out which is <unk> , which damage -- with <unk> studies .
so we start , because africa is , in a certain way , in the conflict .
and the legend reported that alexander walking through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t move . &quot;
so we look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk to this from the perspective of <unk> .
in tanzania , the last week of the standard <unk> was invented in life .
if i had to ask you , &quot; what was the average wage in 2005 , the world &apos;s population ? &quot; would you think of egypt on egypt ?
because there are fascinating possibilities .
&quot; god &quot; is the journey that we all want to be inspired and to feel one with the universe , which is the life of life .
you <unk> a switch -- there &apos;s electrical light .
i don &apos;t know why , but they thought .
i &apos;m going to leave that to you , so that you can kind of take it , and i &apos;m going to describe my reactions as i first saw that for the first time .
that &apos;s exactly true .
ok , you switch , raise your right hand .
kt : yes .
kt : no , no . i just look at the road .
i couldn &apos;t see through the blindfold .
again , back .
kb : how often have you felt that ?
let &apos;s put your eyes in five , four , three , two , one .
it &apos;s only when you want the pressure to go , you make a <unk> , like , but only if you want the pressure to be released .
do you want to try it ?
you know , you feel a particular sensation , and if you feel emotion , i want you to throw it into the bottle .
there &apos;s one thing i want to share with you .
ready ?
my hand is , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . do you think it &apos;s here , yes or no ?
first of all , let &apos;s look at barry barry : how our brain can hold our bodies -- with a trick of it . then he &apos;s using the audience in some <unk> <unk> of dung .
i &apos;m going to immerse myself on . i &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; d.
it &apos;s not for the &quot; one of four . &quot; that &apos;s for all four .
i observed that both religious and <unk> people are obsessed equally by morality .
the <unk> is almost at zero , if there &apos;s no stimulation to the <unk> .
they get the news from the computer , &quot; person one has sent them that lot of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is about 80 percent efficiency by 80 percent .
i just found the molecule .
he said to me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experiments , we have men of people .
that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new pair of emotional .
and it &apos;s very easy to put a brain on the surface of the brain .
in order to run the device , you need a lot of people , a lot of people .
or should they do that ?
they said , &quot; you &apos;ve given us a machine , which is just in english , so we &apos;ve taught ourselves to ourselves , so we can use it to be able to use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument by making a geographic statement .
pain . but i had to follow the youngest norm .
how will tomorrow be tomorrow ?
we have to undo this imbalance , from a threat to pleasure .
i think that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s going on here .
i &apos;ve questioned quite incredible questions -- &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will she end ? &quot; -- to nine-year-olds .
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece because i &apos;ve lost the thread .
<unk> went to the local <unk> in uttar pradesh and found that he had been run into the official <unk> as a police officer .
that &apos;s why that area is <unk> .
<unk> is in the privileged layer , which is able to pay several <unk> and lots of homes , common .
after those four children , you see <unk> younger sister who are also killing their kids who were also killed .
and then finally , there was a single person who sat down for me , and he later found his participation , so i had to <unk> him so that it &apos;s <unk> .
with 16 , the children leave the orphanage to leave the orphanage , even though they can &apos;t go anywhere .
one of the interesting things is the combination of the naked hand on the instrument and the technique , and of course , what he said about listening to our young people .
now , my career might continue a little longer .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
from him , it &apos;s the sound of the sound .
or we &apos;re doing this , and we think that &apos;s what blindness is .
democracy . not bad . bad .
so , if i study a piece of music , but why can i do that if i study a piece of music ?
so in this pinwheel <unk> , the dove <unk> evelyn tells evelyn , why hear about music is much more prevalent than sound to his rays .
and it became so big , until the point where it was a <unk> last year at <unk> &apos;s thanksgiving , and rick <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> &quot; millions of people on tv .
but that &apos;s not the interesting thing .
cp : you have been fortunate that it &apos;s not live to you .
compassion and love were mentioned .
cp : yeah , but you still don &apos;t know what to think about it .
that &apos;s 10 times longer than the mammals needed to reach their maximum height and to conquer all of these habitats .
we &apos;re very similar to the dinosaurs , and we &apos;re very unusual in our <unk> attitude .
in fact , it &apos;s a country that didn &apos;t have access to the beginning of our work .
this is a brand <unk> in his jaw .
paul hasn &apos;t seen an arts as yet .
these are all <unk> . there &apos;s a series of opportunities .
i became an artist and i started drawing .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been looking for this question for centuries -- how do you work these kids on science .
bad news for derartu tulu had spent the same idea , underneath the <unk> <unk> and paula radcliffe , which is a complete deal , with distance the fastest <unk> of all time .
show me an animal with <unk> and gills , it &apos;s got to do with water .
we don &apos;t have our physical strength , because we are the biggest ones in the <unk> .
now , emily <unk> -- one of 500 <unk> and <unk> -- she ends up at the eighth level , under the best 10 , even though she had done all the <unk> to satisfy her baby -- and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s all we could .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
let &apos;s put the focus on those <unk> where you have failed , if you need four hours .
it was always about trying to interact with things , not with people -- with certainty -- certainly not in a social way that would be , of course , for us and really help the people to accept robots as part of our everyday lives . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that monster is very , very evil .
the <unk> was a flip of our group where they used three one from three different technologies to interact with the people .
and with this technology , you can become the active participant in life in your life , in a way that it isn &apos;t possible today .
and the third possibility was a simple diary with paper and pen , because that &apos;s the <unk> that normally happens when you start a <unk> and <unk> .
another important idea is this notion of the <unk> <unk> of the character .
i looked like , &quot; well , look very hard , because it &apos;s not going to go , &quot; it &apos;s not going to be heard , but <unk> &apos; n . &quot;
it &apos;s not going to go . i fire , &quot; bang ! &quot; of the <unk> , between two <unk> cars .
when he wrote on a <unk> , i was in front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do <unk> , books and a little bit of advertising , all with the same concept .
now , from the photography , this <unk> , they make desire and <unk> . what you can &apos;t have , you want to do more .
as she moves into collective consciousness , without realizing that we know that , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very commercially .
and then you take the picture that he shoots , and suddenly it &apos;s going to be quite serious and perhaps less available .
eighty-five percent of the global burden of disease are in the developing world -- not in the west -- and yet , 90 percent of the resources in the west .
just treat it . look at the shoes in mauritius .
but when you tell them , well , we &apos;re trying to do the same in nigeria , and then all the time .
it allows the existence of <unk> centers , and we can use the experience of very clever .
if you have to be part of the solution -- that &apos;s important us .
and we begin to do a <unk> technical program , so that we were able to involve local people that could fix the equipment .
it has a very large range of very massively -- the child doesn &apos;t develop language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
and i love the film , how all of you have my projects . that &apos;s the grandmother in me .
now , what i learned was , because i wasn &apos;t so distressed to sell my work and not myself .
another thing is the sensory problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of the equipment is <unk> .
it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
i did <unk> during the ted meeting , and i created things and learned how to do tasks .
another very <unk> idea is to leave the kids from some of the many <unk> <unk> of history .
tg : i have passion for the things that i do to make the world better .
it &apos;s a augmented reality that can track projections and systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i stand at this coast , the <unk> <unk> i &apos;m going to look out on the far horizon , and i think , again , that i will be able to do it all the way across the high , dangerous wilderness of a ocean .
but it was deeper : how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our <unk> that you never really tell me how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but very honestly , all of these talk that i had <unk> , just to go through the <unk> , and they were very different .
thank you very much and a lot of fun at the conference .
and that &apos;s perhaps the <unk> , he lost his self-esteem .
he closes the army . the army gives him a rifle .
so what happens when a medium happens to all of new ideas in circulation ?
they had to synchronize rapidly what other philosophers knew , but you couldn &apos;t have the right kind of argument .
but there was a programmer who decided that that wasn &apos;t the best way of work .
each of you can do changes , and you can do it for <unk> labor , even if you haven &apos;t knew anything from the existence of each other before .
this is called a &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing on the right .
something ultra-low-cost that can happen to a culture is that you can acquire a new <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right ?
don &apos;t you do what others do to improve a little bit , because that doesn &apos;t bring it very far .
and when someone tells you that you can &apos;t do it , you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months of time .
but we &apos;ve tested these rovers , before we put them there -- or that one rover -- and made sure that everything works .
so we &apos;ve sent a spacecraft on the way to mars , it &apos;s called phoenix . this spacecraft &apos;s going to land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so they can ask their views .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re in this way , as we speak here , the next rover that we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you in the last time that these airbags are really cool stuff .
there were two <unk> that were particularly interested in us .
it &apos;s like the cycle on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be water , because water is frozen .
today i want to talk to you about how these exponentially growing growing technologies .
so , let &apos;s look , how exponentially growing technology is changing health care .
this is an example of this <unk> .
it &apos;s already wireless <unk> .
and i think a lot of these technologies are going to help us be connected to our patients and take more time to focus on the very important human elements of medicine that are augmented through this kind of technology .
the current trend in medicine is to become exponentially .
when we were doing genomics , when 10 years ago , the first human error was done , the cost of about a billion dollars .
thanks to websites like <unk> like <unk> , or the state of their data on <unk> <unk> or google health , it &apos;s going to always be more important to use all of these opportunities to a more nuanced manner .
we used the cells out of bone marrow to treat a patient with heart disease , we realized a population growth and higher <unk> , the use of their own <unk> cells after a heart attack .
my poem is called &quot; hey . &quot;
your cats , god knows how many people who are pee on their <unk> , their <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
as you cross the <unk> tiles at stage the road , <unk> , <unk> , not looking at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid , a broken part of mine would be out of control , and i &apos;d be stuck stuck in the <unk> <unk> of your <unk> .
but i &apos;m afraid that <unk> comes from and his <unk> .
when we love , they hold me all around you , i &apos;m there , not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that focus attention on critical issues , images are the ones that are <unk> , images that are <unk> to us , and something to do with other words .
in &apos; 80s , the stigma has been an enormous obstacle to discuss this disease , or just mention them .
jonathan klein : photographs that changed the world
i had read a lot of books and <unk> and <unk> .
i was able to see the flag on the stick , which is -- ah , a <unk> moment , and the music was running to a <unk> .
finally , at the morning of the day , we got the <unk> . we got the helicopter -- two helicopter in the <unk> -- two helicopter in the <unk> -- which i got on at the edge of the <unk> .
i knew there were more open bodies , and i had a <unk> .
i had known that , but i had something expected .
this was the view from my tent , when i got this <unk> call .
and only from the air i looked at that .
and they went to the coast and they wanted to go to the coast , and all five died on the <unk> .
and that said a jewish man , so this is called a lot .
but a few days later , we thought , with our students , and we said , &quot; what if that <unk> guy didn &apos;t have been in that state ?
this one day in <unk> miles from the coast of south africa , in one of the most remote regions of the pacific , saw 20 american <unk> their ship in the ocean .
but at a certain point , most of the time , most of them are going to give rise to their visions and become adults .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears more than others .
in fact , fear is an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of <unk> in life , a possibility to a glimpse of the future , if time is time to look at your appearance .
nothing happened . no force . nothing .
we brought them in every living room in the arab world -- international , global , through our english channel .
they were separated from their people , from the crowds , and now we &apos;re going to see them , one after the other .
thank you very much .
because we discovered that it &apos;s going to take people , and people want to be informed , and they have the <unk> through our internet .
and frankie said , &quot; i &apos;m as an active on the row , and i look at the needle to me , and there &apos;s blood .
you want to share a needle just as little as you want a toothbrush , even with somebody who you &apos;re aiming with .
so this is a overview of hundreds of studies of all the high animals in the united states , and these are the studies that show that <unk> are effective , quite many of them .
so you can see these grim pictures from africa .
i mean , well , great <unk> , great .
there &apos;s a little <unk> on the streets . it &apos;s a girl with tail .
she was 105 years old when i took this photograph of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and a little banjo play . here &apos;s a little <unk> .
we were with the car at <unk> , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mom was just like the car .
let &apos;s do it with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white robe in the sky , i know .
so from the <unk> <unk> , which is later the &quot; <unk> &quot; , an instrument with <unk> body and <unk> , where the sound emerges .
well , that &apos;s easier to be said than done .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we put it in about five meters a piece of plywood .
when the sailors were new , the thought came to me , why can &apos;t you combine the oldest <unk> , the &quot; <unk> &quot; rhythms , and what you combine with the latest last technique ?
now , i think it works because scientists are connected as a community .
it &apos;s important to put in the space in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute notion of space , which is god god .
and in an archaeological universe was the only possible explanation that it was built somehow .
and you understand a few things that are better than others , and so there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and giving them politics .
there &apos;s a other tedster that &apos;s been talking about two years ago here two years ago , which is the work of his work in three different levels .
and just leave it out there .
during five months , he &apos;s got to experiment with a complete <unk> <unk> .
it was not very successful . and so on and so forth .
or philip glass or lou reed , or the chemical brothers , who all played there , they all had their own casa text .
after two weeks , three weeks , four weeks .
a little bit of <unk> .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s just about the identity of the living , like the memory of the living to the dead of the living .
but the <unk> and the <unk> image of wealth is also showing the status of the deceased , and it &apos;s the <unk> family of the deceased .
if we could expand our definition of death , to embrace life , we could experience death as part of our lives and perhaps death with something else than anxiety .
i wanted to end my show with a dance end .
you &apos;re talking about living in the water in the water , and the correlation , the correlation between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all naked , less <unk> , and we can do good .
okay , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she &apos;s got a <unk> . &quot;
eight years of history , eight minutes of my show , are just that way .
and jack nicholson says , &quot; well , i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; do this world to a better place when you can .
so i give you the message in advance : trying not <unk> .

and you might think that &apos;s a clue .
so we &apos;re <unk> , and we &apos;ve got some collected , and we &apos;ve found plentiful little animals .

to be precise , today , in your capital , you want some , in those long periods of time , the treasury , and at risk programs like the global fund .
on the contrary , it could save a lot of lives .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program now , you have to think that chris anderson is a <unk> object , like jim <unk> , craig venter , and all of us .

this is normal dna , which is what &apos;s going on for normal dna .
we heat them up , add a little salt , they &apos;re almost to the <unk> and cool it , and during the <unk> , the short strands , the long lines , the long lines , and it turns out a structure .
so that works really well , and you can build patterns and shapes , ok ?
you zoom in , there are only four strands , and you &apos;re sitting on them every single pole that can be able to put on other tiles when they fit .
we have a very ambitious computer program where little changes -- tiny , single mutations -- something that created a square of a size and make something much larger .
and the use of computation are <unk> , and to understand that and get it better in the grasp , as feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .

<unk> <unk> of the fifth , which is the image we see here , died .
so , i want to give you a kind of <unk> approach , which is what that change means : i want to explain to you what the implications of this change for us and our biodiversity has also changed , but also how much of these changes have changed our culture .
and if it &apos;s only about it , that would be really interesting .
and that salmon comes out , it &apos;s going to be a genetically modified infection , which is from the intersection of a gene of this <unk> and another <unk> . so it grows much faster with much less food .
these are actually intersections in reality and not real animals .
we took this animal to this animal . &quot;
in other words , this was the first creatures in the history of this world that had a computer as a parent -- it didn &apos;t have organic parents .

and only in the last 5,000 years , at age temperature and distance .
evolution helps us .
let &apos;s put it on .
so old , and he also his brain damage , so he &apos;s very complicated and very simple -- and that &apos;s at the same time .

we build a system which is all <unk> , the integrity , trust , efficiency and transparency and transparency , and the small farmers are helping to overcome the risk that i described .
we believe that initiative requires great political will , and we need to conform the financial sector , so we have to conform the financial services , and even the underlying legal protections .
my response to that is a <unk> wall from bacteria <unk> sand that stretches through the desert .
it threatens threatens of millions of people , especially in africa and china .
one problem with the plants of trees is that the people in that region are so poor that they use trees to use them as a resource .
and then , after the average cost of 60 dollars for the bacteria that you would never have to pay again , a cubic meter is about 11 dollars .
in a period of africa , population growth could be more than a <unk> .
the world shows me opportunities , and i chose .

and we &apos;ve done that in the last hundred or 150 years .
i &apos;ve got a million times about this , but it &apos;s incredible .
the other forms of climate change is the <unk> of corals . it &apos;s a beautiful picture , isn &apos;t it ?
that doesn &apos;t sell .
and yet , we are , according to our public , alone .
what i saw ? stars , satellites , <unk> airplanes -- typical <unk> .
and what would they be out of these <unk> when it was ?
at first i was embarrassed because i didn &apos;t read the novel &quot; dune &quot; at the time .
and it was so successful that it was even <unk> .
<unk> is a living little city and to get to the beach , she said , &quot; you need a bus and then take a boat . &quot;
one of them was called joseph , and he asked me to what i did , and i explained .
and that &apos;s how we put it in the event .
companies are asking goods for households -- that are us -- and we have value to income , and that &apos;s better so that we can spend these resource to more goods and services .
the <unk> , <unk> , was under zero in 2008 , just before the crisis .
you can hear the idea of five-year-old .
and at the same time , it &apos;s going to be clear because these are not important to change human nature .
in fact , we have to invest in the perception of a meaningful prosperity , which helps the possibilities that people are developing .
first , it &apos;s never supposed to be a economists , so it might be that you have to have something <unk> on your sound .
i painted it straight to the man .
it was about space and light .
this photo was taken when i went to <unk> bay in alaska , and to watch the <unk> management service in the test of their pushcart , <unk> into ice .
the other aspect is that it &apos;s spreading when it hits water .
and that &apos;s actually <unk> .
and then , of course john d. was rockefeller .
it was also the reason for the national institutes act , the clean air , the clean water .
they have <unk> in <unk> , in economy . they &apos;re entrepreneurs . they don &apos;t want to do what they do .
when you look at people who have the <unk> dollars in a year , who have two children or more , and then they have to commute , and then they have to commute .
we have to do the whole thing like <unk> , and you can find more about these politics .
the first person you certainly know .
this is what she tells her in a <unk> &apos; afghan star , how their friends , they don &apos;t <unk> , and they said they were going to leave their friends around the democracy of democracy .
last year , when i was here , i was on the north pole .
it feels like somebody &apos;s going to sit behind you and you put it on your hammer all the time .
and there we sat down , and we <unk> what went wrong there in mt . everest .
<unk> about it , talking about a hundred percent , because there are only very , very few things that cannot be achieved when we use our whole force for doing that .
this is a <unk> . it &apos;s a very simple <unk> computer .
can we reach a kind of <unk> ?
now , what i &apos;m going to show you here is we can make a 3d scan -- the b -- <unk> from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
that &apos;s three minutes .
and if you saw amy smith , she talks about how you get students at mit , with communities in haiti .
and it may be that all the sensations of today &apos;s reality is overwhelming and connected to that , even the multiplicity of problems we have to solve .
we are increasingly aware that we don &apos;t have to go through the entire <unk> .
okay . i &apos;ve also got one .
can we connect back with the natural ecosystems around us , for example , rivers , again , and that <unk> ?
and as you can see , the death of 65,000 deaths per conflict , in the 1950s to 2,000 dead dead per conflict per year in these decade , so terrible that is .
because we did something right , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want the <unk> .
if you don &apos;t know , one of the two will be updated , right ?
the developing world is using soap and water , <unk> .
and now i have the <unk> on this axis .
and you remember the beginning of the last century , that was very bad . until this is a big leap forward .
do you see how it grows ? and how hundreds of millions and billions of people of poverty in asia ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they <unk> malaria .
and we have to look at the way we think of the world with facts .
if you don &apos;t get all the africa out of it . don &apos;t you get rid of it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to be about a superpower around .
and many of you have heard the term &quot; memes . &quot; the evolution of technology is something that i have a lot of attention , so you know , one of the first things you had was a little <unk> .
now , my argument is basically that , well , we &apos;ve always been part of our lives .
and that &apos;s pretty new , and i think it &apos;s going to be much worse -- that possibility -- because of developments in the information technology , in <unk> that can be used as a weapons , like biotechnology or nanotechnology .
i &apos;m doing my best , okay .
&quot; <unk> is our <unk> &quot; means &quot; he &apos;s saved the people &apos;s people , &quot; what at that time was a pretty sophisticated <unk> .
we only have in six countries that means that the media report only about six countries .
so , how should we put our money together ?
none of these countries , including africa &apos;s nation &apos;s nation , has ever been charted its quota .
during this development , we were born , the africans , at the edge of development , and <unk> and implementing politics in our countries .
the administration , most of the time , is <unk> billion .
we &apos;d like you to interview them . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now 14 of the diseases remains treatable , two of them even <unk> .
so for the last 10 years , and as hope for the future , we have seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology : a science of what makes life worthwhile .
and i think there are three different types -- and i call them different , because they &apos;re based on different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have one instead of the other -- three different happy life .
but it turns out that there was no licensed trauma .
you can &apos;t look like <unk> <unk> .
and what you find is that if you do something fun that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
when i was 30 years ago , i thought , when i was good enough to make somebody not depressed , not angry , not angry , i would make him happy .
a polar bear floating in the arctic , photographed by paul <unk> .
but this is what we call &quot; <unk> &quot; when all the parts and not only the event , but it &apos;s also my emotional connection .
nick -- again with a automatic camera -- had thousands of photos of this .
sometimes you can tell a story of historical history in concentrated ways .
we want to find solutions .
and then they kind of running all the time and jumping .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important is because this is an outrageous process that you can look in only three seconds : we can actually <unk> emily in a period of less than one afternoon in several different configurations and <unk> .
emily : image metrics is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
eventually i got involved in it .
in the reservation , there &apos;s a couple of beautiful primates .
but i was in the west , and i was working in the east .
all the time were constantly <unk> , animals killed , the forest collapsed , and so on .

<unk> <unk> : a hero of congo
we &apos;ve got ourselves , almost without realizing it , from a market to a <unk> .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i should warn you what happened with these experiments .
democracy needs no perfect equality , but it needs citizens that share a lifetime of life .
u.s. united states as an arab nation in 1900 , where the line is heading to red .
we &apos;ve got this gift into the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women are at the <unk> .
electricity was also useful for women &apos;s liberation .
one amazing fact for <unk> is that in the first half of the 20th century , the rate of life expectancy is three times as fast as in the second half of the 19th century .
this was the essay i was referring to about 11 years , and for which i got a + + .
i &apos;ve got some that thought , between five and 15 should be my <unk> , and that led to a sense of failure .
so when i look at creativity , i think , i think , is that sense or the <unk> of the relations that i see between basically everything in life .
this is what criminals fischer say because they &apos;re not allowed to kill any creatures .
and they &apos;re going to remember it .
and i had to find what &apos;s going on to the story .
how are we going to anticipate what the accountability and the causes are , outside of a court ?
and you have to be in all possibilities , including those that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you &apos;ll see me , if i look at these examples , because i &apos;m actually talking about everything you might spend your time .
now there are papers about water .
people are paying the full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they have nothing in common .
the <unk> <unk> , which is the central market , that &apos;s the big market .
these guys represent the <unk> <unk> of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be completely <unk> .
so what you need to do is figure out who &apos;s interested in .
nine months later , i <unk> messages at tahrir square , and it was a picture that i saw in my inbox .
thank you .
it &apos;s like the cultural legacy of the cultural legacy in us , circle and the past .
my first documentary for national geographic where i realized that you could make environmental issues in a story about the history of nature , i had <unk> .
that &apos;s the lions and tiger seas .
and because i love sharks -- i kind of obsessed with them -- i wanted to do a different , more positive story of sharks , to talk about protection for sharks .

but when the fish came back , and the population comes back , and the population of seattle , grew up of seaweed in the shallow water .
she &apos;s now living in the jungles of <unk> <unk> , and this is <unk> , and her second son , by the way , the son of the second orangutans .
it was a biological desert .
you can look at the returns and start measuring what &apos;s coming out .
so how do we make this cycle ?
and you need bacteria to bind the nitrogen , and without those microorganisms , there will be no performance .
the humidity is 10 percent higher .
so we can really change the climate .
in <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the terms to protect your own system .
the <unk> vortex , which is a <unk> on a two-wheeler .
i &apos;ll show you another one .

every city has its own design .
twenty-three years later , we asked us to come and see this idea .
this is the italian portal , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the japanese place , the german park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
either it doesn &apos;t exist , or it &apos;s something different , a computer program or something , but it &apos;s not part of the science .
the people always say consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t get to the existence of your own consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to create consciousness , we only need to find the right program .
we &apos;re constantly bringing objectivity and subjectivity as a quality of reality and as one of the world &apos;s record .
do you don &apos;t find ?
but i also meet people who do what they do , and they can &apos;t imagine doing something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
fungi don &apos;t wear <unk> .
perhaps later , not careful .
no , no , she doesn &apos;t .
i just couldn &apos;t make this thing work , no matter how many times or how much i did .
but we &apos;ve got to move from a industrial model to a <unk> where every single school can flourish .
erez , and i wanted to find more about it .
the reason for that is that the historic report is going to be <unk> .
and she got a light . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s serious you .
they took a group of students at a protest in the streets of <unk> .
i stood up , made a tea , sat down , and all i &apos;m here is -- still paralyzed , but here .
so , direct your hand was going to give you the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; from the dictatorship to democracy &quot; with <unk> geography .
it &apos;s not like a <unk> thing .
in fact , chris worried was worried and said , &quot; look at you this picture , you &apos;ll think you &apos;re going to be one of those crazy modern artists that don &apos;t do much . &quot;
it &apos;s a object for the mind .
and the solution that i &apos;m referring to do is look at the biggest culprits in this massive <unk> of earth , through humanity and the <unk> destruction of the biosphere .
so i said , &quot; what would t handle on the edge -- let &apos;s call him <unk> , where you increase the implications in the denominator -- let &apos;s call him <unk> , bring it to where you put the implications ? &quot;
and he was a huge <unk> on the market , which has increased our sales and profits .
we &apos;ve won literally <unk> .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i received an email from glenn thomas , one of my people in california .
so , frankly , afraid of us who are working in business , that the industry has threatened by technology and potentially <unk> .
and truly , we need somebody to be able to communicate for us , so that we have a experience with divinity ?
the arts , whatever you do , are going to take us every time you get to look at it , to look at our relationship with <unk> and curiosity .
the three sisters <unk> <unk> with their passionate music , which is starting to start with the <unk> and <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; by david <unk> . and then they play a <unk> , <unk> version of <unk> <unk> .
the manchester craftsmen <unk> is named after my quarter .
it makes a bunch of money through that from particular furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve taken the public health initiative of the american midwest , which is the harvard &apos;s harvard &apos;s harvard &apos;s harvard , and we <unk> a <unk> for welfare mothers in <unk> in the middle of the city of philadelphia .
we realized that you have to give flowers and eat sunlight and food and expectations and expectations &apos;s music and so you can always heal the spiritual cancer .
these kids who were hungry from the entire world , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re capable of doing , with affection and sunlight and food and food and food and good music and confidence .
and it &apos;s worked pretty well .
and i &apos;m going to allow you to go out concert , and i &apos;ll give you the music . and should you decide to sell them to sell them a agreement that says that the money is used to the support of school . &quot;
this is a space which is designed for nancy wilson , which was taken her policing record in our school .
the brown building , you know , is what you &apos;ve looked at , and i &apos;ll tell you where i made my biggest mistake .
he came to me afterwards . he said , &quot; man , that &apos;s a fabulous story .
and so he &apos;s got a group of people <unk> .
bill <unk> shares a calm and amazing tale of redemption through art , music and unusual alliances .
and then the sound is then <unk> the <unk> code to the brain , and the result is a <unk> that produces a normal <unk> .
but there was the <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how you could make cells better answers to make normal responses , and that was our contribution .
and what she grabs us with a invisible <unk> , the boats out of the environment , so we &apos;re healthy .
but when the bacteria grows and doubling all of them to make these molecules , then the number of molecules are proportionate to the <unk> of the cell to the <unk> .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
that &apos;s just a photo -- a <unk> of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly <unk> , which is that we kill bacteria to antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior , and they want to satisfy tasks that they never might be able to make , if they were only going to act as individuals .
it &apos;s a great honor for me to get to that conference .
or the first ones to come to the hall .
but if we think about justice , aristotle says what we need to think about is the actual character of neural activity and qualities that are worth that you <unk> them , and it recognizes it .
what a reason would you have ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here &apos;s how he <unk> it .
so aristotle &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and the violently <unk> question of same-sex law is right .
michael sandel : the lost art of democratic argument
many people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> have not to tell us about rural guys what we should do with our time .
and i think that &apos;s good -- the future humanity can make such a decision .
so , if that &apos;s what &apos;s called us ?
i &apos;m claiming that the speed &apos;s speed is going to be enough .
i &apos;m claiming that &apos;s nonsense .
we know that there &apos;s this threshold , because we don &apos;t get tired of lawyers before we get to an old age , and even though the damage has been born in front of our birth .
that means you have to make your homework work to understand if that &apos;s true .
audience : hi . i &apos;ve read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of virtually each on the planet for 10 years .
it &apos;s not one of their media .
we don &apos;t care how we make our profit .
they were <unk> into the center of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
but i can &apos;t have a <unk> urban show , which is <unk> than the arguments that i &apos;ve learned from economists , epidemiologists and <unk> .
the <unk> is something scary , and you probably know a part of the <unk> .
in american americans die of asthma , a day of asthma , in the 90s , and almost everything comes out of <unk> .
he had a sense of humor .
politicians and <unk> are afraid of doing more than &quot; <unk> . &quot;
second , because we &apos;ve been exterminated them .
so we thought , &quot; we &apos;re going to do it . &quot;
there &apos;s some amazing animals .
and then the government said , &quot; well enough -- we &apos;ll get rid of it . &quot; and the <unk> people are going to take every stall that they saw .
he might be able to think he would have been born the baby &apos;s baby , so he might need a little bit of help from outside .
and i asked peter , if something changed , and he said , &quot; no . &quot;
we want to talk about &quot; africa : the next chapter &quot; and that &apos;s it : a healthy , <unk> , beautiful africans .
but most of all , you need to be productive in your life , and create a kind of productive environment in our countries so that things can be done .
we can connect this all ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to crawl between the legs of these guys , with my sister on my back to find a window .
you know , we need to use all the good ones .
and i don &apos;t see african employees among them .
the question is , how do we use use of all this good will that comes to us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is an <unk> product , i took this case so that we can study them , just as we can study any other complex machinery .
the method has been applied since the 90s , to study very complex processes .
i want to try to give you a quick story for you .
and then i am in the control , here , playing games .
how do you study rap scientifically now ?
there &apos;s a massive brain activity that &apos;s involved in <unk> .
i want to say , probabilities and statistics , that &apos;s the math of games and <unk> .
that &apos;s very clear and it &apos;s not pleasant .
but take the idea of the eight seconds of eight seconds .
in games and virtual worlds , for example , your facial expressions can and intuitively be used to control a avatar or virtual character .
it &apos;s very quickly , and without an animal electricity , that &apos;s not possible , so kids die .
another point of esther was that we react when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s produced by the amur falcon , and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we have every street , every village , almost every square centimeter of madagascar .
in her <unk> , it &apos;s a very cheap blue laser .
audience : aye .
and what &apos;s interesting is , even though we &apos;ve questioned them all the time , we never did it yet , the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant house house .
this is where you can see here , actually , in a <unk> , which is suspended by the outside and <unk> .
so water is an important aspect .
&quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth &quot; is still .
the idea is not perfected .
they don &apos;t enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it touched the water , you should hear how air works .
once we sequenced these two genomes , we asked ourselves : if this could be the smallest genome of a self-replicating species , it could even give us a smaller genome ?
in fact , we realized that once it worked , a real chance of going on , if we could get the synthetic chromosome , put it to the bacteria .
compassion is <unk> <unk> .
the last one is a quote from robert feynman : &quot; what i can &apos;t compose myself , i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but in fact , in the northwest , we &apos;re very close to the actual notion of the paradise of paradise , which 36 times as &quot; gardens , <unk> through <unk> <unk> . &quot;
but the more you add , the more seems to go , the more seems to go .
and that number of 72 is never going to be before .
this is a nest of a wheels colony , and that &apos;s the nest entrance .
this is a colony which has been founded by a queen in the neighborhood .
the <unk> -- that &apos;s going to be a magnifying show -- are an interesting group . they go early in early morning , before the first group is going to be foraging .
and curiously , interestingly , it looks like about half of the colony , it &apos;s just not doing anything .
the nest maintenance workers just take all the <unk> and put them on the <unk> edge of the wheelhouse and put them there .
but the foragers , however , is not going to get tired of .
and we conducted experiments that show that the longer a ant is going out there , the more it &apos;s going to change the simple <unk> on its surface , and so the ants are changing by changing the ants that they &apos;re making different work .
they cover the entire world , beyond antarctica .
what you see here is that the cost of all for the world is about 89 million barrels of oil , and the annual cost is three trillion dollars .
and we do that for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with it .
i thought about where we could use the natural gas .
and when i went to the <unk> , gas &apos;s nine dollars .
why doesn &apos;t you worry about that ?
it just became 500 million prescriptions .
and that was never even known as the wind or something like that .
tbp : i lost 150 million in wind , ok ?
some have 5,000 . many have more .
there were <unk> . and there were <unk> .
life is a event . contributions it &apos;s the world .
these are work in <unk> manhattan , where you built the first pc building .
and that was , in maybe six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to make the light socket .
a friend of mine told me this story : they weren &apos;t just waiting and they had to wait , but they had to call the <unk> when they were there , the third time , they had to call someone .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m going to use a rather clinical language , and that &apos;s not going to be able to give you as warm as the heart of compassion on compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that <unk> is too good for people who are going to be <unk> .
what &apos;s really about if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you &apos;re not my friend or my family , i &apos;m much less afraid to apply the golden rule .
so , that &apos;s how you look at the results . that &apos;s a zero-sum game .
each shape of the interdependence dependence , <unk> , force one , people &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity .
and then they explain to them , the others think they don &apos;t respected and they want to dominate it , and they hate america .
most of the diseases of poverty , but in the case of cancer in children , the children who died in cancer , mostly from affluent families .
they died a child , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t have that kind of energy and time , if you don &apos;t really care about it .
that &apos;s why he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the dominant <unk> would say that there &apos;s a single oncogene in a single cell , and that they make you a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found some kind of <unk> material that used the right extracellular matrix , we put the cells in and lo and behold , and there &apos;s about four days later , and on the right is what we have created in a culture .
and of course , we &apos;re asking ourselves now where we now go ?
and so i want to end with a poem .
we have a <unk> journalist that was caught in the <unk> ; a boy <unk> , whose book contains so many flashy quotes that you took it out of the shelves , a <unk> over fake <unk> in the new york times .
it sounds a little bit like a curious book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of lying .
he wrote very , very positive reviews about himself . surprise !
you had four good friends of a person &apos;s personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at lying ; sooner , they were spoken and they were on .
they said , how big the bathroom was the bathroom , or said , the <unk> are so <unk> and so far from the hotel .
woman # right there . okay , glass , take a photo .
and you want to have your eyes <unk> .
but it really opened my eyes , how often i &apos;ve got life for email , social networks and so on , even though it &apos;s not really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the wolf with this beautiful band of <unk> .
and each one , which then <unk> , i went to see .
for me , because if i only do the same thing , i &apos;m very , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i look at myself as -- i don &apos;t know what i see myself .
are you nervous , <unk> ?
im : you &apos;re worried ? you look so cute .
anyway , i &apos;m not suggesting that it &apos;s good , but only it &apos;s not <unk> , ok ?
when you have the <unk> too long , it becomes buttermilk .
i call it the era of citizenship -- which is how people are <unk> or <unk> , but as citizens can all be equal same .
in egypt , i &apos;ve been discovered .
this one had been involved in london , in yemen , in the <unk> , a plane to attack america .
there are no ideas and narratives and leaders and symbols that apply to democratic culture on the ground .
as anecdote , we can show that if poverty would be the only factor , well , it &apos;s one of the richest families is one of the richest families .
what happened there was a political coalition which was a political goal , and that was the leader of the leaders .
these tools are going to be more social interesting when they get bored .
he <unk> the limitations of individual networks and <unk> it .
and because of the social networking , chinese students in abroad , or companies from the rest of the world are the offices in china , there were people all over the world that were hearing these messages .
and then finally , the chinese issued the chinese .
we &apos;re increasingly in media companies in social media , social , ubiquitous and cheaply .
but all i &apos;m going to do is double-click , i &apos;ll still look like i did it .
at the fourth <unk> of everest , i was writing a comet over the hump . <unk> .
this view is the <unk> <unk> . the first 2,000 meters of sand from base base .
and that &apos;s in camp 4 .
and there were climbers on this summit ridge .
we also got the bad news that beck weathers , another climber in this storm in snow , collapsed and died .
it &apos;s so strong to work on the top , sometimes i sometimes have syringes straight through clothes .
this climber was <unk> .
and i can only figure out how to do that .
and so it &apos;s going to turn back into action .
these are sherpas , the <unk> light bulb .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s really important to me is , &quot; ideas that we need to engage in . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , by the <unk> , entrepreneur became accountable , and they &apos;re responding to society with society .
it was <unk> people who wanted to make democracy , because they were making the ideas of <unk> , from the universal <unk> , parliament and the constitution and so on .
the third thing is the cities .
the second one is the <unk> we have , which we have , which is really hard to create standardized jobs in companies that 93 percent of the indian jobs are in the <unk> area .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you have the chance to do a modern <unk> , so you &apos;re not going to be the <unk> when you get older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so , you know , the government to do it again .
even though a few people on the left , it &apos;s actually not like the revolution of the market , which is the <unk> , &quot; the government didn &apos;t know . &quot;
they don &apos;t fear the crowds .
so this whole constructive mistrust between the <unk> and the ones that you have .
<unk> .
each of these <unk> would statistically statistically statistically , for two years after the <unk> .
now , cameron cameron , 20 million pounds into a &quot; social <unk> order &quot; to help address this idea . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
<unk> <unk> : investing investment in social change
i &apos;ve been working . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get to the <unk> ?
even when i was with my friend named jack there , i said , &quot; i &apos;m crying , jack . <unk> , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it yet , my name is tom thum , and i &apos;m a <unk> . that means that i &apos;ve just heard anything you just heard of , just by my voice , just with my voice .
and lastly , with this one to my right here , i can <unk> my sounds , <unk> , repeat .
we had to try to see about 5,000 different sets of research to find the right thing .
don &apos;t listen to the people who say that you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .
on the right hand side , it &apos;s a <unk> .
and i &apos;ll give you a couple examples .
you see the blue <unk> .
his wife said it &apos;s &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
a lot of these patients are going to be <unk> .
the results are better than the surgical .
it can stop at anytime and immediately stop .
<unk> street , i know .
and that &apos;s where you really have a lot of your creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that &apos;s going into both directions .
and so , you want to go to the nearest trend , and as quickly as possible .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , is really only within these aesthetic .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time in court , and the retailers have decided that that &apos;s too expensive .
these are the two sets of atoms in a pretty binary hacker within the logic of the <unk> .
and i &apos;d like to thank you to the point of view of this , which is that she &apos;s created this very <unk> presentation of this very <unk> presentation . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
once it took me a boat to a remote <unk> , and i realized that the sound i needed to make is not <unk> .
i think this is one of the most interesting and gnarly things on the planet .
there &apos;s a lot of old research on <unk> across the u.k. , and when you get a lot of noise , you &apos;ll notice that the <unk> is in front of the churches .
this is the <unk> <unk> , which is about 30 years old .
i hope that i find these organisms , can be able to be able to pay attention to their remarkable views of attention , and the part of their <unk> longevity can be done in the near future .
let &apos;s put it on something else .
so , 20 years later , they &apos;re used to be mobile phones , but they also make their own <unk> , like this , which is used by the <unk> corn in all the 31 communities .
what did you do with it ?
what could terrorists do today , using technology now ?
in the united states , the fbi was arrested in the united states , which were <unk> drones to transport in <unk> in <unk> in the united states .
as we &apos;re seeing here , we &apos;re going to turn ourselves into cyborgs .
now , the mortality rate is 70 percent when you get it , but that &apos;s hard .
it &apos;s going to be so many people realizing that the only <unk> funeral is not able to <unk> <unk> <unk> like this one outside of <unk> juarez .
but then , i hear the people how they talk about fear , some of the views of the risk .
and it was <unk> in 1999 when she was working in colombia with the protestant <unk> , with the goal to preserve their culture and language with two other colleagues from the <unk> of the farc trafficked and tortured and killed .
and there &apos;s no group waiting for this kind of manipulation than young men .
patient capital is uncomfortable for the people who are looking for simple solutions , light categories , because we don &apos;t look at profits as the <unk> instrument .
but the entire community , all of the different <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , would be embarrassed and pray . &quot;
because to the <unk> , when she &apos;s full of the juice , she &apos;s beautiful , she &apos;s green , it burns the world , it &apos;s going to go to the sky . &quot;
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i &apos;ve tried to make my wife a little joy .
why are i not aware of their own wife , making efficient forms ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is making cotton and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in my wife &apos;s hands , &quot; why are you going to do such a nail cloth ? &quot;
now , 16 countries can access to it . okay ?
and it was so nice that i was there in the last seven years .
i was working with a huge amount of training . i swam in <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s actually happening that the cells in my fingers and <unk> it .
and my good friend david saw how i thought , and he came up to me and said , &quot; lewis , i know you &apos;ve been 18 years old .
now , the prospect that you could die in 30 , 40 years ago .
england , america , japan , south africa , congo .
it &apos;s about 380 trillion liters of planetary history on earth today , which are still skeptical and nurtured .
now , that might be the end of the story -- okay , we just replace that with conventional , renewables , but i think that the story is even more .
that &apos;s very special material that <unk> itself creates millions of abalone shells , all the time , every day , every year .
and the idea was basically that i was the paintbrush in the hand of the great personality of the great personality that come and i would interview .
but i wanted to go into interviews .
in fact , my first <unk> george abbott <unk> , who was 97 years old , and abbott was full of life -- i think that &apos;s how you can define it .
we know the big breakthroughs , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to communicate , and the meaning of the thing is , is to make nobody ridiculously ridiculously .
when we were alone , i was her audience .
it was not this <unk> , but it was a <unk> for my client .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand that . &quot;
half of the body was not the other .
this is a <unk> in kathmandu , nepal .
i don &apos;t want nice things to do .
there &apos;s a particular kind of treatment , it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not the painting we painted , but what we actually created .
another example : again , a stupid mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million , 20 million dollars on the swiss <unk> , on the <unk> in <unk> , from the ministers of the president , the high school of state .
they even thought of it as a result .
most of the big companies are now convinced that they have to use very strict policies on bribery and so on .
if you want to go into a restaurant , if you look at the menu , then you would expect it all on the map ?
and that was the first time i thought the expression on their face actually reflects what she thinks of him .
now , he divides his life .
this pair of australian century was known for his <unk> , but he also <unk> people .
unfortunately , these <unk> are now living with a series of other orphans in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
the first time i took it at a <unk> dinner , which her parents gave us to honor us .
&quot; i congratulate you to your home , james .
my father used to be my father &apos;s most time in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our movies , they are stories that people can identify .
so it &apos;s a young man out there who can actually bring it to what &apos;s going to be able to do to think about negative things , and all of these , or any <unk> behavior .
<unk> <unk> : so much to say , so little time .
i think that &apos;s really the theme of this event .
you have described this as a <unk> film industry in the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . it &apos;s a <unk> .
now , this is the <unk> . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even though they &apos;re totally <unk> .
we &apos;re called &quot; portal , &quot; because you go to walls to create new spaces .
so , time , space , aesthetic , and then most importantly , behavior .
on the way , i had to put a few bridges behind me .
it all boils down to the <unk> and the students who said the first meeting that they were going to give them a place .
so i set up some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and <unk> things that i usually drew .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army knife for me to become a phosphorus sandwich .
and one day i had one -- oh , vice versa .
i &apos;ve got the <unk> and the copper was very thin , so that it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and that &apos;s my cafeteria .
and it reminded me why i was doing things like my house as <unk> .
it was never finished .
the dome was a wish of <unk> .
it was an attempt , this thin piece of land -- it &apos;s about 30 feet -- into a resource -- into a resource by widening these areas and that <unk> and dining room in this room , <unk> , with a high room in it .
they call the &quot; plan &quot; design .
here it is .
in the background , it seems like <unk> iceberg in the mountains .
our education doesn &apos;t want art , so -- and when we met our new acousticians , he told us that this was the right shape .
in barcelona , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re working on it , at the end of the <unk> , which was built by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
can we do not make a clean energy savings ?
and one of the things that she found was she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
and these are our <unk> briquettes .
and it has the problem of the health impacts of <unk> wood and charcoal .
it &apos;s a place where , for instance , if this is india , in this room only three of us have a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts as in the united states to make things .
there &apos;s a big difference .
and after a surgery , everything .
now , that &apos;s not surprising . but we asked them to nurture their fortunes and intelligence , kindness and <unk> .
he got married . he had a son named <unk> .
is that business with our outward and our employment with a <unk> phenomenon ?
i want to tell a little bit of the surgeries that we &apos;re doing , how far we are , and where we want to be .
we can replace it underneath the bone cells , but we &apos;re not very far with replacing bluefin tuna .
my theme is the food in schools because this is about social justice .
and the next one is <unk> .
people are talking about sustainability . but we should figure out what &apos;s at all .
do you know that all of you think they &apos;d have to eat more and more food ?
and then they have <unk> , hey , we can sell the stuff of children .
and this is a typical toy seller .
the things we might do at home , and as important as we do , we need to teach kids in schools .
we need to educate the employees .
this eight billion , by the way , two dollars and 49 cents -- so much money is ready for a lunch .
and as a little girl was sitting on a hot <unk> , with me out in the sun .
when i go to a party , and people ask me what i do , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; , your eyes are matt .
i want to know their <unk> , all about your <unk> creatures , <unk> -- that you are an expert in things in your consciousness .
don &apos;t break the tension . i want to be more energy-efficient .
it &apos;s a documentary in <unk> of consciousness .
when i got closer , i expected to recognize all the details of most people , their clothes and so on .
how do you know it was that what you did ?
do you see it ? who &apos;s not going to help you ? that &apos;s going to help .
we &apos;re starting to start <unk> . some examples .
today , jeff has said his efforts to bring a great theory of great theory into neuroscience .
and the <unk> in london said , &quot; what do you mean with : &quot; who &apos;s responsible for london -- &quot; i mean , nobody is responsible . &quot;
now , congestion scientists have been introduced to the survey at 3 a.m. and the first image ; here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , a typical street at the 50th january .
so we did this enormous survey with many <unk> and trying to figure out who changed and where they disappeared .
then i went to <unk> for 20 years -- from east europe to central asia -- through the mountains of the caucasus , the east east , north africa , north africa , north africa .
what do we know from the <unk> of the taliban that are <unk> to the doors of the people who drive their daughters to schools like in <unk> ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was tidied up , i had the blue <unk> on the walls .
and there were even two of them .
there was really what happened .
how amazing is that ?
i want to talk about a few other patients that are doing everything in your power to improve health care .
and then i realized that this is the side of google earth , where we can fly to each address .
we are , they &apos;re the most dangerous resource in health care .
<unk> von seawater is a <unk> .
here &apos;s the resolution . there &apos;s a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take their environment with the sound of sound . i &apos;m talking about the <unk> .
in the united states in the united states , the annual cost would be on <unk> 22 billion dollars , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to be looking at in any case of prosperity .
why should we be dealing with aging ?
when you go to the night sky and look at the night sky and this beautiful , flying animal , i wish you smile . thank you very much .
europe had to be <unk> into economic development .
the extremes of the resources are not all of these , but there are many countries in the bottom billion , but there are many countries in the bottom billion .
so what &apos;s wrong ? why is it called &quot; <unk> &quot; ?
and so the countries of the bottom billion is a very <unk> politics .
a few economists came up in time and said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try a auction ? she &apos;s going to reveal the value . &quot;
in that moment in the world , there &apos;s a billion people in the world , or <unk> countries , and how can we help them ? the economist paul collier delivers a simple , compassionate plan that we can connect to the gap between poor and animal .
we don &apos;t have any containers in which they &apos;re going to be created .
this is where he gives a great surgeons in africa that &apos;s required to go to the <unk> cortex .
so what we did was , imagine that they thought they thought they thought they were doing a lecture and they could talk to the people in their native language .
&quot; <unk> of <unk> surgery .
fourteen years ago , i came across this regular material , <unk> , which was used for centuries in the same way .
he asked me if i could build this as a <unk> piece for the city .
so we &apos;re experimenting with little <unk> <unk> to create a dry mist , which is shaped by wind , and what you &apos;ve done is it turns out to be shaped by people who can interact with it , without being <unk> , without being <unk> .
they were in their <unk> in the grass , watching some gray patterns of the <unk> next to people they didn &apos;t know , and they got the <unk> of the wonder .
and i also became aware that this is an enormous risk for our society .
when peter moves his arm , this yellow dot is what you &apos;re seeing here in the process of doing that in <unk> mind .
when you do that , what are you going to control ?
and to say , these changes can also be about death , even a claim to be a fact that , of course , true or wrong .
now let me tell you what i don &apos;t say . i &apos;m not suggesting that science can impact this space , or that we &apos;re going to have scientific answers to each <unk> moral question .
now why would this have a objective morality ?
what &apos;s the probability that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left hand , you see edward <unk> .
we live in a world full of <unk> technologies and these technologies can &apos;t be repeated , it &apos;s always easier things to break as they fly together .
but then we have to talk again about comfort in a bigger context .
and what &apos;s his natural enemy , which is the means of the <unk> of good bugs that we talk about ?
she &apos;s a parasite , no <unk> , but a <unk> <unk> , two millimeters long , slim , a fast and <unk> <unk> .
and if you look at these good <unk> , for example , in a <unk> , you go to the flowers .
in israel , for example , where we have about 1,000 acres -- that &apos;s about 10,000 israeli <unk> -- <unk> <unk> at <unk> , 75 percent of the pesticides of pesticides .
third , to increase the consciousness of the farmers for the potential of that incision .
<unk> is one of my favorite writers .
now , it &apos;s not fun to make fun of the <unk> , than over <unk> , and i do it often .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new york needs .
her <unk> name was <unk> <unk> , and that was that -- i was not <unk> enough to say , &quot; take the drawing . &quot;
or the collapse of the soviet union was only a few decades , maybe within a decade , after the time , the soviet union was most powerful .
because there &apos;s 80 percent out there who really eat insects .
they &apos;re at the beginning of <unk> .
why are we going to do that even in the soup , but it &apos;s already meat in meat ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per year .
at now we &apos;re going to decide to do this for one , or to five pounds of output .
we can increase them a little bit more than we can increase , but it &apos;s going to be a marker .
and you might think , well , they &apos;re not available yet .
now , three minutes , i didn &apos;t start , right ?
he said , &quot; allison , we have to put them on the table .
and i saw a sign .
even if the brain processes the system , they do it in a way that comes to society .
and in this book , the little lewis find the big idea .
that &apos;s a <unk> . and on the back there are some other gadgets , <unk> , and scales to do some of the lines . okay ?
right . so , this is what the device is used .
there &apos;s an quality of craftsmanship and precision that &apos;s quite remarkable and remarkable .
so the first robot i want to talk about is called strider .
it &apos;s only used to demonstrate that if you have cameras or other sensors because it &apos;s high , it &apos;s a meter 80 size , you can see over obstacles through <unk> and <unk> .
for instance , in this case , even though the left and the right wheel is connected to a single axis , and that &apos;s pretty quickly spinning .
welcome to <unk> , the robot <unk> lab of <unk> nichols . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the <unk> .
let &apos;s see how he &apos;s doing . this was our first try , and ... <unk> !
but what &apos;s the secret of our success ?
but only one spark of imagination is not enough .
in this way , education is very important .
<unk> that are going to be <unk> .
basically , there &apos;s no pool of good samaritan teachers , and only eight percent of the people of county have about a <unk> or a higher degree .
there &apos;s a complete emptiness of creative capital in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the <unk> on the wheels , it &apos;s won the team .
but in the last couple decades , there was a lot of money that was meant to stick out for regular .
and going out to go out and be able to interview the neighbors about what &apos;s going to buy and how to do it , and why , is a homework .
in these , it &apos;s horizontal to create large residential surfaces .
i want to invite you , my journey of <unk> and exploration .
after four months of rejection , it arose , and now he &apos;s got lost eight months before .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
now , this global act is going to be in the same terms of climate change , even more than that .
when i knew about these two things , it was very , very , both for personal reasons as well as for scientific reasons .
it &apos;s got a very good <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was partially by the ronald mcdonald foundation .
so after treatment , we &apos;re going to make the child a series of simple <unk> to see how his vision was supposed to be like that . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ;
the answer is movement . that &apos;s what i want to show you in the next video .
i had to discuss a long time with my wife .
so , we &apos;re going to track these <unk> , and hopefully , we &apos;re going to have more results to report .
and then i took off from those <unk> for <unk> disabled runners , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i get about it , i &apos;ll look at how that &apos;s like this .
but this was in the fall &apos; 95 , and then as the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so it has been aimee to the <unk> 1996 , and it &apos;s very excited . their family travels -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried everyone that i could , <unk> against who , against what runners , so who am i going to do here ?
i always won everything , and now i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> . just take it off . &quot;
milo : aimee and the designers are going to be at ted <unk> 2 , and we &apos;re going to talk about the design .
they gave someone who came across and the shoes came out .
but it &apos;s almost impossible , the actual losses of the economy , unless we use pennies .
or about the 75,000 jobs .
and even something about mathematics : mathematics looks like math -- like in this example here -- and sometimes they don &apos;t do it -- like &quot; am i drunk ? &quot;
in the classroom , we spend about 80 percent of the time to teach people how to do step three of their hand .
when people ask me , right ?
but the automation in cars allowed these things to separate these things , so that &apos;s what &apos;s going on than building a car and the learning of his <unk> .
totally wrong .
but i think we can do two at the same time .
and one of the reasons why this is so important -- so , it &apos;s very important , the computer in the exams .
it was winter , and i &apos;ve been around for about a year ago .
and i thought specifically my father , who was upset was a surgical man &apos;s brain surgery on the brain .
just as you can , just by the grasp of the <unk> , which is changing , and the time you begin with time , a notion of where you are and what you &apos;re aiming for .
but when i was a <unk> and then the broadway went along , i was blessed with each corner .
if you design a city in the blind world , there will be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of this experience , the article said , &quot; i think you think of it . &quot;
and the <unk> of the apes i knew -- the ten commandments , love your next , is fertile and <unk> you ...
you give money to a good predictor and develop emotional food on the ground .
she &apos;s not a book that was written and rolled off the sky .
and that &apos;s actually the key to me , in fact , to remind myself that there &apos;s not the way the car isn &apos;t <unk> , and i didn &apos;t climb up on the way across the stairs .
that was very inspiring to me .
so if we want to put this book on this book , we really have to do it , and we &apos;re really tasked with it , and with him .
so we have this wonderful progression .
the academics that <unk> that work thought about is too <unk> , so we have developed application application like this <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of a <unk> on a <unk> to a laser .
so , early on a small , sort of nice , independent <unk> called &quot; minority report &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to develop the interface that was going to be used in the film .
we &apos;re going to take these <unk> surgery through because we like yellow and <unk> on the ground of the ocean .
let &apos;s pull that apart : i put it in <unk> .
we , as humans , are the things that work and we should make sure that our machines help us and build on it .
john , thank you very much to make a reality .
what okolloh did not have been able to do without digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are going to be represented by this black line , said , &quot; we &apos;re changing those procedures .
they &apos;re created by the members of the community for each other .
and like all good <unk> , they do a leap of 20 years when the interest changes the audience .
you don &apos;t always have five days . so , and we started to play <unk> .
india didn &apos;t want to teach the <unk> .
the other one was cricket .
is that the new india ? this was a different world where you could get player from all over the place for the best price for the best price .
we &apos;ve all seen games in calcutta , but we &apos;ve never seen anything like this . <unk> khan brought the audience with a <unk> song to the <unk> -- for calcutta , not for india , but for calcutta .
would you imagine that this day would come ?
hopefully , i &apos;ve made each of them to work every one of them , and hopefully the game , and hopefully , there &apos;s a long time to work in this business .
and you know that the <unk> dogs are , because they &apos;ve been watching quickly in mind , how often you saw dogs and pigs on the leash .
why about all in the world should anybody play in the world ?
on the other hand , if you go to a developing country and you can buy a <unk> for 25 dollars , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend your <unk> 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you an example .
and if the road to the other end of the city is 100 bucks , it &apos;s worth 100 bucks , absolutely no matter how they &apos;re saved . but people don &apos;t think like that .
now , in large , you &apos;re enormously impatient .
watch what happens when we <unk> <unk> .
so , i &apos;d like to hear more . so you say our answer to the terrorism , i mean that it &apos;s a kind of mental mistake ?
it &apos;s not going to be <unk> .
and so some people respond to economists as stupid people .
the variation and variation is one of these <unk> that requires a certain intellectual activity , because you always compare the variation with the topic that you have in mind .
and in fact , in words , and in fashion , the same rule is very serious when it &apos;s too old , or too old , is not the first one that &apos;s the last one that supports the old emergence of the old emergence of the old emergence of the old emergence of the old emergence of the old emergence of the old emergence of the old emergence of the old emergence of the old container . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe that &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first , my willingness to give me a critical audience without realizing i &apos;m sure of it .
it &apos;s my purpose to <unk> the poster <unk> , you haven &apos;t got it yet .
so in the large and all of them , they survive our survival .
members have often a <unk> smell of smell .
when the space splits out , we saw that individuals were more negative attitudes of <unk> men .
it &apos;s like i &apos;m talking specifically to talk about what i &apos;ve done in these 20 years in the distance .
it feeds my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re shit .
there &apos;s a young director , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what cinema means .
i got sick . i got sick .
we don &apos;t need any more trouble the idiots !
our government was corrupt .
so , for me , the idea is that we have all these kids , it &apos;s a generation , we have a whole generation of children that had to be so much psychological trauma or damage , and africa has to live with it .
through the whole book , more than an hour <unk> <unk> and interactive animations .
what &apos;s the business of doing business ?
it was at least the realization that you were going to be , always , to be true , to be true .
so i thought , &quot; yes , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
they &apos;re still talking about it .
when i came from college , i was working in southern california , and you were looking at the spanish <unk> on the rooftops and these things .
rsw : how does it look like this ?
the <unk> -- they took me for this mit , and they sent their technical <unk> to bilbao .
this is reminded me .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
when you take four for three months with three <unk> , the ideas are always holding and usable .
and one thing i wanted to mention at my ted wish , but it was kind of <unk> to thank all the companies that helped me .
but in the meantime , these things are going to be momentum .
and this is 10 weeks later , by hand <unk> .
you can see the glass , the <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> and things is remarkable , and that &apos;s going to be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible effort , 15,000 workers , i think , five domes and the sixth is going to be here .
at this stage , around the 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computers in the world would land to the recycling of china .
it was quite unusual , so stefan , that less than five percent of advertising had a picture as a symbol .
and wish three is : <unk> . i was told that i was going to make myself one , and i &apos;d always wanted to do something like that .
and it &apos;s increasingly more important that we figure out how to get rid of these resources out of these very complex disparities .
the traditional ways of dividing materials , doesn &apos;t work for <unk> .
the traditional way to create greenhouse gases is happening with oil or petrochemicals .
and at the end of this process , we have a breakthrough scaling : lots of different types of <unk> and lots of different qualities of plastics .
now i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we &apos;re seeing is that people tend to commit mistakes in the same way , again , again .
maybe how to make the monkeys make choices and find out whether they make the same league as we do .
here &apos;s mayday . it &apos;s going to be a token against food and waits happy , and you get your food .
she waits a little bit of a impatient on the market .
now imagine that i put each of them on each of these 1,000 <unk> dollars in the hand , so 10 <unk> of notes .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- so i &apos;ll throw a coin , and you &apos;re going to lose a coin , you &apos;re going to lose a lot .
if we were able to market the same scenarios , they would do the same things that people would do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not just the people on the last stage of development that make stupid errors .
and that &apos;s the catch .
but if we think about couples , they usually have four stories high .
we have to be less with concrete and steel and we need to build higher . last time we &apos;ve been working on <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s just as much as we have in a year of early cars in the streets .
<unk> curtains <unk> my windows .
perhaps even &quot; citizen , &quot; because recently , it was ready to fight against the decline of the law , and the citizens of these networks together to help each other . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp;
<unk> , the largest and oldest bank in russia , mostly in russia , is now using biological to control employees and citizens in the development of innovation planning to the development of innovation innovations . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
we &apos;ve heard about a ted talk about people who have their plants with arduino , and <unk> work is working on the world young people , to create the websites , to create the websites , to create videos . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt
and so i began to think that the eternal mother always asks himself : &quot; are all the children ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to convey a message , and all of the reading in their own language a central <unk> , which was a version of the golden rule : &quot; what you don &apos;t want you to do , you &apos;re not going to do the other . &quot;
a pastor means to take care of these individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this by a couple of <unk> .
there &apos;s about 180 notes in washington d.c.
it &apos;s already taken by parks and sculpture .
it &apos;s made of <unk> fiber optics .
there &apos;s also a couple constraints of his illumination .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i saw my aunt raping when i was only five .
one of the things i experienced when i was trying to eat my friend , because we didn &apos;t have food , and we were about 400 .
as a child , as young as a child , words that i can &apos;t forget , i don &apos;t forget .
that &apos;s my story , you know , you get a lesson / memory .
my breakfast , my lunch , i &apos;m finishing on a foundation that i founded , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools to give us tools . give the farmers .
audience : aye .
the third chapter is an even more complicated <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent of it .
we &apos;re going to do this job by making the problem of death penalty .
and even when that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
santa knows whether you were <unk> or not . right ?
but julie , you were so prepared for the school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and smiled , in the sense that was the right answer . then they said , &quot; do you think we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your bigger ability to cooperate and adapt ?
i think this film shows the hardest view of modern times : the road .
in world war ii , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we can &apos;t forget that it takes a fundamental contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet are using .
but now to the good news !
you may have latin latin .
and at that point , the skeptics and <unk> of climate change is in vision .
so a few years ago , we had a project for the <unk> . a big program , it was called the <unk> -- with many , many people -- lots of experts involved -- all on evidence -- it &apos;s been involved in evidence .
a group of effort for yourself , and the other group is supposed to spend it for other people .
when they first went from the first building to the second , all of a man walking around and freezing , and clearly needed help . the question is : stop it and helped them ?
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; about &#93; : the hidden life of living things .
since then , four decades ago -- i &apos;ve been training with the best in this field , in the world , and i &apos;ve been teaching young and old bear , created , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> a very <unk> network of art , middle and <unk> .
and i found that in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my real life .
i danced between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it to my <unk> .
well , it was essentially frustration .
that &apos;s what it was like then .
he put them together , put them into a little bit of <unk> , and then he put it into this software that i think they had been developed his son . and he created this wonderful presentation .
in those documents , there &apos;s little <unk> , little boxes .
i &apos;d like to suggest -- yeah , make a beautiful website . how could i tell you , don &apos;t you make a nice website ?
now you ask the linked data that you have now put together now . 32 hits , each of which is a protein with these properties , and you can look at it .
and this is about linked data .
so , this is going to lead to two million children every year , last year , than in 2000 .
and when it &apos;s like that , we &apos;re ready to be able to collect feedback and give feedback , to make sure that the promises are really results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that the number ?
my brothers started to give me to draw and paint .
that &apos;s what i was fascinated with finding this area .
how many of you have seen a cow about the street from bangalore to mysore ?
it &apos;s only that we &apos;re trained as people to perceive reality . and that makes meaning .
and they said , &quot; okay .
don &apos;t you make anything , you &apos;re an artist ? &quot;
this is a box of <unk> .
because when we see somebody &apos;s track , we see the footprint .
which percentage of you have taken the <unk> ?
sure , he took the last 20,000 years in a burrow .
so the <unk> is really complete suited to conclude here , because , if you think about it , i have today about the so-called economists today , that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to do something technical .
think of toyota .
you can &apos;t <unk> , so you accept it and find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to vote .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> are you going to get a hunger if you have hunger .
there are millions of different constructs .
so remember if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re out in baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet <unk> chen and goes , &quot; i can &apos;t bear the <unk> .
and that &apos;s , &quot; how much percent of the day do you think of that person ? &quot;
over the high societies , people have left <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
they came home with <unk> percent of the <unk> .
and it really became a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think men are synesthetic than women ? &quot;
at no time on this goods , the women were so educated , so interesting , so interesting .
she &apos;s plugged it since she was 13 .
i started to <unk> , why you &apos;re going to fall in love with a person , than in the other .
they &apos;re going to insist as long as the human race is based on what shakespeare &quot; these <unk> spiral . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin resistance .
maybe we should be wondering whether it might be that the insulin resistance is the cause of energy and disease disease -- at least most people ?
well , it &apos;s too much more inclusive .
peter <unk> : what if our views are wrong about diabetes ?
my great grandfather henry ford , really believed that it was the mission of ford motor company to improve people &apos;s lives and make cars for everybody .
and the good news is that today we &apos;re doing the great problems of cars and environment -- not just ford , but more importantly than industry .
i think you can imagine it .
but what really excites me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars begin to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute .
i think now my mother , i think , is kind of a <unk> .
the nurse needs to go through data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s a lot . &quot;
so what is it coming out ?
it was great for us , because we won a lot of awards .
i was infected when i was 17 , when i was 17 , when a student , i found adults that were really involved in my ideas , <unk> me and a lot of <unk> <unk> with me .
now it &apos;s all about kids . we don &apos;t <unk> .
in fact , we gave kids a simple task .
for our auction we have a couple of wonderful images for you , for a really good purpose , the money that you &apos;re going to give us to buy .
but what i &apos;d never said about , and what i &apos;d like to make is that <unk> &apos;s cool .
in a way , in a way , in a way , in the <unk> , or <unk> available product here , we have <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , which is another kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of <unk> experience . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
when you think about the changes in our society , the <unk> from the land into the cities , the 200 years has taken the same process in 20 years .
it saw changes even though they were still unknown .
so , for example , we &apos;re going to put the models under an artificial sky .
i think it &apos;s a reduction in 94 percent of the time .
and how do we make a difference in this growing world , especially in some places i talk about -- china for instance , for example , in the next 10 years , 400 new airports .
and this is the focus of the <unk> talk -- there &apos;s no lighting in the positive senses , which is healthy and well-being , without failing darkness .
as opposed to the first office i showed you the beginning of the talk , this is a very popular office , which is that the <unk> .
behind you , you see the <unk> building , which is later becoming a icon of the modern <unk> .
i find that what you &apos;re seeing here is quite amazing -- how much light hits the sky and never reaches the ground .
it &apos;s not very pleasant and <unk> .
they &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
when our <unk> , like a few weeks earlier , a war in a third of india , about 200 <unk> of india , the <unk> , is the subject of anger , he &apos;s about to be heard .
and one day , i didn &apos;t know what happened -- as i was home from the office home , i might see a <unk> , or it came to me in the sense that i could be like a <unk> , that life would be wonderful .
ag : but what &apos;s it used to use ? what &apos;s it used ?
to do what to do ? to break rocks .
that &apos;s the only place where you could express your creativity .
they don &apos;t want a second choice of standards and <unk> .
and that &apos;s what sheikh <unk> has done .
i had to go to my favorite .
mr. <unk> , who lives with a physical challenge , is only 50 inches in size .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
these are <unk> billion people .
or ski . it &apos;s just fun , and people love to do it and make fun things .
so we worked very , very hard , but we knew it wasn &apos;t so hard to develop the technology as the acceptance of what &apos;s important and how technology can be used .
cars are not done for doing next ; it &apos;s wonderful <unk> to drive them between cities and to drive through cities , but think about it : we &apos;ve solved all the problems in terms of scale and speed .
so if we could <unk> this box here , we could have a solution for transportation , electricity , and communication , and perhaps drinking freshwater in an urban package , 60 kilogram left ?
<unk> or explicitly realized that the people who die there were actually involved in drug users . this is what we regain to the fact that they were either tortured or they were even both <unk> or even both .
they &apos;re going to be los zetas as a ties of psychopaths , fear and <unk> in cities and the press bring them to silence , and that &apos;s true for most .
now , and the u.s. and the united states is now to be inspired by the production of production and global partnerships in the south and global partnerships in the global distribution . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but part of it is to be a monthly college student -- you live in the future . and we have a long time lapse .
and after they fall under a critical price , she goes , you know , if she &apos;s successful , about a critical mass , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and look at the interesting implications , if you &apos;re going to be cheaper , the brands , the <unk> and so forth , and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , you win .
if you look here , linux is in red , it &apos;s got 20 percent .
&quot; open open &quot; is really , you know , the gift of the orange <unk> to the world .
because of some of the technologies we talked about .
patient capital operates in between , and it &apos;s trying to take advantage of the two of the two .
the second one had to be very cheap .
president obama understand that .
because one of the poorest farmers in the world has access to a technology that has enabled it to change his life .
and yet , these are the characteristics of the men and women are honored by all generations .
you remember , during the <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in his blog , and <unk> it , it was only able to use because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like <unk> , and i think i heard steve martin play , and i said , i can also do that .
i wrote this post , and i took this for einstein today .
and you see that post .
these little things .
and maybe i have to <unk> , because i &apos;m going to get out of it when i talk about it .
it has been sustainably since recently , except from our generation .
we need to use this procedure instantly to get better understanding of the ocean .
we &apos;ve studied that fish of greenhouse gases , but we had to learn how to hold it .
but it &apos;s only half the size of the biggest tuna that we &apos;ve ever tagged .
they come together . that could be sex under , and there it is .
you can see a lure -- it &apos;s kind of like a seal -- and a white shark is going to go on that , a <unk> creature that comes close to our 16 foot .
and then they give us these animals a encore , by helping us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t think that the records of my childhood was going to be so precise .
they said , &quot; no matter what we &apos;ve been talking about , are you groups who want to harm the u.s. ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to waste your energy .
so who now look at my <unk> , and i know that i was there , and knowing that i was on the ninth for $ 80 <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
so all the few moments i &apos;m going to give you a <unk> on my life .
when i came to the project , people were saying , &quot; why would you tell everyone what you &apos;re going to do and where you are ?
now it &apos;s very normal .
now , look at these <unk> of paris to see how incredibly fast growth is .
i looked for thousands of these <unk> , and trust and efficiency are always crucial elements .
how do we <unk> how trust from face-to-face to face ?
i was kind of a spirit in the system .
this side is going on on a day , and 80 percent of them get a precise answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see him in relation to the degree of inequality , which i showed you that i &apos;m going to come back again .
first of all , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second time , with the 50 american states -- with the same question : do the more unequal states on all these scales are worse ?

and we africans need to start to satisfy our leaders &apos;s leaders .
my cousin couldn &apos;t afford to do this , and she &apos;s very clever .

is the country living between politics and religion .
it &apos;s also our political problems .
<unk> and future leaders were shaped .
he was helping in parol at birth .
it &apos;s the heart of medical care .

and she said , &quot; i saw your talk in live .
i said , &quot; when 500 to 1,000 or 2000 , my life is over . &quot;

now , our own classrooms are significantly faster than we have a healthy profits , and that even though we treat a lot of people .
that &apos;s a hard task .
so , for example , we can make digital content with physical mass .
wouldn &apos;t that be an opportunity to design mobile phones ?
it was like i couldn &apos;t see me as if i was invisible .
and also , nobody had ever before a <unk> or seen a <unk> , and this is what the creation of this is the creation of new ways of improvisation , his and knowledge , because now you have this concept in your head in your head in your head in your head , your mind in your mind , because now you have this concept in your head in your head in your head , your mind in your mind , because now you have this concept in your head in your head .

what does that mean for medicine ?
and so he sequenced the genomes of his children .
it &apos;s because there would be somebody in the audience who would stop eating .
so , imagine in 2016 , the leading <unk> doesn &apos;t just replace their four years of <unk> , but also their personal genome .
and so , you know , i &apos;m going to give you all the time and the <unk> revolution , which is happening around them .
and we have a <unk> , artificially printer with a special <unk> , which is within the solid part of the body space , and moving across the edges of the hip .

and we also heard of the story , from the bloodline of human rights .
in the <unk> , we find many , many examples of compassion , for love and real altruism .

and you know what i mean . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
take the <unk> for all the problems that we have in the planet , on the environment and in social . it &apos;s a message of hope .

in the current <unk> , we have dawn -- two years &#91; <unk> &#93; , half a million to a million , fairly complex , new and exciting technologies of steel , concrete , glass , glass .
