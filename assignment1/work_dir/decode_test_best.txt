you know , one of the great explorers in travel and one of the pleasure in the <unk> research is to live together with the people who remember the old days , and they &apos;re still feeling in the wind , and they &apos;re <unk> on the <unk> bricks of the plants , they <unk> into the bitter petals of the plants .
knowing that <unk> is still beyond the milky way across the milky way , or the meaning of the oldest of the oldest of the oldest of the oldest , or that in the himalayas , the <unk> is still tracking the breath of <unk> , which is the idea that the world in which we live in , in a perfect sense , but only as a model of a group of particular ways that we &apos;re living in , it &apos;s the idea of the world in which we live in .
and of course , we &apos;re all sharing the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
we &apos;re going through <unk> .
we have to deal with the <unk> separation by death and so we should all sing we all sing , dance and art and art . we can bring art together . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; /
but , interestingly , the unique inflection of the <unk> , the rhythm of dance in every culture .
in fact , it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the <unk> in the forests of borneo , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warriors in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the <unk> , or an <unk> in the middle of the sahara , and it happens to be the colleague that i traveled in front of a month in the desert , or even an <unk> on the <unk> of the world .
all of these people teaching us that there are other <unk> , other ways of thinking , other ways to the surface of the earth .
and that &apos;s an idea that , when you think about it , can make one only hope of hope .
together , the world &apos;s largest cultures form the world a web of <unk> and <unk> live , which is the earth , and it &apos;s equally important for the earth as important as the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
now , you can imagine this cultural <unk> as a <unk> , and it can be used as the <unk> of all thoughts and dreams , myths and intuitions that have been generated by the human imagination since the beginning of consciousness , which is defined by the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all what we are and what we &apos;re capable of as amazing species species .
and just as the biosphere got too much eroding , this happened with the <unk> -- only with more serious speed .
not a biologist , for instance , would argue that 50 percent or more of all species are about to die , because it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- the <unk> <unk> in the field of biological diversity -- hardly any of the things that are known as the <unk> <unk> of cultural diversity .
and the crucial documentation for that is the extinction of languages .
when all of you were born in this room , on earth 6,000 languages .
now , a language isn &apos;t just the sum of the <unk> , or a series of <unk> .
a language is expression of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a means by which the soul of a particular culture is access to the physical world .
each language is like a <unk> forest of the mind , a turning point , a thought , an ecosystem .
and by those 6,000 languages today , as we sit here in monterey , the half are no longer going into the ears of children .
they &apos;re not going to teach kids anymore . meaning that if nothing is going to happen , they &apos;re actually already dead .
what could be more than the silence , one of the last of your people who speak to your language , not having an opportunity to have the wisdom of ancestors , or the hope kids ?
and yet , this terrible destiny actually is somebody somewhere on the ground , about every two weeks , because every two weeks is a human , and takes the last <unk> of an old language with the grave .
and i know that some of you will say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot; the world isn &apos;t a better place , if we all talk only a language ? &quot; and i said , &quot; good , let those language be terrible . let &apos;s be <unk> .
let you be <unk> . &quot;
and then you would suddenly realize what it would be like if you could not speak your own language .
that &apos;s why i &apos;d like to take you to a journey through the <unk> , a little journey through the <unk> , to try to give them what &apos;s been lost .
now , there are some among us who feel like i say , &quot; different ways of his name , &quot; really different possibilities of his name .
so for example , for example , this kid &apos;s <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people of <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east in the belly of saint snakes .
that &apos;s a people who disagree with the color of color and green , because the <unk> of the forest , from which people depend , is <unk> .
they have a strange language , and one of them is called the <unk> <unk> : you have to marry somebody who talks to another language .
all of these are in the <unk> past , and the sequence on these big houses , in which due to six or seven languages , is that you &apos;ll never hear somebody who learns language .
they just listen to them , and then they start to speak .
or , one of the most intriguing tribes that i ever lived with , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first year of july peaceful .
in 1957 , they tried to record five <unk> and make a funny mistake .
they found out of the air out of the air , which we were going to be as a friendly gesture , which is how they read that these people from the rainforests in their life never had seen a little <unk> .
they took this photographs from the forest , trying to look behind the face or the character , didn &apos;t have anything and <unk> that this was an <unk> of devil and killing the five <unk> with the spear .
but it didn &apos;t just kill the <unk> with the spear .
they were moving each other .
99.9 percent of deaths have happened by <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> eight generations , and we found two cases of a natural death , and when we were dealing with people a little bit about it , they gave it that one of the people had gotten as old as it was because of his age , and we killed him with the spear .
but at the same time , they had a clear bias of the forest , which was amazing .
their predators could smell the urine of a product in 40 steps , and determine , which survives of that owned .
in the early &apos; 60s , i got a really amazing job when my professor asked me , if i was interested in coming to haiti and the secret societies that were <unk> the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the poison that was used to make <unk> .
and to give you a sense of how to give a sense , i had to think about this remarkable belief of knowledge and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
on the contrary , it &apos;s kind of a complex worldview .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i were to ask you , the great stanford line , what would you say ?
strategic , islam , buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent is constantly breathing , because the presumption was that there was no religious belief , of course , there was one and <unk> , just the arm of these very limited religious thoughts , during the tragic world of <unk> .
but what &apos;s going to be so interesting is this living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living machine provided the ghosts .
the spirits can be <unk> by the great water , responding to the rhythm of dance to establish the soul of the living tag so that the <unk> for a brief ring moment for a brief <unk> moment .
the <unk> would say , &quot; you know , you &apos;re going to be the church , and you &apos;re talking about god . &quot;
we dance in temple and become god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed , you &apos;re going to be taken by the spirit . how can you make damage ?
you see this amazing demonstrations : <unk> in a <unk> , which is <unk> charcoal without combustion <unk> , an astonishing user of the mind that is changing the body so that this is <unk> when it gets into a state of extreme arousal .
now , from all the people i &apos;ve met , the <unk> from sierra nevada de <unk> in <unk> , the most extraordinary .
<unk> the old <unk> civilization , which is the heart institute of colombia , and in the cases of the members of the group , that people went to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones who were never conquered by the <unk> .
at the end of the day , you &apos;re going to be ruled by a ritual priesthood . the education of education is very extraordinary .
the boys are sequestered at age three and four years from their families , and in a <unk> world of darkness , in <unk> at the base of glaciers for 18 years , and two moments of pregnant , to <unk> the nine months of pregnancy , they &apos;re now spending <unk> in the lap of their <unk> mother &apos;s lap .
and over that entire time , they &apos;re introduced to the values of their society , values that maintain the claim that their prayers and their prayers , the cosmic -- or we could tell the ecological -- or we could tell the ecological .
at the end of this amazing endowment , you &apos;ll just take one day and look out in your life at the age of 18 years , at the age of 18 years , you see a traffic . and in this <unk> moment of the first light , when the sun begins to radiation , all of a sudden , everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstract , all of a sudden , everything you &apos;ve learned in the abstract , all of a sudden , all you &apos;ve learned in the abstract .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you have to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers and say that we are the younger brothers for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition is very important .
whenever we think of advanced and landscape , we &apos;re adding either <unk> and the old rumor of the truly wild <unk> , which is in its simplification of a <unk> thought , or the other hand , and say , these people are more connected to nature than we do .
so , in contrast , they &apos;re neither <unk> , they &apos;re not going to go away from the <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be a lot of space in the <unk> <unk> of tibet , or the cold winds of tibet , but you still have yet , through time and ritual , a mysterious <unk> of the earth that doesn &apos;t exist on the idea of being close to being close to the ground , but in a far more serious intuition , the idea that the earth is going to exist , because it &apos;s going to be <unk> into human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid out of the andes saying that the mountain is a <unk> , which is , or your destiny , is going to be a whole bunch of other people , and a different relationship with that resource , or this place , as a child from montana , that a mountain is a bunch of rocks .
if he &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , it &apos;s irrelevant .
the interesting thing is the metaphor , which is the relationship between the individual and nature .
i grew up in the forests of <unk> colombia , and believed that these forests are there to be <unk> .
that led me to another person , as my friends under the <unk> , who believe that these forests of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> are spirits who are living in the world , who you &apos;re living in the world , are ghosts that you would be involved in your <unk> .
now , if you start looking at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of your extraordinary discoveries , for example , these plant .
it &apos;s a picture i just took last april in the northwest of the amazon .
this is <unk> , which many of you have heard of , the most powerful <unk> spreads from the repertoire of the aral sea .
so what makes me so fascinating is not just the most reliable potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s really created by two different sources . on the one hand , there &apos;s these <unk> <unk> , which is a series of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> of serotonin , which are very similar to the serotonin , <unk> and <unk> .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> , how you &apos;ve seen this stuff , these mutations that you &apos;re going to make in different ways also .
now , this <unk> <unk> is about to become like a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> image and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to make distortion of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have done with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in mexico . i said that you weren &apos;t going to be able to <unk> these <unk> as <unk> , because that &apos;s where you feel the implications , you &apos;re not going to be there to experience the <unk> .
but the thing about hyena is that they can &apos;t be taken off in the human gut , of course , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
you can only get into contact with several other chemicals that are called the mao <unk> .
now , the amazing thing is , the <unk> that are in the <unk> are actually <unk> of exactly the way that you are necessary to <unk> the <unk> . ask yourself , so you ask yourself .
how can these people from a non-profit from 80,000 species of plants that are <unk> plants that are able to make a little bit of a <unk> version , so that the whole thing is larger than the sum of its parts ?
we use this great euphemism , trial and errors , which is a bit of a conversation .
but you ask the indians to say , &quot; the plant speaks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , have 17 mutations of <unk> that you &apos;re all going to see at large distances in the forest , which is our eyes as a species .
and then you ask them how they looked at their <unk> and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something about plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out you put each of the 17 variants at <unk> and you sing in a different <unk> .
now , that doesn &apos;t give you a ph.d. at harvard , but it &apos;s much more interesting than <unk> .
now , the problem with the problem is that even those of us who have the cost of parenting , they look at them as <unk> and <unk> , but it &apos;s kind of constrained to the past , as the real world , is our world , it &apos;s our world .
so , the fact is that , in the 20th century , you can &apos;t remember the 20th century or technological innovations , but rather than an era where we were able to compete and have the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity on earth either active or passive . so the problem isn &apos;t the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem isn &apos;t the technology .
the <unk> are not less to be less than the <unk> and the spiritual tasks , when the americans stop to be americans , when she horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology , the integrity of <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of the regime .
and wherever you have in the world , you &apos;ll discover that these cultures are not the doom , these are dynamically living peoples , whose existence by <unk> forces , whose existence is <unk> by <unk> forces , which is <unk> by their capacity to the <unk> , and it &apos;s been <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , from <unk> , a people that lived in the <unk> sea .
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m going to make a lot of work , you &apos;ll see the ugly face of political domination .
you know , the genocide , which is extinction extinction extinction extinction , but the <unk> , the destruction , the destruction of people &apos;s lives , not only not only not harmful , but general and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you don &apos;t have any of it in a flat level .
i &apos;d been traveling with a young colleague 6,000 miles from <unk> to lhasa , and only when i went to lhasa , i saw the face behind the statistics of the statistics that you hear about , 6,000 <unk> monuments that have been killed in rubble and ashes , 1.2 million people during the cultural revolution .
the father of this young boy was identified as followers of the <unk> lama .
that meant that during the chinese invasion , he was going to be killed .
his uncle editor with her holiness in the diaspora that people brought in nepal .
his mother was imprisoned to be a punishment for -- for the crime .
it was taken at the age of two years ago in prison to hide under their <unk> , because she couldn &apos;t live without it .
the sister that <unk> these brave , was brought into a <unk> .
one day she accidentally stepped onto a <unk> <unk> , and for those <unk> , she had a hard time for seven years .
the suffering can be completely <unk> , but the <unk> spirit of humans is something <unk> .
and at the end , we &apos;re really dealing with a choice . do we want to be in a <unk> world of <unk> , or in a <unk> world of biodiversity ?
margaret <unk> , the great anthropologist said , before she died , it &apos;s your biggest fear that as we go towards a thread , self-cleaning , <unk> worldview , we would be able to see the entire range of human imagination , but that we would be able to see one day of the human imagination , and forgotten , that we would have a dream of a dream .
and it &apos;s humbling to think that our species might exist for 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution that brought us agriculture , and at that moment the <unk> of <unk> , the poetry of <unk> through the <unk> of priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and <unk> -- just 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely 300 years old .
now , this shallow story doesn &apos;t tell me that we all have answers to the challenges that we face in the ensuing millennia .
and if we look at these projections after the human rights , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and in that song we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be the possibility of what we &apos;re : people with high consciousness that are aware that all human beings and gardens have to be avoided , and there &apos;s great moments of optimism . and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph i took at the northern end of the <unk> when i went to the <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful history of his grandfather .
the <unk> government isn &apos;t always very good with the inuit , and during the <unk> years , the <unk> of our domination , they were forced to move into neighborhoods .
the grandfather &apos;s grandmother &apos;s grandmother &apos;s grandmother .
the family who was afraid of his life , he took all the guns and all the tools .
now you have to know that the shouldn &apos;t have fear before the cold , and they use them to their advantage .
the <unk> of their volunteers were originally taken from fish that were edited in <unk> .
the man &apos;s grandfather didn &apos;t die before the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> out , leaving his pants out of <unk> and <unk> into his hand , and when the feces started to pollinate , he shaped them into the shape of a <unk> .
it was <unk> saliva on the sides of the wheelhouse , and when it was completely frozen , he got a dog with it .
he <unk> the dog , and he &apos;s got a builder , took the skeleton of the dog and sped up with a <unk> , <unk> a different dog and <unk> across the <unk> with the <unk> .
you can do something out of anything .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the world &apos;s resistance and all the native americans in the world .
the <unk> government gave us the <unk> in april in 1999 , the complete control of an area that is bigger than california and texas combined .
it &apos;s our new home and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s an independent area . they control all of them .
an amazing example of how a nation , a state that can search for the world to be able to look for its people and reach .
and finally , i think it &apos;s quite obvious , at least for those of us who have been to these distant goals of earth , realizing that they &apos;re not away at all .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that &apos;s been <unk> in the past , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our own children are part of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to do at national geographic is we believe that politicians never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not serious , but we believe that storytelling can change the world and so we &apos;re probably going to be the best institution for storytelling in the world .
send nations : we send our <unk> .
our magazines will be read by millions .
and we &apos;re doing a series of travel into the <unk> that we &apos;re using to places of our audience of such cultural wonders , that this world is going to be <unk> and hopefully , one after the other <unk> of the imagery : that this world has earned to exist in various ways that the wisdom of all people can do to our shared well-being .
thank you .
what i first learned to you , as quickly as possible , is the basic work , a new technology that we &apos;re doing microsoft as part of a value just a year ago just a year ago , and it &apos;s a environment where they can either interact with huge amounts of visual input .
we &apos;re seeing many , many variations on digital photographs here that you can seamlessly and continually <unk> , <unk> , in a way , <unk> , in any way , to new way of doing a way that you can do . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we look at how big these names are , or how big the images are .
most of them are digital pictures of a camera , but this one here is a scan from the <unk> and it &apos;s in an area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only thing that is the performance of a system like this , is the number of pixels on its screen in every moment , it has also a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , an example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from dickens . each column is a chapters .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like that to really show that this is a true representation of happiness and no image .
maybe this is an artificial way of reading a <unk> .
i didn &apos;t recommend it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a edition from the guardian .
every big picture is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you the pleasure and the good experience of the good experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of a medium with several orders .
we &apos;ve also done something about the corner of this particular edition of the guardian .
we have designed a wrong display with very high levels that are much higher than at a normal display , and we added extra content .
if you want to see the functions of this cars , you can see them here .
or , other models , or even a technical creation .
and this is really , really these ideas , these limitations for the available space on the screen .
we hope that that doesn &apos;t mean <unk> and other nonsense -- that should not be necessary .
of course , this is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time here , except for saying that we &apos;re going to contribute to that area .
but these are all roads in the united states .
<unk> on the top of the nasa image of nasa .
now let &apos;s take a look at something else .
now , this is even live on the internet . you can <unk> it .
this is a project called <unk> that really connects to two different technologies .
the one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research about <unk> , which is from noah to washington , from the university of washington , on the <unk> of steve <unk> on the <unk> .
and rick <unk> von microsoft research was done . a very good collaboration .
so this is live on the internet . it &apos;s powered by <unk> .
and you can see that if we create this kind of views that we can use through images and experience that experience of <unk> .
but the spatial orientation of images is actually in fact .
the <unk> have taken these pictures together into the real room where these recordings that were all close to the <unk> <unk> in the canadian <unk> expressway , and you can see here elements of <unk> slides or <unk> <unk> , and these things , all of these <unk> slides , or <unk> , and these things were all <unk> in relationship .
i don &apos;t know exactly if i have time to show you other environments .
there are the ones that are much more inclusive .
i &apos;d like to show one of the <unk> <unk> of noa , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> that we &apos;ve been working on in the summer to show you what i think it really is the punchline of this technology , which is not so obvious when you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers of lawyers .
this is a <unk> of the cathedral of the cathedral , which is represented with images of flickr rollers , just give them notre dame in flickr , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in t-shirts and on the <unk> and so on .
so all of these are <unk> , and all of you are all facing the way in relation to each other .
and we can navigate this very simple way .
i mean , you know , i &apos;m going to work at microsoft work at microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the reception here .
and i suppose you can see that there are many different types of cameras : everything is done by the <unk> to professional <unk> , a fairly large number of them that are all cartesian in that environment .
and if you can , i &apos;ll find some of the strange ones .
many of you are from faces , etc .
there &apos;s a series of photographs here -- here you are .
this is actually a poster of notre dame that was recorded properly .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of that environment .
the point here is that we can do things with social networking , and it &apos;s now going to be collected from all of the folds -- from all the collective memories of how , visual the earth -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these pictures are connected to each other , and it creates something larger than the sum of parts .
you get a model that emerges from all over the earth .
now consider this as the continuation of the work of stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s going through the complexity where people are using it , grows and use their benefits to the users of using application .
their own pictures are going to be tagged with metadata , which have a different person .
when somebody has done the effort and all of these sacred comments , and you know , who all of you are , then my photo from the <unk> <unk> suddenly <unk> all of these data , and i can use them as a place to dive into this room , and to go through a kind of <unk> <unk> of the other people &apos;s use of other people .
and of course , all of these are the most powerful virtual virtual models of any interesting part of the earth that are not only given by <unk> or satellite and so on , but by collective memory .
thank you .
do i get them right ? their software requires that at a certain point , within the next few years , all the images that are being used by somebody in the world are going to be connected ?
yes . she doesn &apos;t do anything else than discovering .
and if you want to do it in between the images .
and she does this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting when you think of the <unk> of the <unk> information that has many of these images .
how if you do a <unk> for pictures , where you put it , and the text of the website contains a lot of information about what &apos;s that image .
but what if the image is connected to all of their images ?
it &apos;s the scope of <unk> <unk> and the amount that makes it really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
gee , that &apos;s really incredible . congratulations .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of things from my book , as i hope , in unison with other things that you &apos;ve heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to make a few connections , if you &apos;re not noticed that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; no <unk> . &quot;
the official <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western societies .
the official <unk> works so that when our goal is maximize the maximize of our citizens , it &apos;s all about the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for that is that freedom is good , valuable , sense , a <unk> geneticist of human rights .
if people have freedom , each of us is about to do the things that compose our democracies and no one has to decide for us .
the way to maximize freedom is choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more that they have .
this is , i think , deeply immersed in our water , that it &apos;s not going to be a sense in the sense that it would be in the sense .
and it &apos;s also embedded in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what &apos;s going to allow us to modern work .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
there &apos;s 175 <unk> in my supermarket , if you don &apos;t <unk> the 10 different extra <unk> and 12 <unk> that you could buy a big array of your <unk> <unk> , in the unlikely case , that none of the arrows in the store is right for you .
so that &apos;s what the supermarket is .
and then you go to the <unk> business for a stereo -- speaker , <unk> , a radio shack , radio , <unk> . and in this one electronics business , there are so many <unk> plants .
we can put together millions of different <unk> strains of the components that are offered in that one store .
they have to admit that this is a great choice .
in other realms -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , you could have taken every phone , you wanted to have the long as long as it came from 100 bell .
you &apos;ve rented your phone . you don &apos;t bought it . <unk> <unk> .
one consequence was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
we now have an infinite selection of phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are the mobile phones of the future .
my favorite one is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and crème <unk> .
and if you haven &apos;t seen that in your business , you can be secure that you &apos;re going to be soon soon .
and what it does is it makes people walk into business and ask that question .
now you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , not too much .
in other aspects of life that are much more illuminating than the buy of objects , the same explosion of choices .
health -- it &apos;s no longer the case in the united states , and the doctor tells them what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , we could make a do , or we could make b .
one has these benefits and risk .
h has these benefits and risk . what do you want to do ?
and they say , &quot; doc , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says a has the benefits and risk and b has the benefits and risk .
what do you want to do ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , doc , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
now , the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift of the burden of choices for the meeting of choices of someone who knows something -- <unk> the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing , and secure ill , and that &apos;s not in the best constitution , and that &apos;s not in the best constitution .
there &apos;s a tremendous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like you and me , if you think about it , doesn &apos;t make any sense , because we don &apos;t buy them .
why are you going to advertise us if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is , you guys expect the next morning and ask for a change of the prescription .
now , a question of how our identity is now a question of how this slide is going to show .
we don &apos;t approve identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re going to rethink ourselves as many as we want to do .
which means that every day when you wake up at the morning , you have to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time when the <unk> was , almost everybody had one of them , and they were able to <unk> as quickly as they could , and then they got children as quickly as they could .
the only true choice was &quot; who , not when , and not what she did after it .
nowadays , it &apos;s all easy to have .
i teach great intelligent students , and i give them 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re busy with other things , they ask themselves , &quot; should i marry or not ? should i get married ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids , or just a career ?
they &apos;re all kinds of questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions of questions about whether that means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to give you and don &apos;t have good grade in my class .
and in fact , you should do that . these are important questions .
work -- we &apos;re blessed , as carl <unk> , with the technology that gives us each every minute of every single day of every place on the planet -- to the <unk> hotel .
by the way , there &apos;s a corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about where the <unk> works .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is that incredible freedoms of choice we have to make choices in terms of work , again , again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our kids playing football , and we have our cell phone on the one hand , and our blackberry on other waist , and our laptop probably on our lap .
and even if you &apos;re all shut up , every minute in which we &apos;re going to be using our child during the age of a <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to be wondering , &quot; should i think of that call ?
should i answer that email ? should i write this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to be the experience of your child &apos;s experience , very different than it would have been .
anywhere where we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world that we were living in .
so i want to say that there were some choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world that we now live in now .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is &quot; yes . &quot;
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to tell you about what &apos;s going on .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on humans .
a effect , dignified way , is that it &apos;s not going to go .
so many options you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide to do it at all .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of this , a study of investment in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> from <unk> , the gigantic <unk> of about one million collaborators and about 2,000 different noes .
and what she found was a 10 percent of the employer , which was the participation by two percent .
they are offering 50 percent of them -- 10 percent less staff than if they would only offer five . why ?
because there are 50 <unk> who are available to choice , it &apos;s so hard to decide which you should choose to do it in tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , it &apos;s never going to be .
you know , that &apos;s not only that you have to eat people &apos;s food if you &apos;re going to go into the retirement , because you don &apos;t have enough money to you , it means making decisions so hard that they miss large amounts of your employer .
they don &apos;t give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars per year on the <unk> , which would have been happy to reproduce their contribution .
<unk> is a consequence of many choices .
and i think it &apos;s for that the world looked like this .
they want to make the decision really , if it &apos;s all eternity , right ?
they don &apos;t want to vote for the wrong towers , or even the wrong <unk> .
so , this is a effect . the other effect is that even when we overcome paralysis and make a decision , we end less happy with the result of choice than if we had the opportunity to decide between fewer possibilities .
and there &apos;s several reasons for that .
one of them is <unk> by the large hadron collider , if you buy one of them , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and that <unk> is already perfect ? it &apos;s just to imagine that they have a different decision , and what happens is that <unk> <unk> , and what happens is that <unk> <unk> , and what happens is that <unk> .
the more opportunities there is , the easier is it &apos;s not going to be anything at all for the choices that you make .
second , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has made a big point today by telling how very much the way we evaluate things , depending on what we compare .
well , if there &apos;s a lot of alternative to think , it &apos;s easy to imagine each other of alternatives that you &apos;re afraid , that makes you less happy with the alternative that you &apos;ve picked .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who don &apos;t have new yorkers , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should have thought .
here &apos;s a couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
beautiful beach . great day . you &apos;ve got it all for yourself .
what could be better ? &quot; &quot; man &quot; man thought , &quot; it &apos;s august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could park in front of my house . &quot;
and he &apos;s looking at two weeks from the thought that he has missed the opportunity to have a great parking lot .
<unk> lower the satisfaction that we preserve through our selection , even though what we &apos;ve chosen is fantastic .
and the more opportunities there are , the more attractive properties of these choices are going to be in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
now , this cartoon makes a few statements .
it &apos;s going to be a statement about it , and maybe about doing things as well .
but one of the most important point that he &apos;s doing is always decide for one thing , don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like lots of attractive properties , and it &apos;s going to do what they &apos;re going to do less limited .
third , <unk> of expectations .
that &apos;s what i met when i wanted to exchange my jeans .
i &apos;m wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in which it gave it a bit of a time , and they bought them , and they were incredibly <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they carried them long enough , they started &quot; okay , they started &quot; okay . &quot;
so , to buy new jeans for many years from the <unk> of the old , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple jeans , here &apos;s my height . &quot;
and the seller said , &quot; do you want <unk> , <unk> or high ?
do you want to buttons or <unk> ? stone or acid ?
do you want to attract jeans with holes ?
you want to go down a long time , <unk> , blah blah blah ... &quot; and so on .
my jaw was down , and after i recovered , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like the way that the only way it was the only way . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour all of these damn jeans , and i got the business -- and i tell the truth -- with the best comment i ever had .
i had better . all those choices allowed me to have it better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try and explain it myself .
the reason i felt worse about that , with all of these available opportunities , my expectations of what a good little jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have concrete expectations than it was only in a way .
when she came in 100 species , damn , one of them should have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to get to what i expected , and what i had was disappointing in comparison to what i expected .
it &apos;s going to add from opportunities to people &apos;s lives , the expectations of expectations are going to be about how good these possibilities are going to be .
and that leads to less satisfaction with the results , even though the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows that , because if they would , they all know what it &apos;s going to be here .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it was all worse than anything worse than anything worse than anything worse , it was possible for people to make experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
now , in the world where we live in -- we &apos;re affluent , human citizens , with perfection as expectation -- the best for that you can ever hope to hope as well as you expect it .
they &apos;re never going to be comfortable because their expectations , my expectations , are <unk> .
the secret to the <unk> -- that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all come -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- i was married with a woman , and she &apos;s really wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done it better . i didn &apos;t shave .
but <unk> is not always a bad thing .
in addition , a consequence of <unk> , if you have a way to buy , is that if you &apos;re happy , and you wonder why who is responsible , and you ask yourself , why is responsible . the world is responsible . what would you have done ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one the burrow , and they ask why , who is responsible ?
is it clear that the answer to the question is : it &apos;s .
you could have done it better .
there &apos;s a hundred different types of jeans in <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for errors .
and so when people make decisions , and even if the findings of choices are good , they &apos;re feeling frustrated about them , they accuse itself .
we have in the world of depression in the world in the last generation .
i believe a <unk> -- not the only one , but a <unk> <unk> at this explosion of depression , and it &apos;s also suicide , is that people have learned the cooperation , because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences , they think it would be their fault .
and so , this is the <unk> that it &apos;s very important to us , and we feel bad , and we feel bad .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> , which is one that we all hold for right , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that is better than not , but it doesn &apos;t follow that more choice is better than something selection .
there &apos;s a magical crowd . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve missed that point of view of this point of our collective relations .
now , as a matter of question -- i &apos;m almost finished -- as a kind of question , the thing about thinking is , what all these choices allow you to be in the developed societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we have heard of many of them , whose problem is not too much selection .
your problem is that you have too little .
so the things that i &apos;m talking about are a curious problem of modern , rich societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and frustrating is : steve <unk> showed you yesterday about how this expensive and hard to <unk> car seats are not helping . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not easy that they don &apos;t help .
they &apos;re actually aching .
it &apos;s about us that we are worse .
if something of what people are allowed to make choices that allow us to make choices that allow people to have little choice , it would not only change the lives of people , but our dignity would be improved .
economists call this a <unk> application .
it &apos;s going to be worried that it &apos;s all better -- not only the poor -- because all of these big choices .
finally , read this cartoon , and , a <unk> person , says , &quot; ah ! what do this fish know ?
you know , there &apos;s no way you can do it . &quot;
<unk> fantasy , a <unk> view of the world -- and that is the way i read it first .
the more i thought about it , the more i came to the thought that the fish knows something .
because the truth is that if you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paralysis .
when you break the <unk> , so that everything is possible , you &apos;re going to go through the satisfaction .
it takes the paralysis and lower happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost with perfect security to limited -- potentially for fish , definitely for us .
but the <unk> is a recipe for misery , and , i suspect , catastrophe .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects earlier about the human genome and what that could mean , and about the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re going to do a new point : we &apos;ve digitized biology , and now we &apos;re trying to get through digital code into a new phase of biology by designing new lives and build .
we &apos;ve always tried to ask great questions .
what &apos;s life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists have tried to understand and do it on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different approaches to put it into the minimum components .
we &apos;ve lost almost 20 years . when we &apos;ve sequenced the <unk> , the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world of biology .
now , let &apos;s try to ask whether we can be able to live lives or whether we can make new life , from this digital universe ?
that &apos;s the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , which is the smallest genome of a species that could replicate itself in the lab , and we tried to be able to do that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it to about a hundred genes from the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at these metabolic map , which is very simple compared to our -- trust me , that &apos;s simple . but if we look at all of these genes that we can eliminate one after the other , it &apos;s very unlikely that it would lead to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to leave this chromosome , that chromosome is actually allowing us to vary the individual components and ask some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we get a chromosome ?
did it make these chemistry to create these really large molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
one chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps at the center of life were exponentially .
now , our ability to write genetic code has evolved very slowly , but it &apos;s still rising . and our final point , now is going to be in a exponential curve .
we started with this 15 years ago .
it actually took a couple of years ago with a <unk> review before we did the first experiments .
it turns out to be very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world to make the little pieces of dna , 30 to 50 letters long , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you make a piece of power , the longer you make a piece of power .
so we had to create a new method that we created these little bits and fix the errors .
that was our first trial , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we built little bits , we did a <unk> , and we had a dna molecule by about 5,000 letters .
the exciting stage , when we took this piece of <unk> chemical and gave it into a bacterium , and the bacterium started to read the genetic code , and we made viral particles .
the viral particles were taken off the cells and came back and killed e. .
in recently , i talked to the oil industry , and they said that they were going to make this model .
they were laughing more than they do this .
so we think that this is a situation where the subject is actually able to build your hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go a lot further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome . it has more than <unk> letters code , so we thought we were able to build it in cassette samples from the size of the virus that we could vary the height of the virus in order to understand what &apos;s the individual components of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , that digital information is really going to be able to be .
when we first came to the genome project , the <unk> was at a mistake per 10,000 base .
we found 30 mistakes , and if we used the original sequence , it would never have been possible .
part of the design is to make pieces of the five letters long , and that with other <unk> bits to build smaller <unk> to build smaller <unk> to build these fit into the process of building these intersections . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ;
we &apos;ve installed unique elements here .
you may have heard that we have <unk> .
think about that : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of these letters -- these letters encode about 20 amino acids ; and there &apos;s a single purpose of each of these amino acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we only got signed .
some people were frustrated that it was not poetry .
we built the plays so that we could just break it with enzymes . there are enzymes that repair these , and again .
and we started making pieces , starting with the <unk> of the five to <unk> letters , putting these together to <unk> , to make these <unk> to <unk> , to <unk> .
in each step , we created these pieces in the greenhouse system that we could sequence them , because we were trying to sequence a very robust process what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;ve tried to get to the point of view .
so , that looks like a <unk> .
when we get to these really big pieces -- with 100,000 base pairs -- then they &apos;re not going to grow in e. coli . it &apos;s constantly improving all the opportunities of modern molecular biology , and so we &apos;re going to do other puzzles .
we knew about a mechanism of <unk> <unk> , which is used biology to fix dna that can map these pieces .
here &apos;s an example of it . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million rads of radiation .
you &apos;re looking at the top field that his chromosome falls apart .
ten to 24 hours later , everything was all over the way it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be totally dried , they can even live in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely certain that life can exist in space and moving on looking for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are lots of things out there .
here &apos;s a <unk> of the molecule that we created by using these processes -- actually , we &apos;ve only used <unk> with the right design of the pieces of pieces of pieces of pieces of pieces of pieces of bits .
that &apos;s not a <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can actually see it with the <unk> .
these are shots over a duration of six seconds .
that &apos;s the publication that we &apos;ve only done recently .
this is about <unk> &apos;s code of <unk> code . it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that &apos;s ever been created by people .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we were going to print it with a $ 10 <unk> of 10 and without theft , it would be <unk> , just to put these genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ?
obviously , it &apos;s a virus that is very simple with a virus . it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s simple when you &apos;re in <unk> like we are , you just take the nucleus out and give you another , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve all heard about the clone .
in <unk> , the chromosome is embedded in the cell , but only recently we &apos;ve shown that you can do a full transplant of one cell from a cell to the other , and it can be activate .
we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . in fact , these two are both of us as humans and mice . we gave several <unk> to this chromosome , and it was very surprising when we put it in a cell -- and it was very surprising when we put it in a cell -- and it was very surprising when we put it in a cell -- and they &apos;re going to appreciate our very <unk> graphs here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought that here is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to bring the process to a little wider .
that &apos;s the <unk> of evolution here .
we &apos;re finding all sorts of species here , or a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , each time a species in only one second of a second .
so people that think about evolution as a gene that has been changed at a time , a lot of the biology .
there are enzymes called the asphaltenes that are actually called dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell has no ; the chromosomes that we have .
it was <unk> in the cell and realized the other chromosome as a foreign material , and we ended up with a new chromosome with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we had .
and after a very brief period , it had lost all the characteristics of species , and <unk> completely into a new species based on the new software that we gave into the cell .
all the proteins changed the membranes -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we started .
it might sound like <unk> <unk> , but we can , by changing the <unk> , changing things quite dramatic .
now i realized that this is not the <unk> -- that is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i have argued that we might be able to create a new shape of the cambrian blast in which there could be massive new forms based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we &apos;re about nine billion people in the next 40 years in the next 40 years .
to put it in my context , i was born in 1946 .
today , three people on this planet has been living in the year , within 40 years , it &apos;s going to be four .
we have problems with food technology , with fresh and clean water , medicine , for five billion people .
it &apos;s going to be a challenge for 9 / 11 .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million barrels a day .
when we think about biological processes , or any process to replace that , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material that goes into the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from all over the world , a database of about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that these are the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and you look at the diversity that came out of it .
we &apos;re going to be looking at the limitations of biological reality , and those of our imagination .
now , we have this technology today because of these fast neurons to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we have the opportunity to build a great robot to build the millions of chromosomes a day .
so , if you can imagine these 20 million different genes , or build these processes to optimize <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can change a small team more molecular than the last 20 years .
and it &apos;s only <unk> selection . we can <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so on .
this is a picture of the fact that we &apos;re working with , where you actually sit down and design new species on the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t know what it is going to look like . we know exactly how the genetic code is going to look like .
we &apos;re focusing on the fourth generation of the fourth generation .
they have seen corn about corn , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;re going to have the intensity of the <unk> and third generation , which is going to have a lot of higher value , like <unk> or different kinds of crustaceans .
but , as we think , the only way we think , the only way that biology has a huge impact on food or the limitation of their availability is when we see co2 as an opera , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go to that path , and so we &apos;re working on cells that go to that path .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first to be the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months .
sunlight and carbon are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is an organism that we described in 1996 .
it &apos;s living in the deep sea , about <unk> miles in almost <unk> <unk> .
it changes carbon dioxide in methane by using hydrogen as a source of energy .
we can study whether we can use <unk> carbon , which is simply going to be brought to <unk> , the carbon dioxide in greenhouse gases to drive this process .
within a brief period of time , we could be able to solve one of the most fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> targets like cup of the <unk> industry , right . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where otherwise you could do this at ted , where ?
but as we &apos;re working on this , we &apos;re working on the same way that we use to use the development of vaccines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year on the back , and we have a dollar too little when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that &apos;s going to be changed by planting <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what the future might look like with changes today , with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> , and maybe <unk> .
we &apos;re light light years away from people . our goal is that we have a chance to survive for a long time to do that . thank you very much .
at the last ted conference , i was an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to explain to you how the machine works .
so now it &apos;s a lot . and for all those who haven &apos;t been there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that &apos;s ever been coded -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
his job is to create the conditions that are less than a <unk> second after the universe of the universe -- and that &apos;s about 600 million times in a second .
it &apos;s just breathtaking ambitious .
this is the machine underneath geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in detectors .
i work . he calls atlas detector -- 44 meters in the width , 22 meters in diameter .
this is a spectacular image of the atlas in the construction , so you can see the scale .
on september 10 last year , the machine was running for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it &apos;s got a huge amount of processing in the control group .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which is all the way around the lhc , and then , with a part of the lhc , to put a rain of particles on the detector .
in other words , when we saw this image at the 10 september , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is making the biggest <unk> , or this , when someone went to the google page and the front of it was that .
it means that we had a cultural impact on the scientific side .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to do with these wires here -- these golden wires here .
these wires conduct <unk> when the machine goes on to <unk> .
now , the engineers among them are going to look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that because if you look very close , you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
so in minus 2,600 degrees , colder than the space is between stars , these wires can get tension .
in one of the connections , between <unk> magnets in the galapagos , there was a <unk> .
it turns out the wires burst and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this was the result .
now , this is all more beautiful when you think that the magnets goes over 20 tons , and it &apos;s shifted by about 30 centimeters .
so we set out about 50 of the magnets .
and they had to take them out of what we did .
we <unk> them , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back on their path .
at the end of march , the lhc will be back again .
we &apos;re going to turn him down , and expect the first data in june or july , and put our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now , of course , in a way , these accidents have once again the debate about the value of science and <unk> at such limitations . it &apos;s easy to calm something down .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard , the fact that we go beyond our limitations , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words a english scientist . <unk> <unk> , who i suspect when he was the <unk> experiments of his <unk> <unk> , his apprentice , his apprentice , he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human spirit as evidence that our scientific beliefs are more probable , and that there are no new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i &apos;m a novelist .
books is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my large , lifetime love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect anyone to change .
but today , the recent studies of my life , and my career , that led me to this piece of work , to really rethink my relationship to this work .
this funny event was that i wrote a book recently -- a biography called <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> -- that , when all my previous books came out of all the previous books in the world , and a large <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i &apos;m going to be treated like i &apos;m going to be treated as if i got to the doom .
seriously -- the doom <unk> !
so , for instance , you get to look at me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you know that you &apos;re never going to be able to get rid of these success ?
did you not fear that she could <unk> your entire life and create a book again , which anybody in the world ? not again ? <unk> <unk> ?
okay , that &apos;s really obsolete .
but it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remember that i was about 20 years ago when i first realized that i was going to be a writer with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> did you not be afraid to have success ?
do you not worry that you kill the humiliation of a <unk> ?
you don &apos;t worry that you live this craft for your life , and you never get something that you &apos;re going to die in a <unk> dreams -- your mouth filled with the bitter lama of the failure ? <unk> <unk> <unk> ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : <unk> yeah .
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all of these things .
and i had always been .
and i got a lot more stuff that no one would know .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but when i think about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about , why ?
is that secret ?
is it possible that it &apos;s going to be afraid of doing the job that he feels to do with the job of doing the work ?
and what &apos;s going on with the creative activities that they &apos;re going to make us self-conscious about the reciprocal conditioning -- in a way , how do they do other jobs ?
my father , for instance , was chemist , and i can &apos;t remember him in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked to be a chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how are you going to do it with that ?
it just didn &apos;t happen , you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of chemists have not been given the reputation of <unk> <unk> people .
now , we might seem to have these kinds of calls , but not only the novelists , but the creative centers , seem to have these call to have a tendency to have a very dangerous conversation about being in general . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
all you need to do is to look at the bitter <unk> of really great minds from the 20th century , the young and often died of their own hand .
and even the ones that didn &apos;t actually have any <unk> property , actually , has been really neglected by their talents .
norman <unk> said to his death in his last interview : <unk> each of my books had a little bit further . <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s a extraordinary statement that you can do about your work .
but we don &apos;t even care , if we hear somebody such a thing , because we &apos;ve been familiar with this sort of statements for so long and collectively , that creativity and anxiety , of course , that creativity and anxiety somehow , of course , is <unk> and that art is -- always leads to the <unk> .
the question i &apos;d like to make everyone here is , is this idea of all right ?
you might feel like this ? because at only one inch , i don &apos;t feel with this notion at all .
i think it &apos;s outrageous .
and i find it dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch as you &apos;re going to go to the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative responsibilities .
and i definitely know that for me -- in my situation -- a very dangerous job , started to start this dark picture of the presumption -- especially in the fact that i was in my career in my career .
that means -- i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have more 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s very likely that all i &apos;m going to write from now about the world as the work , which is after the most successful success of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m saying it <unk> , because we &apos;re all kind of friends here -- it &apos;s probably that my greatest success of my greatest success .
oh , jesus , what a thought !
that &apos;s the kind of thought that someone can get someone to start at nine o &apos;clock in the morning to drink alaska , and i don &apos;t want that .
i &apos;d rather do that work that i love .
so the question is : how ?
and after a few days of the <unk> , i have to write to write , to write a kind of <unk> psychological design .
somehow , i have to find a way of thinking about a way of writing a secure distance , and my very natural <unk> of how the reaction is going to be to that .
while i was looking for models for the last year to do that , i &apos;ve been looking for in the past , and i &apos;ve tried to find other societies to see if they might be better or happy ideas about it than we have , as we can , how to help creative work , to deal with the emotional risks that are linked to creativity .
this quest led me into old greece and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle will close again .
but in the old greece and rome , people didn &apos;t believe that creativity comes from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of self-serving <unk> that was from distant , far-off source to humans -- from <unk> , unknown reasons .
the greeks called this jackson <unk> of creativity of creativity <unk> <unk> .
from socrates , he &apos;s known that he believed he had a <unk> that <unk> him out of nowhere .
the romans had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit , a <unk> genius . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that &apos;s great . the romans didn &apos;t really think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
they believed that a genius was this kind of magical <unk> creatures , which was believed that it &apos;s literally living in the walls of a <unk> -- about like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artist , in fact , were making invisible <unk> and the result of work .
that &apos;s brilliant -- there &apos;s it , there &apos;s the distance i talked about -- the psychological concoction that protect you from the consequences of your work .
and everybody knew that this worked , right ?
the artist of <unk> was in front of certain things , like , for instance , too much narcissism , right ?
when your work was clear , you didn &apos;t know anything for you . everybody knew that you had this <unk> genius that helped you .
when your work doesn &apos;t work -- not entirely your fault , right ?
everybody knew your genius was a little <unk> .
that &apos;s how the people in the west have been thinking about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea , and this big idea was : let &apos;s put the human individual into the center of the universe -- all of the gods and mysteries , and there &apos;s no room anymore for the <unk> creatures .
it &apos;s the beginning of the rational humanism , and people started to think that creativity came from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you &apos;ll hear people like this or these artists who call a genius -- instead of having a genius .
i have to tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think a convenient person to allow him to think he or she &apos;s like the <unk> , like the pelvis and the source of all divine , creative , creative , creative , creative , <unk> , infinite <unk> .
it &apos;s like someone to ask the sun .
the <unk> and distorted whole egos , and it creates all of these <unk> expectations of success .
i think this <unk> has been <unk> our artists in the last 500 years .
and if that &apos;s true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
perhaps too much of a mechanical understanding about the relationship of the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative .
perhaps not .
maybe we can &apos;t just <unk> the <unk> of 500 years ago in a <unk> lecture .
and there are certainly people in this audience that really <unk> scientific knowledge about the notion of -- basically -- <unk> , people <unk> and <unk> on their projects and so on .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you to that journey .
but the question i want to suggest is : why not ?
why not about that ?
because it &apos;s going to make a lot of meaning that i &apos;ve heard of , when it comes to explain the perfectly crazy <unk> of the creative process .
a process that has ever been -- like everybody who ever attempted to do something -- so in other words , everybody here -- not always <unk> .
in fact , he can feel sometimes <unk> .
i had a similar encounter recently , when i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> stone , which is now about 90 , but she told me that she had been working on in the <unk> in virginia , and she said she could feel and hear like a poem over the landscape .
she said it would be like a <unk> <unk> from air .
it &apos;s about the country on her own country .
it felt when it came , because it would get the earth under their feet to the quake .
she knew that she could only do in such a moment , and that was -- in her words -- <unk> running like the hell <unk> .
they ran like the hell to the house during this poem . it was only about how they could get quickly enough to a piece of paper and a pen , to get it when it could go through it , and put it on the sheet .
at other paint , she wasn &apos;t fast enough . she ran away and hurried and hurried , but she didn &apos;t get the house and she rolled the poem through her , and she used it . she said it would go on land and -- as she said -- <unk> after a different poet . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp;
and then there were those moments -- i &apos;ll never forget that -- she said that there were moments in which they were almost close to .
so she runs out to the house and looking for the poem and the poem goes through it , and she grabs a pen just as it goes through her and then -- she said -- it was like she would reach out of your other hand and get it .
and she grabs the poem on his tail and she moved it back into her body , and she picked it onto the piece of paper .
in these opportunities , the poem came out and <unk> on paper -- but backwards -- from the last word for the first .
when i heard that , i thought that <unk> is creepy -- that &apos;s exactly how my creative process is .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the channel .
i &apos;m a <unk> . i have to get up every day at the same time and sweat and sweating , and really awkward to me and really awkward <unk> .
but even i have this thing in my <unk> sometimes , sometimes that thing .
and i guess that many of you have done that too .
even i had been working , or ideas , from a source of me , which i really can &apos;t identify .
what &apos;s this thing ?
and how do we deal with it without losing our mind , but in fact , in the opposite of intellectual health ?
and for me , the best living example is how you can create that , the musicians of tom <unk> . i was allowed him to interview for a magazine .
we talked about this subject . and you know what ? most of his life was tom the embodiment of the <unk> modern artist , who tried to master these <unk> creative impulses that were being stuck in him and with them .
but then he got older and quiet . he told me that he had one day on a freeway to los angeles , and it changed everything for him .
he was working with high speed , when he suddenly hear a little bit of a tune , which is , as it is often held , and he wants to have it , and he wants to have it . she &apos;s <unk> . she &apos;s <unk> , but he can &apos;t touch it .
he didn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he didn &apos;t have a pencil , he didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
so he begins , this old blob of him , like <unk> i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;ll be haunted by this song on forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t get it . <unk> <unk> .
but instead of getting into panicked , he just stopped .
he ended up the whole leader , doing something completely new .
he just looked into the sky and said , &quot; <unk> sorry , can you see that i drive cars ? &quot;
i look at this as if i was going to finish a song ?
if you really want to exist , come back to a <unk> moment when i can take care of you .
if you don &apos;t , there &apos;s somebody else today .
and <unk> cohen cohen . <unk> <unk> .
his whole <unk> has changed .
not the work itself . it used to be as dark as it ever .
but the process , and the heavy <unk> that surrounds him , was removed as he was wearing the genius , where he didn &apos;t know , as a trouble , and he went out there , where he would be , and he found that it was not a <unk> , <unk> thing .
it could be a <unk> , <unk> , bizarre collaborations , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing that was not entirely tom .
when i heard that story , it has also been a little bit of the way i worked , and it was already saved me .
this is one that saved me when i was in the middle of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love , and i fell in one of these <unk> of <unk> in which we all fall when we &apos;re working on something and it doesn &apos;t work . you start thinking that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . that &apos;s the last book ever written .
it &apos;s not only bad , but the worst of all time .
i started thinking , i should just <unk> the project .
but then i remembered how tom was in the free sky , and i tried to do it .
so i took my view from the manuscript and i was talking to my comment on a blank corner of the room .
i said , &quot; <unk> listen , &quot; you know , you and i know , if this book isn &apos;t brilliant , it &apos;s not entirely my fault , right ?
because you see , i &apos;m all i have , i have no more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to show up here and have your benefits of it .
okay , but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;ll keep writing , because that &apos;s my job .
and i &apos;d like to leave you for my part of the jobs that i was here for my part of the jobs here .
because ... at the end , at the end , it &apos;s like this . before centuries , in the deserts of <unk> people with holy presidency and music , the hours have been introduced for hours -- until the dawn .
these were always great because the dancers were professional and they were fantastic .
but , again , very rarely , something special happened . one of the early warning was actually <unk> .
and i know you know what i mean , because i know you &apos;ve already seen such a performance in your life .
it was as though the time time and the dancer went through a kind of <unk> , and he didn &apos;t do anything else than he ever did before -- 1,000 nights before , but everything was happening together .
and all of a sudden , he was no longer human .
it was run by the inside and the bottom line through a <unk> fire .
as something happened at that , people knew what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and started singing : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god . <unk> . <unk> .
that &apos;s god , you know ?
historic historic <unk> : when the <unk> <unk> , they took that practice , and the pronunciation changed in the centuries of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which you still hear about <unk> and <unk> .
when a scientist in spain was doing something magical , something magical has done : <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , wonderful , <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> view of god .
and that &apos;s great because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the morning , when the dancers check himself and realizes that it &apos;s 11 o &apos;clock on a tuesday -- and he no longer have a <unk> of god into it .
it &apos;s only a <unk> <unk> with <unk> &apos;s knees , and maybe it &apos;s never going to be back to these altitudes .
and maybe one of god &apos;s never going to call any of god &apos;s name , when it turns out , but what do he then do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most extraordinary functions of a creative life .
but maybe it &apos;s not going to be so much <unk> if they didn &apos;t believe that the most significant aspects of their fortunes of them .
if you may just think that you &apos;re a <unk> -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> period of your life that are being passed on somebody else , if you &apos;re done with it .
when we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
and so i started thinking , and so i think with certainty in the past months , while i was working on the book , that &apos;s going to appear soon -- than the dangerous , dear , very expected <unk> of my <unk> success .
so what i have to say to myself is when i &apos;m crazy , it &apos;s not a fear .
don &apos;t be reliable .
just your job .
don &apos;t continue to be on your contribution , whatever it &apos;s going to be .
when your job is dance , dance .
now , if the stupid creative genius that put you on the side , for a brief moment , for a brief moment of miracle through your effort , then <unk> <unk> ! <unk> <unk> !
and if not , they even dance the dance .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you .
i believe that , and i feel like we should teach that .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you , just for you , just for the mere human love and the <unk> to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year i showed these two slides to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , which had been the size of the lower 48 states , to 40 percent of the lower 48 states .
but this is not very strong enough the seriousness of this particular problem because it &apos;s not showing the thickness of the ice .
in a sense , the arctic poses the <unk> heart of our global system .
it grows in winter and fall in the summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> what &apos;s happened in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is with red .
and as you can see , it &apos;s <unk> . this is the annual ice in the winter ; it &apos;s in the summer .
this is <unk> , five years old or older , almost like blood , which is <unk> out of the body here .
it &apos;s going to be gone from here to here .
this is a problem , because warming warming around the arctic ocean , in which there are large amounts of <unk> carbon , which is when it &apos;s <unk> , from microbes to the methane .
compared to the entire amount of <unk> substances in the atmosphere , it &apos;s going to double if we cross this critical point .
today , in some shallow lakes today , in alaska , in alaska of itself .
professor <unk> walter in alaska , in alaska , has traveled to another flat lake last winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how is it going to be called us .
and one reason is , this enormous decline of greenland is from north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume are significantly bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in southwest greenland .
if you want to know how the sea level goes through <unk> , you get into the ocean .
these rivers are going to be <unk> .
on the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
now , many month later researchers reported that the entire continent has now had a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , which is about a few <unk> , is very much in melt .
this is the equivalent of 20 foot <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see the top new lakes that were glaciers in front of a few years ago .
forty percent of all the people in the world have half of their <unk> .
in the andes , this glacier is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have been expanding .
but if you look at it , most of the drinking water is going to be <unk> .
in california , there was a 40 percent reduction in the sierra face of the sierra face .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions you read them are serious .
these vectors throughout the entire world has led to a dramatic increase in fire hydrant .
and the disasters in the world are in a really <unk> , and it never happens to be <unk> .
ten years in the last 30 years as well as in the <unk> <unk> .
this is a completely pointless <unk> .
when you look at this in the historical context , you can see what it is .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve created 70 million tons of co2 all 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day in the ocean .
look at the area of the eastern pacific market , from the american continent , and <unk> of the indian ocean basin , where there &apos;s a real decline in the sea floor in the ocean .
the biggest single factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and charcoal is the most beautiful biggest problem .
the united states are one of the two largest squatter submersibles , with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other <unk> .
but we &apos;re starting to see a change .
here are the ones that have been reported in the last few years with some green alternatives that have been proposed .
<unk> is a political argument in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have spent a <unk> dollar last month to promote clean charcoal , which is a contradiction in itself .
this picture reminded me of something .
in the christmas room , at me at home in tennessee , a billion tons of plastic bags .
you &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country of <unk> <unk> .
this was about christmas .
one of the commercials of <unk> at christmas was this .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , sad boys .
it &apos;s in skin and water in america , and it helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> continues to clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers stay in foam and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful thing is the leader of <unk> <unk> .
let me give you a very clear note , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , you don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
so the alliance for global two sets has started to live in . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
this is one part of her .
in the <unk> , we &apos;re seeing climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we put it to the supreme court , an agricultural <unk> , to bring a <unk> on the way to get the truth of charcoal .
in fact , coal is not dirty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- and it also smells good even good .
so , don &apos;t worry about the climate change .
let &apos;s put that to us .
<unk> charcoal , you &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , clean <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , burning from charcoal one of the main reasons of the global warming is that the remarkable clean material that you see here is changing everything .
look at this , this is the story , clean <unk> .
finally , the positive alternative starts with our economic challenge and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red thread that all of these together is our dependence on <unk> moss , like dirty coal and <unk> oil .
but now there &apos;s a bold , new solution to free ourselves from that <unk> .
<unk> america with 100 percent of clean electricity in the next 10 years .
a plan to bring america back to work , to help us make ourselves safer and help the global warming .
finally , a solution that is big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the key ways , our dependence of old , dirty fuels , that <unk> our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new energy system .
investment investment to create good paying jobs .
<unk> america . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s an old african saying , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come to , you go together . &quot;
we have to get a long time , and it &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to start to ask you to go back to your childhood when you were playing with <unk> .
as they realized how to tear the hands and <unk> it , they actually learn to think , and they actually learn to think and understand problems through understanding and changing the way that they understand and change the way it &apos;s going to work through and changing the <unk> of the same thing . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
spatial thinking is deeply linked to dealing with how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a scientist -- inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleague <unk> <unk> , i started to wonder : what if we could use computers , the instead of having a <unk> , which would be like a digital <unk> on a flat <unk> .
this question was so sophisticated that we decided to organize the answer to the answer , and <unk> .
in short , a <unk> is a interactive computer in the size of a football field .
you can move with your hand , you can look at each other , you can detect your movements , and you have a screen and you have a <unk> .
more importantly , you &apos;re more physically , why you can only move through the <unk> of the hands of hands and access .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to manipulation digital data .
and when these tools become more dramatic and a conscious mind for their movements , each other and the intricacies of our <unk> experiences with them , then we can start with the exploration of new and entertaining <unk> .
i &apos;ll start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> , and when i put it in a direction , the video will go back , when i put it into the other direction , it &apos;s going backwards .
and these interactive portraits take each other .
so when i put them side-by-side , they make interest .
when you &apos;re surrounded by you , you &apos;ll notice that , and you can get a little bit nervous .
and they feel also their movements and liking .
and a interesting outgrowth of the interactions that we started realizing was that we could apply everyday gestures on data , like color , how do you do it with liquids .
in this case we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to cast color in the middle , where they &apos;re going to be blended .
when we overdo it , we can make a little <unk> .
there are also some nice opportunities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we can give people the possibility of fast vaccine and see the results immediately .
here i am -- this is a series i created with a simple misunderstanding .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of mixture of <unk> and <unk> .
in fact , every round of applause happens to be <unk> letters , and as you &apos;re trying to form words , you &apos;re going to be able to pass through a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it gets again , and you have a new <unk> and new possibility .
thank you .
that &apos;s a few kids who came to a trip to the media lab , and i could move them to try it and take a video of it .
they really loved it .
one more interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; give words &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here are a couple of people who test it .
this is our ultimate <unk> down there on the right .
it turned out that he wanted to just stack up the <unk> .
so for him , they were only <unk> .
this is a interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
that &apos;s brain behavior .
he can bring new characters into the scene , using the <unk> from the table that shows this character .
this is where it &apos;s going to make the sun .
the sun is going on .
now it &apos;s going to be a tractor into the scene .
the orange tree .
good job ! yeah !
by using the <unk> shake and they can put it in front of the characters , he can actually interact with the characters ...
... his own story .
hi !
it &apos;s a story with open , and it can decide how it &apos;s evolved .
moving cat .
now , the last example i have time to show you today is a vocational tool for <unk> that we &apos;ve developed recently and in the <unk> as a sound , like <unk> , bass and drums .
each has four different variations ; you can select what you want to use .
and you can adjust these notes into the sequence that you can ascertain in any other pattern .
and you put them in just by putting a plastic bag on a two-wheeler .
there are effects that you can live live , like reverberation and filters .
you put it with a particular sound and then <unk> it to a particular orientation .
and then even more significant effects like pace and volume that you put on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at .
we begin to <unk> the <unk> in two <unk> , and put them in a series of light , and add a little bit more of the voice .
now i add a bass .
now i &apos;m going to do something else about this .
and now i have the filter with the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can accelerate the entire sequence by putting the pace into one or other direction .
and now i &apos;ve got the filter with the bass ; it &apos;s a little bit more expression .
i can change the sequence as she matured .
i don &apos;t have to plan them in advance , but it can improvise ; they &apos;re <unk> or lower .
and then finally , i can <unk> the entire sequence by looking at the <unk> on the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my excitement is to develop new <unk> that are better to the fit of how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the ways that we work in our lab .
the idea i &apos;d like to give you is that we &apos;re on the cusp of this new generation of <unk> interaction interaction interaction with digital mediums that are going to bring information into our world that are going to be our demands .
thanks very much .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all .
yes , good day .
i &apos;m happy that i &apos;m there .
so , well , what should it be like ?
i have to put a little bit of a time , and it &apos;s been <unk> with the modern molecular biology .
i &apos;m studying molecular biology , and i &apos;ve been looking for a few years with the <unk> , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ve been starting to know because i just wanted to know , and it really wanted to do what i learned in the study of theoretical studies .
so , that was my primary motivation .
so it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter , like that .
now , i think the molecular biology is in general , so in general , the biotechnology , all of what you &apos;re dealing with , synthetic biology and so forth , and so on .
the importance of that is already very important , and much more , much more important is going to be more important in the future .
there &apos;s this kind of controversial things like all of these hundreds of thousands of plants on the <unk> .
now , there are craig venter now in the <unk> , which tries to make <unk> , which is gasoline from algae .
in fact , there are some things that are totally out of the everyday life that most people are not aware of , for example , <unk> that allow us to wash degrees of laundry , are also <unk> enzymes , are also <unk> <unk> . . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt
and the list can continue to continue .
and so , from the interest of interest in this technology , i &apos;m just going to keep banging on that .
so why do they hack ?
most of the people know that from the <unk> .
computers work , and then it &apos;s always going to be like the media , yes , the hacker break somewhere , and then claws data and so on .
so it &apos;s kind of a <unk> , because that &apos;s not what it really started how that actually started how that actually started and what &apos;s going on .
and that &apos;s the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s actually created the internet .
and it &apos;s about starting with a playful , creative , two-dimensional way to solve a problem .
and the problem isn &apos;t just a technical problem , it can also be a social problem , it can also be a social problem , which is just as basic as things , so a question <unk> , a question , and how you can do that , or how do you make that better .
and it was just about the software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole bunch of birds that are doing all kinds of <unk> things .
and so now , as well as it &apos;s going to be in biology , and that &apos;s where i want this metaphor to come back from synthetic biology , that biology is actually a <unk> , because , in fact , that biology is actually a complicated code , which is , it &apos;s not very much like computers because it &apos;s more complicated , because it &apos;s more complicated , and it &apos;s not just <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and you can also program , and you can also do it , and you can also find it , so i found incredibly fascinating , and i was just going to just find a lot deeper , and i just wanted to do a lot deeper .
it actually took us only eight times eight , these networks of networks .
there &apos;s a <unk> dotcom <unk> , which is originally from switzerland , this is with europe and with an cooperation in india , but in fact , there are members or active people all over the world .
that &apos;s a more artistic orientation , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers and working with scientists with scientists working with these technologies and asking questions and the creative issues , and the creative issues , because there &apos;s <unk> and yes , all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s always about trying to find such a coherent way to have access to this as a result of that .
and then there are <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of a network , which is actually more kind of a forum where where you &apos;re going to stop and online .
they &apos;re a little bit of technical lanes , and also a little bit of <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to be asked , yes , <unk> questions .
and based on these networks that have taken the entire popular system , it &apos;s got a series of evidence that i &apos;d like to give quickly .
here in the image on the left you see <unk> , which is a <unk> , so basically a kind of school , such a private school , nonprofit <unk> , where everybody can .
children , old , all kinds of people walking out to just do it , they &apos;ve got a lab , and they look at what can you do when those <unk> hits .
on the left here , there &apos;s a group in indonesia , called <unk> , which is a very long time ago .
longer than these two networks .
now , the way in the artistic aspect of biological materials and , yes , also <unk> , and combine that in quite a <unk> way .
a group of ankara that i &apos;ve been met for a while ago , which is , you know , that &apos;s a <unk> that would stop the public , to explain what you &apos;re learning in school , and you &apos;ve tried to explain how to do it in school , and you &apos;ve tried to explain to people what &apos;s going on .
and i was up in the other image of a lecture in copenhagen in the medical museum in combination with an exhibition .
and that is , yes , that &apos;s mostly a young people , but the only thing that &apos;s really all of the united states , is that fascination at the technology .
and what you can do with it , and you can also respond to the society with the society and ask yourself , so , you know , what do you know what you &apos;re going to do , you &apos;ve got interest in your own way ?
so , <unk> to hack through biology , you need a kind of material .
you need to do , of course , organic materials , and you need tools , and that &apos;s a lab .
or what you normally see under a lab , which is kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , just for <unk> , trained academics , <unk> academics , <unk> academics , or so on .
and our approach was just to say , <unk> , you don &apos;t have to do that .
that &apos;s actually not necessary because each person has actually changed higher , more developed technology than most of the <unk> , that &apos;s really like this .
and with that premise with this premise , then , for instance , brian <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , has taken a <unk> , a <unk> , and , yeah , so <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be bacteria .
so every one that has already been a soup that he has left too long to stand on , even before .
i was trying to put that in my lab , a little bit of time , and then i would put it on ebay and put a little <unk> analysis and do a little <unk> analysis , which is trying to make a <unk> , so it &apos;s going to be a <unk> , so <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s not supposed to be a joke , but .
here in the picture you see here is the lab , in <unk> , so it &apos;s like a <unk> garage with all kinds of <unk> that graduate school , a group in paris , which is what &apos;s going on and quite successful , and quite quite successful things , i want to do a little bit of interesting stuff .
and this is <unk> , which is just mentioned <unk> , this one kind of <unk> in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you can see , it &apos;s relatively pretty <unk> , so that &apos;s really about people that are going to make their own , to large amounts of larger organizations , which stop the more <unk> , even in <unk> shape .
but always , the approach that the approach is that it should just be simple and to be accessible .
now , the first project we did as an international group , when we were aware of ourselves , <unk> , there &apos;s now a real breakthrough here , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re going to know the people who are always chatting and all of us .
and then it came from the <unk> <unk> website of the founder of founder of the founder , and i said , well , we &apos;ve got to meet ourselves , even meet real , and then there &apos;s two events , in london , <unk> ten , and shortly on the <unk> , in san francisco , in san francisco , in san francisco .
and so , because then it &apos;s about , yes , <unk> , who are we , what do we want , what do we want to do , what do we want to say ?
and what are our values and what are our purposes , our foundation ?
and then we have this kind of <unk> adaptation .
so this was quite intuitive , so everyone just has his wishes , his and what it takes to be moved , expressed , then .
and i thought , in my opinion , i think a very good code .
and what we did is , we didn &apos;t design , but that &apos;s really , i think , quite a pretty good thing , people are quite confident about this .
and then we even tried to put it into the academic world , but there it was kind of not going like that .
so , i think we &apos;re actually even more likely to take a step further than the world of world .
yes , what &apos;s the projects that we &apos;re doing now ?
a project i did with the <unk> in switzerland , was that we wanted to make a visual optical trap or optical <unk> .
that &apos;s when you &apos;re focused on a traffic , you can put little particles in the air , or in the liquid fluid , and then in that focus , so that &apos;s a bit like this , just like this , as one of the things like this .
that really works that this is going to work in the academic <unk> , and we &apos;ve been thinking , <unk> , we may have a webcam , and then we &apos;ve taken a webcam , the <unk> , the lens , the <unk> , you have a microscope , it &apos;s about <unk> .
that &apos;s what you see on the bottom .
and then we have a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and then <unk> the laser <unk> and then tries to focus on that camera .
and that hasn &apos;t worked , but we &apos;ve still learned a lot .
so another project that from the french group from paris , that has worked , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and that &apos;s what it was like to be like a <unk> , so <unk> or something like that , so it &apos;s going to be preoccupied with <unk> , his <unk> is sam <unk> .
he was making this one of these helmet there , and in the cooperation with the museum in the museum of the museum .
and there could be the visitor in the room , putting yourself on this chair , that helmet .
then their <unk> measured , and depending on what they thought , or how they thought , it &apos;s then different lights in the room .
which was a pretty crappy project .
there &apos;s another thing that &apos;s going on from the united states , which is also about this <unk> , which is the <unk> , which is the <unk> , complicated word .
so , it &apos;s about copying genes , to vibrant , <unk> , fragments , to breed , so you can light them visible .
so if i look at that , when i climb , you go back , you go out there collecting out there , and then they do that , then they turn that way , and then they can say , <unk> , this hair &apos;s about to that man , like that .
and the machines that make something that are quite expensive that you buy commercially , the cheapest ones go so at <unk> euros .
and that &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , which is also very much .
so that &apos;s just a application of many you can do with it .
and they &apos;ve got two of these two builders and they said , <unk> , which we &apos;re making simpler and cheaper , and then we have the same source of open source , so it &apos;s free out of open hardware , <unk> , that this device is <unk> , and they &apos;re actually the cheapest factors of these kinds of devices in the world .
i think it &apos;s kind of like this $ eight or something .
but in any case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s certainly in a framework where it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
so i think it &apos;s a very ambitious hack .
i started building a project that i had recently started building .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is about something like that , two centimeter or something .
you <unk> <unk> on <unk> , and then you put it into these <unk> , and then i put it on a <unk> , and then i put that on to light , so that &apos;s what it would be like that .
so the device that you see is not working .
but that &apos;s my prototype , but it &apos;s looked like something like this on such a branch , the thing on it , putting electronics on it and using electronics on it , and that was the pressure that was too high , that thing was going to be broken .
and then i took a <unk> and put it in it .
geert chatrou : when you do the full power with water , it &apos;s got pressure pressure , so i think , so 40 to <unk> bar .
and then you can go faster and accelerate those particles , and then you go into the onion .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros or something like this , <unk> like this .
so it &apos;s not the same efficiency , but it &apos;s basically acceptable .
so , in the moment , this is the main symptom of the scene to increase the availability of technology , and the information , and the <unk> , that more people can get involved in that .
because , as you say at the beginning , it &apos;s an extremely important technology , and most people have quite some sense of it , and they don &apos;t have a chance to make it really well .
because , if you read about it , it &apos;s not the same as if you &apos;ve been doing it yourself or seen it .
and i think technology is always important in our modern societies .
and if you want to make meaningful choices in society , you want to be able to get better choices and touch , and then you need access to knowledge and to technology .
and you have to do it and understand it and understand it and understand it .
and then that <unk> then , under the <unk> open source and determined science .
so , you know , as an citizen , as citizens is going to be able to be able to be able to do it with these scientific technologies .
and that &apos;s the <unk> from the <unk> .
these are the people who are at least <unk> on the website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s already a relatively remarkable number of people around the world .
and what &apos;s interesting is that they &apos;re in southeast asia .
that &apos;s because i think there are fewer people doing less than actually exist .
so i know some of you who don &apos;t have trouble .
and these are just the <unk> , the individual people .
and also , with these <unk> , these places together are sitting there .
and that &apos;s very in the beginning .
as i said , it just started .
and <unk> , the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and that &apos;s now a gigantic network of very good , yeah , <unk> , which are all over the world .
and , of course , we &apos;re hoping that we &apos;re going to turn off , and then we &apos;re very good connected to the same as well , so that , as well as more of that , there are more people going to be involved in that .
and i would invite everybody to deal with it every once , and even trying to figure out what &apos;s going on .
now , it &apos;s not that easy , but it &apos;s not impossible if you &apos;ve got enough curiosity and <unk> enough energy , you get too much .
thank you very much for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yes , hi .
how do we work in humans ?
this is a question that motivates me very , as a designer , but also in the <unk> <unk> , and in front of all the things in the field of england .
it &apos;s about how you encounter people in interactive media so that they can use these interactive media and they can use that interactive media and create a more powerful experience .
and i think that the interactive media inside us , cognitive models in us , cognitive models , which is very , very , very , very , very long time , and that we have been able to create the only thing that we can create , through interactive media .
and that &apos;s very amazing because you actually believe that these <unk> , which is that it &apos;s actually going to put that in the future , but in fact , the future is that the future is just about us , in our <unk> roots .
now , what are the <unk> models ?
i wrote four <unk> , and i &apos;d like to explain that for a second .
to <unk> cognitive models , which are the models we have in the pre-industrial times .
in these <unk> models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a real natural relationship to virtuality .
that sounds really , really , unusual .
but i &apos;m going to go back to you , and i &apos;m going to show you through trying to prove that you have a natural relationship to virtuality .
the second aspect is that since these <unk> models , we are able to do very , very heritage , even though we &apos;re using a <unk> language .
and the third area that explains itself from itself .
we all know that the interactive media of definition are <unk> , which is the denial of the linearity , and what &apos;s naturally telling us that we &apos;re feeling the linearity today as normal .
the fourth thing is that the history of us is a place of <unk> .
now , how is it with the virtuality that is actually the most important thing in the world .
i want to show you that to prove that .
how many doors has the house where you live ?
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to answer them not immediately , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen right now .
you go through this house in the spirit of this house , in <unk> it , and look at how many doors are there .
and that &apos;s what you do .
it <unk> reality , which is very without computers .
fantastic , right ?
and we &apos;re going to give us a look at the ted reality of the virtual reality in our <unk> , and we can actually put that all the time .
and this is the fortune that <unk> the virtual reality of the reality , which is what the people had needed in the <unk> times , because they had no need to have anything .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have any mass protection .
the only thing they had was their head .
and in that head , memory of memory .
in that head , knowledge <unk> and through this virtual images , the imagination , they were also preventable .
and so it &apos;s also very strong in us that we can handle the virtuality as well .
the interesting thing about this is when i can make a little trip .
yes , it &apos;s going to be .
the interesting thing about this is that at that time , the human being was <unk> and medium .
now , if you want to think a little bit further .
what are media today ?
you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s been a change .
but i &apos;m going to come to talk to you .
the <unk> of <unk> have been stories since now .
<unk> , priests , so-called <unk> , were this extra barrier to keep knowledge in stories .
and yet today , we &apos;re currently sharing very , very strong stories .
the author of the book of the book , jonathan <unk> , <unk> , we still <unk> every year and a half hours of stories of stories on the side of the <unk> . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that means that for a child that &apos;s going to be the most of the most <unk> of stories of stories of stories of stories of stories in the face of the earth . . . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt
now , let &apos;s think of our love with stories that we &apos;ve been watching as a child on the lap of our parents .
no , no , far missing .
that &apos;s a lot more back , into the cultures of the pre-industrial times .
but for me , in the realm of interactive media , as a particularly impressive , we have seen ourselves in our biological memory , the ability to think .
i brought them an example from the <unk> tribe of <unk> .
and life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , it &apos;s a very ambitious area , and you have to be able to get across island from island to the island to raise food .
and they have done this with so-called <unk> .
you might know , if you &apos;re looking for a little bit , you &apos;re going to be interested in the australian sector .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have <unk> , but they &apos;ve been using that <unk> , or <unk> .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the navigation and the topography of regions could be remembered about songs .
which is the language of the language of <unk> <unk> .
that means you &apos;re talking about sound sounds and rhythm .
and these sound , and this rhythm , have the geology , the topography of a region , and that , of course , is that you could <unk> these songs , and put it back to the left , and go back to the left and go back to the <unk> .
why don &apos;t we sing anymore to get from a to b ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s going on ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be like this <unk> .
we have moved on to the so-called <unk> .
what &apos;s happened is that , and this is the book , and it &apos;s going to be the book .
and that &apos;s what that happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and the <unk> of our individual memories on external media .
the book and the image .
so , unfortunately , we have a little bit of <unk> to <unk> .
terrorism has suddenly gone to us , and it has nothing to do with the reality .
bruce brown , a famous <unk> on the <unk> , is that this mass production , he says the book , and the picture , so on , the internet and so on , and so on what we call mass policies today , the internet and so forth , and so on what we consider as mass media today .
let &apos;s do a little <unk> .
from the <unk> to the mit .
what has focused on our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then the <unk> <unk> of the pre-industrial civilization .
and they &apos;re going to be more and more control over the centuries of the <unk> .
that means instead of watching ourselves , we have infinite , very common , in masses common patterns of memories that we can relate to your personal memories .
we &apos;re not producing anymore .
we have a abstract language .
so , we &apos;re not going to put the things in images anymore , but we <unk> them to our language .
we &apos;ve been used to thinking about things linear .
and we &apos;ve accepted the linearity as a law , and there are only exceptions like this .
what &apos;s left us is the <unk> .
we &apos;re still very , very arrested , very , very arrested .
the question is , what &apos;s now ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had this <unk> , and we &apos;re going to go through that so-called <unk> .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very , very interesting , i know .
but these concepts of the <unk> , which bring us these opportunities back to our capabilities .
it &apos;s about virtuality , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain that for a second .
there are technical concepts like birdsong , which is the augmented reality , which is the augmented reality .
so , if you look at google <unk> for example , so a concept what the virtual world merges to combine with the real world is what &apos;s called the virtual world , which is the virtual world , which is the virtual as a normal natural natural gas , again .
one other example is that so-called virtual reality .
so , of course , this is how crazy that is , of course , in the context of my presentation , because we don &apos;t really move ourselves into <unk> , virtual worlds , just after the model of the <unk> .
and other examples are the <unk> , intelligent systems .
these are spaces that can respond to a man .
all this need the ability to accept , our basic ability to accept virtuality as a real habitat .
i was in the degree , and i hope the video works , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and those two <unk> are also here today .
maybe you &apos;re going to stand up for a long time , so you can look at the ted age with the two of the project on the project .
and this project i brought as an example of how again this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to say to that .
of course , the <unk> of course , and it &apos;s a computer game .
and when i say , you have very likely to imagine that there &apos;s some people in front of you , or that you &apos;re playing with it with the <unk> in your hand .
anyway , they do that in the same way .
this is a game for outside .
and that &apos;s basically what i found out the world , so that i needed the world &apos;s real world .
and this game connects the virtual world , which is the data that we produce , with the real world .
i apologize that i need to be so strong .
you can &apos;t explain that much better , because there &apos;s more than that .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve discovered a city by looking at which places are positive or negative .
and so i get a very different view of the city of a city , which is a very different impression , which i see negative and positive zones of a city and it &apos;s going to be a completely different , virtual map of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we can do now .
oh , what you can see here , sorry , is another little explanation of what you &apos;re going to see .
of course , this virtual world lives in the walls of our cities , it &apos;s clear .
and with a kind of flashlight , we can make these virtual worlds .
so , i &apos;d like to put it to my talk , in the sense that the properties and the skills that we have acquired from the <unk> <unk> , and that we &apos;ve been to have a little bit of <unk> in the mri machine , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to turn into that way , and that we &apos;re going to be able to get into that way of thinking about complex , technological , new products in the future , but actually us back to our roots
thank you .
yes , i &apos;m very fortunate to be with you .
i &apos;ve been asked , if this bag is a <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m going to talk to my instead of speaking .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
i &apos;m also going to try and see what &apos;s inside there .
but still , i &apos;m going to do it even more quickly .
yes , kids are inherently curious , or should be curious , designers .
i &apos;m a creator of the house , which is , of course , with the theme of the curiosity , and how does the curiosity look again , and why are we going to lose curiosity , and we need to new <unk> , and so on .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re looking at next to the actual self as a creator .
when professors are curious , they &apos;re going to be <unk> in this deep n <unk> .
and that &apos;s what i had in the last half of the year .
geert chatrou : the subject of mobile design . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , you &apos;re going to ask yourself , why are all the designers that are so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , and so on .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices here , because things are always going to be more and more natural , more natural , and there you have to look at , and you have to look at what &apos;s really natural for us humans , of course , which is <unk> or intuitive .
and in front of the background , i found myself in the field of rigid design , which is the next generation in the human race , in the relationship of human computers , how our tools or how the computer is governed by the computers to the digital assistant . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so i was trying to do this , when is it , of course , or intuit .
perhaps you might have a view behind that .
why does that happen ?
so when we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s a moment that we &apos;re moving from the third to the fourth <unk> , or <unk> .
so from the modern into the <unk> .
each society is shaped by a <unk> .
at the beginning , the <unk> is through language .
that means that you &apos;ve been found by having a common language , you could communicate with each other , and you could be able to communicate in the same cave , or in other realms , cities developed cities or villages and have created so <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> was the language , something very natural , something very natural .
i mean , you know , you &apos;ve also learned , so not a toddler can talk about nature , but we &apos;re learning it , and naturally , of course .
that was then <unk> by the ancient society and the first form of abstraction .
that was a <unk> , because , of course , the living language started to <unk> in the form of scripture , which is what &apos;s going on and alive , and i &apos;m going to put it into stone , and i <unk> it into stone , and i can do it as well .
so , of course , as i walk up and when i <unk> , it &apos;s of course a completely different coverage than if it &apos;s kind of like a living of life .
but <unk> then , it was <unk> as a <unk> , a <unk> .
then the next generation , where we were actually living today .
that &apos;s just the pressure of pressure , and <unk> <unk> typeface with <unk> and other .
in the same time , it was just a <unk> where <unk> , <unk> and others said , you &apos;re actually holding insane when the people starts to read , and that is , of course , <unk> , and that &apos;s naturally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to come into the next generation , and the exciting thing is , a <unk> is just a few hundred years , and we &apos;re really in this <unk> stage , that we &apos;re going to be doing that .
the confused of course , of course , is because we see on the one hand , the new media , social media , facebook , etc . and so on .
with the complete transparency , which is the new think of thinking about the old thinking , doesn &apos;t tell you that in the corporate sector , there &apos;s no beef anymore or other phenomena , and i want to do that just <unk> , and i want to do that .
and these two worlds are coming in here , new ones and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at this new society , this new society , these <unk> , are very many different mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
but it &apos;s not at the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that the subject of ecology is a global system .
i mean , if i think of it as a local <unk> , the neighbor thinks less litter , then the whole thing doesn &apos;t work .
which is , from local village , a global village has become a global village with the same principles , of course , of course , but also the total transparency .
as you knew in the village , who &apos;s got who , what &apos;s going on with whom and when , this is happening today about these expansion of self through these mobile <unk> .
it &apos;s because we know we know global burden and faster and faster and better .
as it used to be happened in the past , it was going to happen to the village .
so , before the background , i was trying to look at that , which is , what &apos;s natural for us , of course , what do we have <unk> , which is , what do we have <unk> , which is <unk> , so what does the difference look like ?
because usually people can do it , they can &apos;t do it <unk> so that everyone can deal with it .
so you have to be aware of what &apos;s called , and not only it changes that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and when , of course , there &apos;s something like this , and how can i take as a creator on it , and i think , as a matter of fact , the things that make things look like this is a <unk> , so they &apos;re kind of intuitive , because they &apos;re making fun , and they &apos;re just to use .
you &apos;re going to go through , even during the trial , with the subject of perception and the <unk> .
and that is , of course , where you start and look and look and say , okay , now i just look inside the inner self .
and what &apos;s it going to be like in this ?
so how do we work when we <unk> ?
and what does that mean , in fact , how do our channels of perception and how does the cognitive process work ?
because steve jobs has said to me , you &apos;re going to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to look at in detail , if i want to make something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which is what &apos;s called in the core .
and there you see , you know , you &apos;re going to be a our seven senses , most of the time , you know , it &apos;s actually already seven <unk> , and it &apos;s certainly going to be in the next , interesting meaning , and as an expansion of self again .
and to look , how do we process information , how do we use information ?
so to say , what &apos;s the information ?
information is every difference that makes a difference .
many use the word , but it doesn &apos;t really know what it means after all .
but i have to understand in the core , in the creature , when it &apos;s going to information , when you get information from data , from information , from information , so that i know how to make things that i know how to make things more , or of course .
and of course , how does design impact impact on perception .
now , what we &apos;re seeing here is when i design things , i can make them confusing like the right , where i don &apos;t know , which is salt and pepper , or i can sort of make them intuitive by showing things .
so a lot of natural gas , but i look at it directly , where salt and pepper in it .
and when i tell somebody , give me a <unk> or a pepper , it &apos;s going to be the right time , where it is .
and then in the left just access to me , and then i hope that no sugar is in there , that salt salt .
but even our perception itself , how do they tell us .
for instance , this perception in the context .
the right circle looks taller than the small , even though that &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re equally big , and yet , as a result , our perception , depending upon what context we do things .
anyone know what that is ?
<unk> on .
<unk> <unk> should still work .
so it &apos;s already going to be a pair of glasses .
so it &apos;s an n circle .
one second circle starts to be able to relate to them or to associate .
and then when i give you a <unk> <unk> , then we &apos;re not going to look at once a unit , which is circle , circle and , but we &apos;re seeing a unity of unity , we &apos;re not seeing three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle .
it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> , or <unk> , which also affects us in perception .
now , for the designers that have mostly been the first semester , the great <unk> .
<unk> of closeness , <unk> of the continuity and so forth .
in fact , in third , the third time .
but this is a key part of that , if you want to make things as well as you want to make intuitive intuitive .
the next pattern , which is also very interesting .
now , it &apos;s very banal , but it &apos;s really interesting when you &apos;re dealing with it .
so we have the eyes on the front , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the front of the front .
that &apos;s wrong .
you see , from the back to front of the back .
and so , you know , it &apos;s an assumption that you can see something what you recognize , <unk> circle .
now , that means we &apos;re only going to see ourselves , before we see it , again , back to the back of our <unk> , to say , okay , okay , okay , okay , okay .
i &apos;ve got the cognitive cognitive <unk> , you &apos;ve got what you want to see .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to come back .
and then it &apos;s going to leave out , because the back of the bed doesn &apos;t go and say , well , really , look forward , and surely you &apos;re looking at whether what you see , as well , is what you want to see .
and then it &apos;s going to go back , and then it &apos;s actually going to be seen .
so , a very , very <unk> process , how certain things are happening and what these things are going to happen .
i don &apos;t know who &apos;s familiar with this picture .
there &apos;s exactly the same thing i just described .
now we &apos;re trying to see something out of this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who detects what &apos;s detects .
anyone ? anybody ?
a <unk> , right .
once i saw that that there &apos;s a <unk> in there , you know that .
they &apos;re never going to forget , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now look at the <unk> .
and further , you &apos;ll see him always see him .
that means i &apos;ve actually set them out , that they don &apos;t see that they don &apos;t recognize the pattern of magnitude patterns , but i &apos;ve got them <unk> in a very short time , and again , to see this dog in this <unk> image .
and that &apos;s this projection of improvisation , <unk> .
now i know it now , and now i &apos;m going to leave you with that i see the <unk> .
i look at the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes , which then in this , yeah , gray is actually not , but it &apos;s really not here , but here in this <unk> crowd , it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
anyone know what three seconds are ?
it , yes .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s also interesting to know as a designer .
when i know , something takes three seconds , until i kind of get out of the present into the <unk> , then i can also integrate very well <unk> where i &apos;m going to leave him with the three seconds .
it has to be more than present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can do very elegant <unk> for example by the computer when i know this phenomenon .
what do <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , milliseconds .
a very interesting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you fall in love .
this is , apart , if you know that now , look at who you look like for a long time , because i don &apos;t have any <unk> for what &apos;s going to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very interesting phenomenon .
this is the time of most of the perceptions that we have .
that is , this first impression is happening in a remote fast speed , how we perceive things .
and as we look at things that we look at , and how we kind of put ourselves on our environment , so that we can think of that .
and of course , designers don &apos;t just look at the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> , but of course , with the subject of <unk> .
so , how is a human being with certain things .
so there &apos;s kind of <unk> the practical functions , so <unk> things , or <unk> things .
there &apos;s <unk> , where i know exactly where i have to grasp .
but there &apos;s also superficial features , why is there a little bit of a <unk> , where doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s going on , so <unk> sums of money on money , even though it &apos;s not that practical ?
so we &apos;re more on the <unk> , on the yacht club that we are as a creator , of course , as well as designers .
back to my very subject of planetary user interface and the subject of which of course , which is , of course , <unk> .
<unk> always means how can i get quickly to achieve a certain goal , or how one user can do in a particular sense of time , efficient and <unk> a goal .
that &apos;s how it tells you the norm .
how can i make something more extraordinary ?
can i have that directly , or i need to do the n manual or need i need to do it , i need to do it .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
that i &apos;m just going to do it differently and make fun , doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s better <unk> .
you also have to understand .
and then when you look at the software we &apos;ve just seen on it , you &apos;ll also understand why <unk> percent of our current today are little intuitive or not to be able to conceive of all of the parts of our application today , or <unk> <unk> , even though it &apos;s a lot more intuitive than the classic software , even though it &apos;s a lot more intuitive than the classic software .
in fact , intuitive <unk> isn &apos;t just since apple a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , when i just want to make technology technology on people .
why ?
because in fact , in the main way that we &apos;re doing this new kind of <unk> , the natural user interface , for example , five times are at the average of our goal .
you have to imagine that when you do something of classical music , five hours , and with this new kind of natural software is only an hour .
that doesn &apos;t mean that you &apos;ll probably be able to go home for four hours , but your employer , or whatever you &apos;ve got to go through it with the four hours in order .
but i want to tell you that it &apos;s an awful lot of time to do to make certain things .
when we go back into the realm of the software , here &apos;s the first <unk> line that were very abstract , where you took months to deal with these systems .
and then the next thing that came to be done with it , or model model like the software <unk> , have worked , which is , you have a notion of something called the metaphor of a desktop to make the computer usable .
so , no longer zeros and zeros or <unk> codes , it &apos;s a metaphor .
that &apos;s what the whole thing was already doing , but it &apos;s also , of course , a lot better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> operates very much more with behavior .
so , as a result , i think , as a creator , a much more dynamic behavior than what it looks like .
that &apos;s also a paradigm shift .
that i think that this is always <unk> for success , just the <unk> , a <unk> .
and then when i take a step into these forms of user interfaces , where i have by voice , by language , by <unk> , by the gesture , and no longer have to control the things , i &apos;m even more important , and i &apos;m even more important .
but that brings me back to the point , and when things are going to be more intuitive ?
when you &apos;re going to be moving , and then i have to get back to my little friend here , and look , what does that mean by the point of view of the <unk> , when is now actually something like this now ?
and that &apos;s always for us humans , and that &apos;s always a little intuitive when i have to think about it .
so , apparently , he wouldn &apos;t like to think , it &apos;s easy to do it .
the less i think about it , the more intuitive is it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
now , if we look at that we can use existing <unk> from one another , for example , the metaphor , then i can do that as a creator .
that means i can just sort of a intuitive , human <unk> on a software , so that the software can make a lot of desalination brine .
now , of course , the question , of course , is what is the most <unk> planetarium of us , and now i &apos;ve got it .
that &apos;s the so-called <unk> .
this is using each of us and <unk> is a acronym and it stands for hopefully , <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s what makes you all the time , but it &apos;s going to be unconscious , and it &apos;s kind of intuitive or partly .
the model is already <unk> in the womb , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it works in the world at young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used by all of us without realizing that this model is present .
<unk> <unk> is about 50 to <unk> times of us , so in the sleep , you &apos;ve realized that it &apos;s much less frequent than the day .
now , i can now have this mental <unk> chemical chemical , <unk> , <unk> transfer to a <unk> .
and through this kind of transmission , similar to the metaphor of the <unk> , now is not a metaphor of a physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and that &apos;s on a higher basis of the <unk> than the transmission of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> .
and when i look at that now , for example , where i <unk> <unk> , <unk> as a selection , it &apos;s going to be big to me , i can look at it in the details , and yes , i can look at it , or buy it somewhere , or shop , or shop , and so on , and so on , and so on .
then i can translate the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this by a <unk> .
so everyone ate it to be eaten .
mt : now i &apos;m going to be able to do with the object , again , again , <unk> .
i &apos;ll get the whole overview now , can now filter and be able to filter and tell me just all the time with chocolate .
and once upon a time , a interface , which is much more intuitive and much more natural .
because i can reach the things like the bits , it can be <unk> , and they come to me , it &apos;s much more natural than talking about <unk> organized websites , or other mechanisms can sort of make these kinds of things .
compassion is more <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , and with that sentence , i &apos;d like to close a and give the indication , as well as designers have to think differently to get to new solutions , and in that sense , i want to give you right for your attention and i want to give you right for your attention .
i want to give you a very particular aspect of curiosity .
the first thing you &apos;re going to be as a child , as a child , is that you care what <unk> you have , right ? and depending on whether your parents have allowed you to play more or less in your <unk> , the more , you &apos;re going to be able to do it , the more , you know , your curiosity .
and the curiosity doesn &apos;t learn .
all of these are all that are here and curious , in fact , people who have a feature that you can &apos;t learn .
it &apos;s all about this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in quality , in quality .
and there &apos;s a central point in there .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day they give rise to you about two grams phosphorus , and every day they have to phosphorus two gram of phosphorus .
otherwise you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t store energy .
you can &apos;t have bone .
we could only see as a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t actually take phosphorus and fight .
in fact , it &apos;s that we &apos;re concerned with something that &apos;s actually <unk> , but it &apos;s not like that .
because all of us talking about energy , but nobody talks about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much more critical .
we depend on two countries .
we &apos;ve only got phosphorus for two years , and now we have a lot more uranium in the world as much uranium into the environment than it &apos;s used in all the <unk> .
in the last 20 years , <unk> tons of uranium in our fields have been distributed in germany .
and we take it all up .
it &apos;s leukemia with kids .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less harmful .
so , for instance , <unk> the environment , get less cars .
<unk> the environment , make less waste .
environment , the environment , maximum less energy .
but that &apos;s not protection .
that &apos;s like i would say , <unk> your child , it just blow it three times rather than five times .
that &apos;s just a little bit of destruction .
when we think about the <unk> to the <unk> , our entire soil , or later , is a <unk> .
so that &apos;s why we &apos;re thinking about the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the most important thing about this is to look at the ground than we do .
on the ground , over thirty percent of the <unk> is stored .
in the moment , we &apos;re going to build corn corn and lose thousands of tons and 30 pounds per hectare , or on the square meters , as well .
that means we &apos;re going to lose about 4,000 times more than new educated .
and we can of course we can look at the <unk> .
and everything is packaging or the content .
for example , in <unk> , for example , at the <unk> 20 percent of the <unk> is now <unk> .
and because we &apos;re going to grow older , they &apos;re going to be bigger .
that &apos;s kind of all of you in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby needs about six degrees .
we could reduce that about 10 percent , but what does that matter ?
this is balanced in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely trivial .
so the question is , how do we deal with these strategies ?
this is one of the evidence from the fact that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be the pigs of the pigs of the <unk> .
the people on the urine .
yes .
so they can &apos;t be pigs .
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to do with it , isn &apos;t it ?
we think we &apos;re thinking in the <unk> , we &apos;re too many in the world .
and if you give people to exist , if you say that , if you say that that would be better , you &apos;re not going to be there , you &apos;re going to be <unk> and <unk> .
and so somebody like al gore , one of our great heroes , there &apos;s nothing more than stabilize human populations .
in israel , you say , if you give you a human being , you have the earth .
it tells you the more you pass , the better .
yes .
the first question is , are we really too much too much ?
when you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants are about four times more than we humans .
i could also eat termites , but in the united states , no one ever saw , even though they are vegetarians .
that means the ants are much more than we do .
and because they physically work much harder than us , and because they live only three to six months , they &apos;re in their weight , in the energy of something 30 billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too much , we &apos;re too stupid , right ?
and where you see how far we are away from what we really wanted to achieve and how sad we are , how sad we are on the ground , can you see that , for instance , can you be here , for example , for instance , for instance , for example ?
they can only be <unk> if they don &apos;t exist , right ?
the only chance .
have you ever seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one single ?
that means our whole intelligence means that we want dumber as trees , right ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
now , don &apos;t you , right ?
there &apos;s no <unk> trees in trees .
there are still 300,000 trees in the <unk> alone , and there &apos;s still fast trees .
now you &apos;ve heard a little bit of <unk> trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be dumber as trees .
and where you see , even in a little bit like demeter , the <unk> <unk> of agriculture , doesn &apos;t allow us to go back to our own <unk> .
every year we &apos;re going to lose so three million tons of phosphorus that really would have to go in .
and so we &apos;re too many .
on that .
that &apos;s what we call ourselves so guilty on the ground that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you all , that allow your own <unk> .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too many .
it &apos;s safe to be less important to be harmful , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to minimize our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about finding a great footprint , which is useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for economies , but when it comes to the environment , is the highest thing , right ?
<unk> , yeah ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you were going to shoot , you would have emissions .
so you can &apos;t fix that .
we can do it differently .
we can regain our nutrients .
we do in brazil agriculture in where we regain the nutrients .
in fact , in this way , we can <unk> nutrients into agriculture .
we &apos;re doing this in china , for example , where we &apos;re going directly to take the waste out of it .
in china , this is called an <unk> today , sort of , right ?
and in our western world we were always too stupid , our nutrients <unk> .
that means that the whole western <unk> grew up with that the city has been only taken , but the farmers never got anything .
and the cities had to grow more and more , because farmers went to the cities and the cities had to get their nutrients away .
so all of the western empires are always worse , until they don &apos;t have access to infrastructure , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to do <unk> civilization over 4,000 years , because you &apos;ve always been able to swallow the nutrients of nutrients .
even today , if you &apos;re invited to dinner , you &apos;re going to be able to eat for the food that you &apos;re going to stay as long until you get the toilet .
because it &apos;s kind of going to go to go and bring the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them to be invited to dinner , not to the <unk> .
that means you can see on the internet how you can regain the nutrients .
the fact is , if you do that , which is agriculture , that produces biogas , in a hectare of whales , with five people in favelas , so that you can have a farmer about <unk> dollars , and it &apos;s waiting for them to provide chickens and vegetables and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> in favelas are about <unk> percent .
so we don &apos;t need to control people to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
it &apos;s of course , of course , <unk> , but the plants have themselves .
the byproduct is clean water .
and they &apos;re designed to design through the design that a farmer just can just go away .
that means that you go back and forth .
and none of these funds , we &apos;ve been building over <unk> in the last 20 years , none of these assets have ever been <unk> .
they could easily easily put a liter of <unk> <unk> , and then the adoption would be about to be over years .
not instead of .
that means we don &apos;t have to control people &apos;s , very bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need phosphorus .
and by the way , when you want to do what you want to do , you &apos;re looking at , in germany , at best , in germany , in <unk> .
unfortunately , that &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can help the <unk> , you know , a little bit of help .
because the <unk> plant could be the phosphorus of phosphorus .
and it &apos;s got to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it &apos;s really going to happen .
we used to be used in holland for three years .
the flat government has explained , they will be the first country in the world , which is phosphorus .
but we need it .
you know , there are two countries that control almost 70 percent of the arable land around the world .
there &apos;s a bunch of light organs .
these are 65,000 countries that control 40 percent of the arable land .
and the oil will replace us through others .
but the phosphorus isn &apos;t going to replace .
that &apos;s not about making the existing a little less less bad , but it &apos;s about making something right .
and so , in spite of all , what &apos;s the right thing to do .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not about efficiency .
in holland , you can see that , of course , because in holland , the land is built on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife &apos;s sad , if you &apos;ve got it , if you have your <unk> , and you come with fireflies .
it &apos;s very inefficient .
but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
or take a <unk> .
woman in germany eat about six three degrees in their lifetime .
it &apos;s .
this is not exactly correct , because we don &apos;t know how much energy efficient is going to be done .
but a <unk> , even at this lighting , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but it &apos;s very effective , right ?
one of the things that life is beautiful is not efficient .
it &apos;s not scalable , but it &apos;s efficiency .
to ask , what &apos;s the right ?
it &apos;s not going to burn a little bit better to burn and get rid of it , and to lose all the materials for liberals , but first to ask , how do you make <unk> ?
imagine being able to be thrown away .
yes ?
when i put them on the dinner and say , yes , there &apos;s a pill with <unk> and a glass of water .
wonderful , what ?
that &apos;s efficient .
everything that &apos;s beautiful in life is not efficient .
if you fall in love with someone , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not about saving , not to reduce .
all the <unk> .
we &apos;re saying the people , well , yes , you don &apos;t have any of them in the south .
no , the throw is exactly the right thing , right ?
so every place where you go from , you know , you get back to <unk> .
but the wrong things .
when you put the wrong things , you have a <unk> .
in how we think of north .
it &apos;s all footprint .
when you run , yes , any footprint is all the ground .
because the ground is going to die and the wind blows and the water hits the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , everybody &apos;s footprint that the water is staying in meadow .
so , it &apos;s about creating a great footprint that &apos;s going to be a force .
not <unk> .
we say in germany .
yes ?
but when i ask you , how are you going to tell you about your wife ?
what do they say ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , right ?
that &apos;s just the kind of hybrid .
so they don &apos;t save , they avoid .
each waste is <unk> .
and it &apos;s a sense , if you look in italy , like the people in the high wire as it &apos;s got it in a <unk> way .
because you know , that &apos;s a <unk> process .
it &apos;s an awful form of <unk> , right ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the real design , please .
so , for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , which is at room temperature .
they can <unk> where they go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over the place .
and it contains seeds of rare plants , so you can do it through the <unk> of biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less harmful .
so it &apos;s two <unk> .
it &apos;s not all to be <unk> .
it &apos;s a tv machine , or a washing machine that uses them just that they don &apos;t use them .
just the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who have to be like that to be in biological systems .
the things that are only going to be used are in technical systems .
but today , we &apos;re talking only about biological systems .
yes ?
for instance , the <unk> , right ?
it &apos;s not advertising for the company to be <unk> by the company , but for that they &apos;re helping now to help make these products .
because we don &apos;t make the things more free .
yes ?
so when i say to the food and say , this is free of <unk> , then you can &apos;t do that .
no , we &apos;re stuck what &apos;s inside .
good .
so they don &apos;t like <unk> .
not toxic in it .
it &apos;s all in it is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can put on the <unk> on the <unk> , and the light in biological dengue can go , and the light in biological mustard , right ?
it &apos;s all of these things that are out of it .
and when it comes to us , of course , of course , for nike , for nike , for <unk> and <unk> and all the bikes .
and that &apos;s half of all the <unk> around the world that are caused by the textile industry .
and that &apos;s why they help people are asking for the people .
hey , <unk> , do you really want serious ?
because they have now , in fact , have changed the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not sure if you really adore .
so , help me give you a little bit of it .
but it &apos;s .
yes .
that &apos;s what &apos;s been shown .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
we can do things so that when they climb , when they climb , they can put in biological debt .
<unk> <unk> is the same .
there &apos;s this one that &apos;s going to be a direct attack .
this is the first ecological backpack , actually , which is done in the circulation .
so , in any store , you can put things in every store .
when you get to that , right ?
do you remember the growing ?
now , when it &apos;s currently the trash is trash .
all of these things are all over the place , virtually .
in the countries where people get to money .
on the front porch , but even in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastics so that it can go into biological systems , if we change the <unk> , inside that they can just go back to <unk> , and then you can do it with a baby in israel or in tunisia , in the <unk> trees .
yes ?
and if you take these , you <unk> it , sterilized and the powder in order to plant trees .
this is the baby <unk> for all life , from beginning .
so we &apos;re not going to be sisyphus , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s kind of like a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yes , kind of .
yes ?
we can do that .
we can actually reinvent anything .
i &apos;ve got a center of this .
there &apos;s all sorts of people working with , and they all can do it .
there &apos;s extra one of these <unk> , <unk> , where everybody can get involved in .
so no longer saving , sms , avoid , lack , no <unk> , but clever waste .
do you see that ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as a language .
in my talk to my speech , i said that i was as an ecologist <unk> , so in english , in english <unk> .
<unk> are the ceo of the written notes in <unk> music .
that you don &apos;t just have word as a translator for word the text into a different language , but the deeper sense of the words and <unk> have to understand , so that it makes it a meaningful translation , everybody knows it &apos;s a good translation , everybody knows it to do it with <unk> .
from the germans to english , to translation , can you know , you know , when you do it , it &apos;s about poetry , and it &apos;s about poetry , it &apos;s about poetry .
but in fact , it &apos;s for <unk> what we &apos;re doing with our <unk> .
when i was a <unk> , i just first started the written notes .
you &apos;re thinking that the logic gets into the notes of exactly what it has been touched to .
in fact , the notes are very vague and <unk> .
these notes are roughly the same or <unk> , like a verbal verbal , albeit very seemingly <unk> display , description of the landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the smell of the flowers don &apos;t smell , the degrees of <unk> just to mind , not to listen to the <unk> of the <unk> , not to feel like it .
that means that the coffee has to have these <unk> <unk> in a different , which is <unk> , concrete , <unk> <unk> .
so today , i want to show you what i &apos;d like to do , which is <unk> , once again in a verbal language .
so a translation translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i prefer it to do the whole rather to do , because if i had to translate it to the english in english , it would be equivalent to me with translation translation of translation translation .
so , the music that works like this is like the spoken language .
the <unk> notes have the function of the letters of a typeface .
so , it &apos;s not going to be read to read the notes of learning and put them on the piano or the right place on a two-wheeler .
that &apos;s just the letters you &apos;ve learned to paint .
the point of the letters of the letters is only given if you can do the language .
so , for the learning process of music , you need to be at least as long as the spoken word .
and then there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , or you can only understand it , or you can also talk to the <unk> , to the musical speaker .
the work of the <unk> starts very similar to like the one of the <unk> .
now , when you first picked a piece of play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to be <unk> to the latest of the composition of the composition .
you collects information about the piece in the <unk> .
you read in the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether it &apos;s words , thoughts of the composer itself .
you study the works that he did before and after it .
you &apos;re looking at comparison .
the <unk> to write it .
how did he come to see ?
how did his work , like society and politics ?
it &apos;s all interest me .
you &apos;re going to be in that time by looking for for example , for example , for example , and read literature .
over time , as an example , you have a rich knowledge about the composers you &apos;re playing for , and it &apos;s going to be a bit easier to feel it into it and feel .
the one is getting more and more to the friend that you live with together .
his desire to write the piece , is going to be more and more to my personal concerns , to play it .
now , the notes is all about a source of the senses of composers , but only one scaffold , i &apos;m going to put this scaffold to make it again with meaning and to <unk> it .
i would say to my own words , what could be written between this scaffold .
i play <unk> what these notes could have .
now for me and for the composers , and what you could now mean for him today .
each sound , every phrase that gets a sense of it , because i feel it , because it &apos;s actually disconnected from my now to <unk> .
it &apos;s got to be <unk> for me in here , and now i can &apos;t convince my audiences that that &apos;s my cause .
and again , it &apos;s a very happy concert , if i can have the experience , the piece that i &apos;ve worked as long as it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and as you can see a happy new day , even though they &apos;ve been stressing with the same rituals of life , up , <unk> , going to work , as well as the same piece of the same piece again and again .
i &apos;d come back a day , the seasons change , my heart rate goes slower than the morning , in a <unk> , it takes longer that sound is coming back home than home .
i &apos;ll take that breath of the audience , consciously or unconsciously .
all of this impacts me and all that influenced my experience with composition .
it &apos;s also very wonderful when i stand with a <unk> on the stage , and we have the same origins .
then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you bring a new idea into , and it &apos;s going to answer those answers with a response .
it &apos;s exciting because then things that we haven &apos;t explored , and what you can &apos;t compete with .
it makes great fun to do music , and when you have the audience , then , as the audience has communicated to communicate , it &apos;s how to communicate the music alive . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so every concert is another concert .
i &apos;ll never play more like this at that moment .
i can &apos;t play as it as in 20 years .
i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today and i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and i &apos;m going to have a lot more <unk> , to emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have a few <unk> <unk> , but for that , new <unk> .
let me give you a nice example of that .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> in my old teacher , professor <unk> <unk> , a famous <unk> , <unk> and <unk> professor of the <unk> here in <unk> .
unfortunately , i was a lot too young , so that he was already <unk> than i started studying .
but i had the great fortune , it was very early , with the age of 25 years ago , and so i was on my school to my school .
i was 17 when i was on one of his classes once on one of his classes , and played out the last <unk> of the chopin of chopin , a <unk> .
he asked me what &apos;s been the preamble of these <unk> for me .
that &apos;s like a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , expectation .
and he would stand up and he said , like that ?
it &apos;s got to be the <unk> .
because for me , it means memory for me .
he has already been around <unk> .
well , with 17 , you &apos;ve got more dreams , but not a significant memories .
i &apos;m going to play that every couple of years today , and i &apos;ve always felt it , even though it doesn &apos;t change any note .
every time it &apos;s exciting , because , again , i read something new .
an example of this is a very different area , and the <unk> has painted the <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , at <unk> light .
he &apos;s translated out the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as she saw it in that moment .
his personal favorite statistic of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece is comparable .
now i &apos;ve been as a chopin as a chopin with <unk> years ago when he wrote the piece .
he lived only 200 years ago .
and it &apos;s important to me , to look at the notes , even though i &apos;m able to go through it .
in order to keep it straight , it &apos;s directly attributable to the composers .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
most of all , when it &apos;s already died .
now , how do you start to talk to the language of music ?
i said yes , you need about as long as spoken speech .
many times the <unk> is that you learn to read the notes .
you learn to read practically first before you just talk a word .
you learn to find the notes to the notes .
when all of the fingers in time and right as it is in the notes , then notes come out of the sound that sound like music , like music .
when that happens , the student gets the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s not going to be talking about the <unk> .
all right , well , there &apos;s the front of it , that &apos;s a rapid piece of time .
<unk> , slowly .
it &apos;s and <unk> , f and b , et .
you know that most of them here .
but even when you go through those <unk> , it &apos;s still just a little bit technical .
and yet , it &apos;s still not a interpretation .
i wonder .
and i wonder that you &apos;re going to do something quite a bit <unk> wrong .
that is that , to make music on the tool that &apos;s going to be doing your musical and feel already there before .
that &apos;s singing .
a child who hasn &apos;t learned the singing , because it didn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to be done by itself .
that &apos;s like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to have its own experiences and idea of the music to be able to get it over there , so it &apos;s about a tool that &apos;s going to be neat to be wrong with it . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , people who haven &apos;t looked at their own bodies , as it is to form a sound .
put your own breath with your own breath .
and the instrument is , because , is the expansion of our bodies .
our vocal chords to sing , our hands and feet .
so the <unk> in the piano are the sequel of my fingers .
the tune emerges from the <unk> and the rhythm from the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> , right now . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
you don &apos;t need to be able to make music when it gets bored .
it &apos;s not necessary to sing a <unk> or singing .
every one of your music is <unk> , if you &apos;re going to be a music from the outside with music .
sure , there are some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i can &apos;t singing ?
i wonder , can they sing , a because they believe they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they haven &apos;t learned to sing ?
in both of those , it &apos;s not too late to find out if you can &apos;t do it , or learning how to put these little muscles assembling the vocal chords , it &apos;s used in it .
that &apos;s what you can do .
or c , because you &apos;ve got it to you that they &apos;re dodgy .
i wonder how <unk> <unk> was this diagnosis ?
have you already got a <unk> or a <unk> , how do you tell it beautiful ?
or d , you might don &apos;t like music and you want to do it as well as a matter of time .
now , what i did was that , because music is a beautiful , scary thing .
but maybe you can also <unk> them .
well , you can see , all of the cases don &apos;t have to be a <unk> candidate .
but don &apos;t worry , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s good or bad .
i &apos;m sure , but surely i can tell you , whether you like it or not .
because i don &apos;t know , it says , i don &apos;t know if it tastes me , because i can &apos;t cook .
so they &apos;re not going to eat on food , just because they can &apos;t cook .
so they don &apos;t have to put it on classical music because they don &apos;t play an instrument .
listen consciously and tell them if they taste or not .
if the music is too <unk> or too sweet .
tell what you &apos;re feeling .
the time you get a choice , you want to get a little bit more <unk> or taste <unk> differences .
why am i asking for my audience now that it &apos;s going to listen as well ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
it &apos;s a piece of art that you never look at .
the food that was taken by a brand , or a chef , needs to be eaten and not just looked at , and not just looked at .
so you want to hear when a music is played .
it &apos;s not just a nice motivator .
when the adults are actively guiding music , or at least actively hear music , a child , then , is it easy for a <unk> to ask , which color has your flower ?
can you even play me in blue now ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> , instead of a red flower now .
and that sounds very different than before .
that was the very first beginnings of a musical partner .
so the first step is a interpretation .
and what happens when you play a piece of play that initially was written before a hundred or a hundred years ago ?
meanwhile , the instruments have evolved .
there was an instrument in the age of time as an instrument .
it was just not invented .
i think that the stream would have been enthusiastic if he had the most reliable possibility of the modern <unk> .
i can do the <unk> that the bach has had to make on the modern wing , which is what a <unk> <unk> can &apos;t .
it &apos;s about beethoven knows that he heard more than he was already deaf .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play anything , which is the orchestra of the time , as a symbol of it .
that &apos;s why the composers are racing to us <unk> , making the bits again .
they &apos;re going to be audible in the spirit of what they &apos;ve seen in the spirit .
and also , what you &apos;d think about today in the mind .
or what i &apos;d like to do today , because what you might have thought of .
thank you .
do you know what &apos;s envy ?
did you know ?
and how did that feel ?
oops .
i got a friend who &apos;s driving a <unk> .
when i get off , with my little pda , <unk> , and i think , comes out of this feeling .
i believe something through my head .
i said , &quot; <unk> , why do you need to do this great big car ?
that &apos;s going to be the first year half of his value .
and at all , you work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford to do this very sad little car ?
and then immediately , i immediately got a , that &apos;s an unfair .
it &apos;s against justice .
and as i say the word justice , this awkward feeling away .
so , our organism has invented a great way to make these kinds of hate feelings just like envy .
you can also try and do it with words like revenge or something like that .
i want to explain to you with this mechanism today , or something that is probably familiar with you .
the mechanism come out of the lie .
but don &apos;t you think about the lie , as you might have heard , when people say , no one has the intent to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so that he gave them the picture .
in such a lie you see that the liar itself doesn &apos;t think what he says .
it &apos;s very easy to check that it &apos;s very different in meaning .
it only accommodates you and not yourself .
no , the lie that i &apos;m talking about , it &apos;s got to do with it .
you need those lie to get a <unk> to get a millimeter .
they can make them less easy , yes , <unk> or to clean .
they need time .
at that time , an anecdote that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once wrote a woman .
this woman has been changing , the portrait wouldn &apos;t see it .
picasso picasso , just wait for it .
it &apos;s still going to be more similar .
at that point , when you laugh , you realize how important that lie is and how much time you need to experience something , which artists can tell very good .
because artists have a <unk> relationship to lie .
the artist divides to you , and particularly of all this lady , what you don &apos;t see if you just look in the mirror .
the artist divides you in a portrait of what you &apos;re going to be familiar with , if you look at this piece of art .
then this awkward feeling , it might not look like you , and it &apos;s still going to be more like that .
here you have this mechanism that we can do with the lie as a great invention of our <unk> .
and not only in art , even in the <unk> , in the mythology of stories , it appeared again .
you might know this idea of the lady that looked in the mirror in the mirror and asked him , who &apos;s the most beautiful in the entire country ?
one day , this mirror says , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and you also know how much hostility out of this true breakthrough , even the mirror can &apos;t lie , from this real breakthrough .
but we should just be familiar with the fact that you can &apos;t tell a woman that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere in there .
here &apos;s what we need to understand under <unk> <unk> , again , again .
we need these lie , which we &apos;re doing with the deception that we &apos;re doing with the deception , without we can &apos;t be able to bite .
we don &apos;t just have art in art , in the <unk> , but in science , such great lie .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman &apos;s republic of <unk> .
they heard of this book of charles darwin , the origin of the species and the descent of humans .
that the human man should go away from the monkey and , yes , at least one common ancestry between people and apes .
and then she ran into her husband and she said , well , that &apos;s not true , what charles is .
the man &apos;s going to have a human being , or a common ancestry .
no , no , no .
and if it &apos;s true , then we have to prevent people get away from it .
why do we have to stop people from something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live without those <unk> .
because we are dealing with these interaction , this feeling of being great , descent from the highest creatures , not from one such <unk> , from something like this , like an organism , which is still there , a stone , and other things that is <unk> for us .
so , we can &apos;t bear these things .
we &apos;ve got to prevent people get away from things , especially if they are true .
so you can see how slowly these mechanisms are falling apart , and like the traces , it &apos;s going to be a little different than this great image of ourselves , i want to give you another story .
a particularly beautiful story , like me .
my wife has told me .
she came one day from high school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she talked about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to love him because he &apos;s got a propensity to the sincerity .
and she asked him what &apos;s your hobbies ?
and there he said , well , i &apos;m at the fire department .
and because i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yes , you feel it , if you &apos;re <unk> at this point . there &apos;s something wrong with it .
i said to my wife , when a human operates in a moral <unk> , is used to replace it because , we should try to replace it through the <unk> .
once you do that , and then you experience the sentence .
though i &apos;m at the fire department , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
they feel that this is the actual truth behind the <unk> .
this is a little <unk> that doesn &apos;t really care about <unk> .
it &apos;s interested in <unk> .
but there are no sponsors we can change , where you learn how to make fire .
there &apos;s only the basic field , just the firemen .
that &apos;s where he got to be .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t tell your teacher , you &apos;d like you to be quiet somewhere , and you &apos;re excited when the fire gets off .
no , it &apos;s just going to look much better if we show that we &apos;re going to make the risks , the other one , if you put fire on fire .
here you have these little mechanism .
it &apos;s that these <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> already knew that it &apos;s actually related to fire , but that it can &apos;t really tell you that .
here you have this <unk> between the <unk> and the poo , the immediately <unk> , without doing something about it , and the things that you know is that it &apos;s very different , so that they can look much better for you , so that they can be much better for you and other .
so then , these words that we &apos;re also using in the language of the political speech is over and over again .
in fact , we know that something else is .
but we know when we &apos;re presenting that , the social story is very sensitive .
we can &apos;t just do that .
it &apos;s impossible to make things like this in a society that &apos;s supposed to work .
so i &apos;d like to show you what we found in my lab .
in terms of that kind of logic , these intersections , the willingness to be a different reality than the ones that we actually know in the familiar know that it &apos;s valid to spread out .
that &apos;s what i want to give you two , maybe three examples .
the first example is what many of you know , and some of them appreciate , very few of them just don &apos;t need it at all .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so little intellectual , it tells you about leibniz .
it &apos;s something that isn &apos;t consistent from scratch , of physics nature .
and when you have people imagine that they own a soul , or you can say , the belief that you have been touched by the soul to life , then imagine that , as if the soul is such a clever framework about them , not matter , it &apos;s kind of a meat , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , yeah .
and from that soul , you think that it &apos;s kind of in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , it &apos;s called the <unk> , the <unk> , present .
and then when this meteorite hits the people , it &apos;s still with dignity , with spirit , with nature that can only live , with the soul .
and then it can be <unk> .
that &apos;s the idea of how the soul is .
so it &apos;s going to be from the outside to the people .
so we &apos;re supposed to be aware of what &apos;s going to be present to our lives .
and if you have those parameters in front of you , you can understand the logic that we &apos;re seeing with this happiness , by changing our world .
because now you can apply a <unk> .
<unk> , you know , from high school .
now , this is now a <unk> that gives us a logic .
this is the hardest part of my talk .
you need something logic , but the willingness to lie .
so to lie , you can just apply these logic to just wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences .
the first sentence is called <unk> <unk> , there &apos;s no soul .
so the second sentence is , when <unk> &apos;s right , he has no soul .
now there &apos;s a third sentence .
i was particularly struck by this .
a third set , which is immediately presents to people who have a strong sense of soul .
the saying who doesn &apos;t have soul , which is dead , and can &apos;t be anything .
and here you feel it .
this is where this logic is in this , yeah , in this <unk> speech .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sets of sentences that are obvious .
i can say anything .
the logic doesn &apos;t make any statements about reality .
i can say the <unk> is a man .
and if i have right , the <unk> is a man .
if i &apos;m not right , then the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t tell you about what &apos;s going on .
i can say anything .
but the key is , if i have right , it &apos;s true .
so when <unk> says there &apos;s no soul .
second , if he &apos;s right , he doesn &apos;t have soul .
these things are obvious correct .
and now , our conscious mind may be consciousness , and that &apos;s what you can do .
it &apos;s going to be a third sentence , which has nothing to do with the first two sentences and that does that , as if the opposite of the first sentence is already accumulated and <unk> .
because in fact , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it just uses that two sentences are correct , and a third <unk> , which looks like he would have done something to do with it , so we can save our <unk> .
so , we &apos;re going to do it as if it &apos;s impossible without able to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about it .
we can immerse these things on different examples .
in the present , we have a very modern example of the present , again , again , again .
so you have to be able to give you another <unk> subject , a <unk> of philosophy , present .
that &apos;s what we have to do with it that we go back into the <unk> century .
there was a scholars who was called johannes <unk> , and after that , he named <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> that &apos;s made of pure nature .
it hasn &apos;t that soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you place the exact same in the middle of the middle in the middle of the middle of the middle in the middle of the middle of the middle .
because he doesn &apos;t know what kind of haystack should be going to go first .
so , he &apos;s right in the middle .
so the <unk> are exhibited .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s going to be combined with <unk> <unk> . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
there &apos;s nothing happening at all .
so , if you give it a different example , so if you can make a haystack bigger , it doesn &apos;t need any reason , and it doesn &apos;t have to do anything .
it &apos;s going to be the right thought .
so , if you have this idea that you &apos;re somehow driven in nature , it &apos;s going to be kind of a larger amount of money that you &apos;re going to stick a immediately , and you have very much felt that there &apos;s something going to be something like a free will .
and if we are already at the <unk> in the <unk> , i remember the <unk> for brain damage .
there &apos;s a scholars who &apos;s called <unk> <unk> , and by him , sometimes they said , &quot; <unk> <unk> says , there &apos;s no <unk> . &quot;
now , we can now go back to the second sentence , and you can say , if you &apos;ve got <unk> law , it &apos;s not <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely logical and correct .
and what we can now read almost every day in the newspaper , you can find that in this third sentence .
it &apos;s something that looks like that who hasn &apos;t <unk> , can &apos;t be picked up for his actions and statements for responsibility , and it &apos;s so <unk> .
again , you &apos;ve got it again .
in fact , you would have to prove whether it &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do it as if the first sentence of scientists are wrong , as if you need to take the opposite of evidence .
and now you can just do it if you want to do anything if you want to test anything , if you want to test anything , and especially if you want to make people happy , if you want to make it to the lie of the lie .
so , for instance , if you look at one person you can then tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please , don &apos;t you spend the german word for <unk> , which is called <unk> .
that &apos;s not allowed to call them a little bit more political <unk> .
you know , there &apos;s no <unk> .
in addition to that , you &apos;ll be able to have these kinds of resolutions , you know , that you can &apos;t prove to that .
and you have a problem .
because as you are preoccupied with it , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no guarantees , you know , the man &apos;s very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about it because he has misled .
because he led her to a <unk> , where he doesn &apos;t move himself up .
because in fact , that person isn &apos;t really interested in it .
it &apos;s just interested in itself , in addition to having to prove to prove that there &apos;s <unk> .
so , in the way of the shift of <unk> , it &apos;s the brilliance of the lie .
and once again , if you have a chance to feel these <unk> , to other people , they do it because they &apos;re going to make other happy if you don &apos;t remember them .
i thank you for your attention .
yes , good day .
i &apos;m allowed to tell you , i &apos;m allowed to tell you if i &apos;m going to mention it .
she &apos;s one of the <unk> here from this great event , and he asked me if i &apos;d give you a lecture here and my idea .
i must say , you know , you &apos;ve got it , it &apos;s got me hard to talk about my idea .
and i might think , perhaps my favorite idea , i &apos;m going to try to imagine that i &apos;m trying to introduce you to .
but , of course , the sum is very , very many ideas .
i &apos;m probably going to be the two nice girls still there , i &apos;m probably going to be the generation that &apos;s picked up for this bad image of image , because i &apos;ve already started studying , in <unk> , engineering , in <unk> , engineering .
and i got to berlin years after berlin , because i wanted to make renewable energy , and that &apos;s not going to be in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
they all <unk> at all , even the <unk> was called <unk> .
the <unk> today is <unk> .
because a good engineer has either created great cars or <unk> .
but as a matter of fact , like the n of a hundred watt out of the square square meter , it was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a magic <unk> .
i &apos;m grateful grateful that he &apos;s got the word again , because after the <unk> , you don &apos;t have to use the word again , because it &apos;s not going to be able to use the word anymore , because it &apos;s all bad .
but it didn &apos;t exist in the <unk> years .
so it was just that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> , where you <unk> evil .
so , in the <unk> , but it was called <unk> and it was made wind and solar power , and i started in the middle of the berlin .
and yes , a lot of what &apos;s been said to me , because many , many beautiful expressions were the ones that i &apos;ve also explored .
i worked out 11 years in the collective , which was <unk> .
we were twenty people .
when a no one said , it was a <unk> , which is a completely <unk> . i &apos;ve got a hard time for 10 years , if i might really work my great <unk> , because all the colleagues of my father used to have <unk> , you &apos;ve got the money to the window of your father .
it deals with a lot .
and that was really , very <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be in such a sort of thing , and it &apos;s going to be a picture of the way that i asked myself after 10 years , a thousand <unk> , and <unk> in the collective , of course , is that it should be like this .
and then i got it to <unk> <unk> , and then we got together with friends with friends i had become <unk> by the company , which was combined with the <unk> <unk> of one of the world &apos;s largest microfinance .
a <unk> , but also , we &apos;ve got the problem of a growing company , and we have <unk> , a small group , decided that we start small , and we go back to the next subject of the future , and that means that it &apos;s going back to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be like , it &apos;s going to be a little bit , and that &apos;s all that &apos;s going to be wrong with that .
and i brought you a project i &apos;d like to introduce you to you now .
and the title of the trial was , as you go to a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started asking with a relatively <unk> story of questions , where if you could make a memory today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the island .
yes , these are the data .
there &apos;s four thousand people living .
they have a huge amount of energy today by 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t you have anymore ?
that &apos;s just technological technological .
when you get more <unk> each other , the system starts to fail .
i &apos;m always telling the politicians when it comes into <unk> our facility .
they always say why ?
we already have 20 percent in germany .
can &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we have seven percent in europe , and our web is the european european .
if we had in europe , we &apos;d have had the same problems that people have on this island .
the question was , you know , it was <unk> , have the first contacts with the island of the island with the island of the island .
how big a battery would have to be like this , so you could have an island on 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 , maybe even risk percent renewable .
and yeah , i &apos;ll go back again .
the conventional system looks like this all over the world .
by the time , a hundred or a hundred or a hundred , electric performance on <unk> <unk> in the world .
that &apos;s the equivalent of a hundred milligrams , because it &apos;s very quickly everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , which is happening , with diesel , because you don &apos;t need any permission .
that &apos;s very quick .
you put it in that box .
and then it looks like this .
it &apos;s always taken three of the <unk> , two will always waited .
yes , you see that there &apos;s the bottom up there .
we &apos;ve also got very detailed data .
and the <unk> or whatever it is , or whatever it is , is usually a system , which is just in small amounts here in small quantities here .
now , our goal was just to say , okay .
it &apos;s called the <unk> , and the wind , sun is the burden that they can map the larger scale .
and if you want to go across 20 , 30 percent of renewables per year , you don &apos;t want the performance at the moment , you have to turn off the brick .
that is , at the moment , you have to worry that the renewables can somehow take the entire web .
you can only of course , if you &apos;re going to be able to put in some way here in any way .
it hasn &apos;t done any in the world .
that &apos;s in the little style , so you can also use your <unk> on a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you do in <unk> ?
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
but if you want to look at several of these <unk> <unk> , and you want to build a net , it &apos;s going to be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go back to 60 percent renewable renewable , and then there &apos;s this rest , the last 10 , 20 percent renewable renewable , which is going to be very , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work that you &apos;re going to work that out of batteries .
it &apos;s going to be a energy efficient , which then , hydrogen , methane , methane , power to gas to gas , or <unk> , that will be then .
they &apos;re going to have to go to a <unk> , and it &apos;s not just <unk> , not just <unk> .
we just wanted to know , what about a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far are you going to do it ?
and then they took a whole bunch of simulations .
and the wind and the sun and the sun , and the whole <unk> , and came to the conclusion , a very interesting outcome that you have to do to the conventional system , which is about 20 cents per attack , about 50 cents per attack , about 50 cents per attack .
that was the first time six years ago .
and then we said , okay , okay .
it &apos;s great , we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , if the average likelihood of five percent per year .
and then we started to negotiate with the <unk> .
what should they do ?
do investors with investors , i &apos;ve been looking for new <unk> .
we had only five people at the time to build one around society .
and here &apos;s the picture .
the brown is kind of the conventional system , the green system is our system .
that our system also has a <unk> , it &apos;s because we &apos;re going to do 60 percent of it with diesel , and we don &apos;t have a <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> , which is what &apos;s going on on the island , has meant that we find great .
do we want to support them , but we don &apos;t believe you can solve the technical problem .
and so we have decided to build a hall where we can sort of map the electrical sparks of the island of the island of the island of the island of the island .
that means we &apos;ve come to find the greatest battery of the world .
here she is .
it &apos;s all out of asia , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , it &apos;s been <unk> in the &apos; 70s in bbc , today , and it &apos;s been developed by the japanese .
you can see , it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it &apos;s got a high performance , and you can put that performance on this performance , and that &apos;s the battery that we kind of <unk> <unk> .
and then they set up .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size , as it is there in the hall , to actually put the entire dynamic behavior of this web , so in the hall , it &apos;s now going to be the magic , there &apos;s the <unk> , here &apos;s the great battery , here &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s the whole wall that we &apos;re designing the net .
this is where we can capture the whole thing , the <unk> of cables , to sort of put the <unk> on the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> onto the net .
this is what we see here , again , again , again , again , again , single <unk> .
and what we did was , since <unk> , the hall was done until today , until today , all the things that &apos;s going on between the single system of electronics on electronics , in software , we &apos;ve done .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company , which is just between the subject and the topic of web and everything in between .
you have to communicate to the battery , you have to communicate to the web , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the beautiful thing is , you know , you can basically take this island today in this island today of problems that we &apos;re going to get when we want to increase our share of renewables .
so this whole debate , how is it going to be the moment and the <unk> , how do you go to the island of the island , for example , for instance , for instance , <unk> , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> is going to be <unk> .
so <unk> , an <unk> everywhere .
we can start in the island of starting to integrate <unk> , <unk> , you can manage the burden of burden .
that means if you &apos;re at risk percent renewable , you can &apos;t do that without memory .
you can go through <unk> , you can &apos;t get through the bed nets , yeah , that &apos;s not what you should be doing in any case , but you &apos;re never going to be able to reset on memory .
and that &apos;s the very n of the message .
that &apos;s why a lot of people are coming in and looking at it , because you can see what &apos;s the problems that you get .
when we shut down the diesel , you can &apos;t have that spinning orientation that causes a certain emotion in the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically just a traditional rotating <unk> , where all the wave around the wave are all about europe .
we look into this web , we see the 50 hertz , and if there &apos;s a <unk> valley of nine hertz , we &apos;re going to start a few <unk> steam , then again , a little bit of <unk> steam , then we get back up again .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , that &apos;s an awful bonus .
when you put that somewhere , it takes a long time .
the <unk> delta has at least 10 seconds to keep the net stable .
and in time , you can respond again .
if you don &apos;t have that , you have to replace that spinning , you have to replace it with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can do it with this big battery two milliseconds .
you can see that there are enormous amounts of information there .
and the message is , we need to get rid of those rotating crowds , if we kind of put our goals , 20 , 20 percent , 20 , 30 percent and so on , if we want to reach that at all , if we want to reach that at all .
then we have to put our <unk> capacity on the net .
it &apos;s called the power just to keep the power power to keep the frequency .
yes , that &apos;s a <unk> right now , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not going to be .
and we &apos;re just trying to tell you that you can put the capacity , the <unk> capacity , if you can use electrochemical memory to the net .
now , there &apos;s also a whole lot of studies .
and to that purpose , people always look and look at our <unk> on the ground , sort of , our <unk> .
and yes , the discussion is all about how far you can see a piece of the future there .
and many discussions that i had in the last six years were similar to the debate that i had in the last 30 years .
don &apos;t be done , <unk> , we &apos;ve been packing all evil , never going to be able to get rid of it .
we have here today in pune today in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out that we &apos;re going to have the same capacity in the next 30 years in the next 30 years , all over the world .
simple , it &apos;s going to come .
there &apos;s going to be a whole lot of <unk> and arguments .
the beautiful thing is , i &apos;ve been in the last two years , that scientists have been asking to my side .
we &apos;ve got over 10 million <unk> , even though we have a <unk> <unk> now to <unk> the german web now .
that &apos;s going to happen in the next april of april .
so , from that , you &apos;re going to notice that there &apos;s a change there , and it &apos;s only going to go from those <unk> , to the idea , a hundred percent renewable renewable .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable supply , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
it &apos;s always been tried to do in discussion , these <unk> , which are doing a little net , which has nothing to do with our <unk> .
but the question is , though , if you &apos;re totally making yourself independent from any fossil or <unk> <unk> , which is going to be <unk> anywhere in the world and you &apos;re going to be <unk> to you , you &apos;re an island .
they &apos;re only going to use it , which is in sun and wind , where they live .
and that &apos;s a little bit of our vision of an <unk> energy efficient , and i &apos;m grateful that they said they &apos;re used to use solar power .
and that &apos;s what we do , and we &apos;re going to come back , even the talk of galileo &apos;s disease , that you can be an experiment and use sunlight , here &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i just want to encourage you , in the sense that you can be a little crazy and also a vision .
and you really have to get stuck with it , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
when steve lopez , the ceo of the los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a african-american , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , who was on a violin , who had only two strings .
many of you will know the story , because from <unk> articles on this later , a book , which was naturally <unk> , with robert <unk> <unk> as steve lopez and jamie <unk> as a nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , which was studied at the <unk> <unk> , and his father career by his <unk> schizophrenia .
nathaniel left juilliard , a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a homeless statue on the streets of los angeles in the center of los angeles .
i recommend all of you to read <unk> book or look at the film , so you can &apos;t just understand the wonderful connectedness that is created between these two men , but how the music was able to make these connections , and how it was ultimately allowed to make the instrument , if that location is allowed to get the <unk> , <unk> away from the street .
i met mr. <unk> in 2008 , two years ago in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just heard a demo of beethoven &apos;s first <unk> and fourth symphony , and he came across the stage to imagine .
he was talking to a very <unk> and <unk> sound about yo-yo , and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers would never be able to put it into baseball world , and all of this because of the first violin in the last sentence in the last sentence of beethoven &apos;s war set of beethoven &apos;s war set .
and we came to talk about music . and a few days later , i got an email , in which it said that nathaniel to me .
i have to mention that nathaniel a medical treatment , because it was already being treated with electricity and with <unk> and <unk> , a trauma that has haunted his entire life . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
as a result , it &apos;s especially vulnerable to these schizophrenic phases , which are sometimes so bad , and he disappears so bad , in the streets of <unk> <unk> , always this horror and the <unk> of his own skin .
and in fact , in a <unk> <unk> , nathaniel when we started with our first offspring in the walt disney <unk> hall . he had this <unk> <unk> in his eyes and it was completely lost .
he talked about invisible bikes and smoke and about how someone wanted to poison him in your sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could lose him that he could put into one of his states , and i could destroy him to the violin , when i started thinking about thinking and <unk> and other exciting forms of the <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of beethoven <unk> .
and while i was playing , it occurred to me that in <unk> &apos;s eyes , a complete transformation .
it was like , under the impact of a invisible soul , a chemical reaction , whose catalyst was my game .
<unk> <unk> <unk> grew up in understanding , into a calm curiosity and grace .
and as a miracle , he took his violin , and he started to play some snippets from <unk> <unk> and then asked me to end up : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started talking about music , from bach about beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized that he wasn &apos;t just answering a knowledge of music about music , but it was also dealing with her a narrow personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion and a understanding that i know only about my colleague in the <unk> of los angeles .
when he was playing music and talking about music , it was like this <unk> , confused man , who was still in the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
music is medicine . music is changing .
in nathaniel means , music means more expensive health .
because the music allows it to help his thoughts and delusions with his imagination and creativity into something real .
and that &apos;s how he <unk> his <unk> .
i understood that this is the nature of art .
and that &apos;s why we make music , so that we can do something that happens in all of us , deep inside all of us , our feelings , through our artistic lens through our creativity to reality .
and the reality of the speech reaches us all , and moves , inspired and united .
what nathaniel ruins , so it took him back into a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music took him back into a family of musicians that recognized his talent and <unk> him .
and i &apos;m going to talk about nathaniel music , no matter whether in the walt disney <unk> reverberation or in <unk> row , because he reminds me why i got musicians .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : thank you very much . thank you .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play something that i &apos;ve got <unk> <unk>
i hope you &apos;ll forgive me .
so i &apos;ve learned a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two .
this first one , that was more like a passionate affair .
it was a nice fish , <unk> , good consistency , <unk> , a <unk> on the menu .
what a fish .
and better , he was born in <unk> after the supposedly highest standards of sustainability .
so you could feel like you &apos;re going to be able to sell him .
i had a relationship with this beauty for several months .
and one day , the head of the company , and asked if i could go to a session for the sustainability of the farm .
&quot; i said , &quot; of course , i said .
so , here was a company that was trying to figure out which was this incredible problem for our chefs , how do we retain fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have charted the ocean as we have predicted .
it &apos;s hard to conceive of destruction .
ninety percent of the great fish that we love , the tunas , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re collapsed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so it &apos;s probably going to be <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , most of them anyway , and they &apos;re inefficient , we take tuna . a big disadvantage .
it &apos;s got a <unk> of 15 to one .
that means 15 pounds are required for you to get a pounds of dopamine .
not very sustainable .
nor do not very good .
so , here was a company that tries to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
in front of the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s call him .
&quot; surrender , &quot; i said , &quot; just to have the facts , you &apos;re famous for doing so far out in the sea , that you don &apos;t recognize the environment . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so close to the waste of our fish , not concentrated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world .
this <unk> from <unk> to 1 , he said .
&quot; the best in industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one , what are you going to do ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins . &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and that evening i was on bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , just before the event .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you want to do , for example , sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know that . he &apos;s going to give it .
now , i <unk> with a few people in the company . nobody could give me a clean answer , until i finally got to biologists .
let &apos;s call him also .
&quot; surrender , &quot; i said , &quot; what are the day-to-day proteins ? &quot;
now , he mentioned a few algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , hundreds of , skin , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
perhaps , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don &apos;t you know what &apos;s sustainable about eating chicken on fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause in the olympics , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i <unk> myself from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m even .
no , i was actually <unk> by this fish because , i swear to god , the fish after chicken , the fish after chicken .
this is a second fish , which is a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way that you learn , you learn to know your fish more , you love fish more .
i ate him first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> reporter had been talking about for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> to us .
he came to the table with a bright , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
stop twice .
in fact , he was still delicious .
can you leave a fish as well after it &apos;s been <unk> ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . actually , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he didn &apos;t eat the fish , and it &apos;s not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist at <unk> la <unk> .
this is a casino in the <unk> corner .
it &apos;s near the <unk> of the stream .
up to the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> <unk> on what was basically wetlands in wetlands .
they did this by looking at the country .
they built this complicated episode of channels , and it <unk> water from the land and out into the river .
now , they couldn &apos;t make that that business , not economically .
and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds in the world , which are many birds .
and so , in 1982 , a spanish company bought the country .
what did you do ?
they &apos;ve vice the flow of the water .
they literally <unk> the levers .
so instead of the water , they used the canals to deflect the water again .
they <unk> the canals .
they created a 11,000 acres of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , <unk> -- and his company <unk> the ecological demolition entirely vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like that .
look at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are <unk> channels and that <unk> , lush march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time ago .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin and a piece of &quot; a crocodile for kiss . &quot;
okay ? so there we were , and we got ourselves through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees , and <unk> <unk> into trouble .
this is how he picks up a rare <unk> .
now , he mentioned the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here &apos;s a pattern of bundle that reminds him to the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that the most significant part of his career has spent in africa in africa .
i asked him how to become a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then it &apos;s going to go through more pockets of rare birds and algae and curious <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , in that way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of fish that i had on the <unk> .
so i cut him . i said , &quot; <unk> , how do you get your fish so good ? &quot;
he showed up on the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do you eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
now , he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a physical system , that the fish eat what they would eat in the wild .
the new biomass , the phytoplankton , the zoo , that &apos;s what the fish run out .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
there &apos;s no food .
so from a farm that doesn &apos;t get their animals ?
on the day , i finished on this site with <unk> <unk> , and i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so naturally , &quot; how any farm i &apos;ve ever had , &quot; how do you succeed ? &quot;
in the moment , it was like a spanish would have a <unk> .
and we moved around the corner and we offered the most incredible sight , thousands and hundreds of south africa , a literally pinker rug as far as the eye .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
she &apos;s exaggerating . &quot;
<unk> ? i was totally confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , aren &apos;t you going to do your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we &apos;re losing 20 percent of our fish and <unk> to the birds .
now , last year , on this site , there were more than 250 different ways .
it &apos;s become the biggest one , and one of the most important private <unk> in europe .
i said , &quot; <unk> , isn &apos;t the last thing that you want to have on a <unk> ? &quot;
he shook his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not intense .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the more step the belly is better than the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s rerun that . a farm that &apos;s not running their animals , and a farm that measures their success in the health of their predators . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , by the way , these <unk> are not even going to be there .
they breed in a city of a city , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly 5,000 miles to the farm .
and every night they fly to be 5,000 miles .
they &apos;re doing that because they can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> .
seriously .
i had a kind of a journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> , fly you 5,000 miles to the farm , and fly you 5,000 miles back to the night ?
do you do that for the kids ? &quot;
he looked at me as though i &apos;d just quoted a song of whitney houston .
he said , &quot; no . you do that because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like it . i don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i almost never deal with it .
and yet , when i tried to put her in this restaurant in <unk> , she didn &apos;t have to go through <unk> .
they liked sweet and as if you would take a chunk of the ocean .
i mentioned that for <unk> , and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; skin seems like a sponge .
it &apos;s the last persistence before something into the body .
it &apos;s evolved in evolution for evolution in evolution . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no <unk> . &quot;
okay . there &apos;s a farm that &apos;s not running their fish , a farm that measures their success measures on the success of their predators , in most of their lives . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp;
and then i realized when he said , a farm that doesn &apos;t have disembodied , it <unk> it , because the water emitted through this farm comes out of the stream .
it &apos;s a river that takes all of these things to do with all the rivers today , to lead them with , chemical pollutants , controlled by <unk> .
and when it was running through the system , and this is the water on the ground , and the water is clean , as it is <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water .
so not just a farm that doesn &apos;t just pass their animals , not only a farm that affects their success on the health of their predators , but a farm that &apos;s literally a <unk> , and not only for those fish , but for you and me .
because when the water hits , it &apos;s in the atlantic ocean .
a drop in the ocean , i know it , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love , as romantic as it &apos;s always , is also <unk> .
you could say that you &apos;re a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , from one , in the food , in fact , in the food industry .
but for a lot of people , it &apos;s a little too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re buttermilk .
we love cuttlefish . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about regional food . we feed feed organic .
and if you claim that these are the things that are the future good food , somebody says , &quot; hey guys , i love <unk> <unk> , but how will you feed the world ?
how will you feed the world ? &quot;
should i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like that question .
no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than feed .
we &apos;re going to starve a billion people today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities in distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i don &apos;t like that question because you have the logic of our <unk> last 50 years .
as a result of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the ground , chicken on fish , and all the time , the agribusiness just said , &quot; if we feed more people , how terrible can it be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the <unk> . it was the business of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , an <unk> in <unk> , a frequency generator , which is rapidly enabling <unk> capital , which is taking exactly that production .
that &apos;s not a craft , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
now , our <unk> is threatened today , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
it &apos;s not by the latest culprits and <unk> , but by fertile land , not by pumps , but by fresh water , not by sweating , not by <unk> , and not by <unk> and nets , but by fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
so let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or how do we create conditions that enable each community to feed themselves ?
and to do that , don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
wild , chemistry and machines are in it , and it never made something really good to eat .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that , in two billion years , <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
things that are not the worlds for themselves , <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> grow , rather than just intense , farmers that are not only disabled , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones who are experts who are also experts for taste .
and if i really am honest , you &apos;re a better chef than i will ever be .
you know , that &apos;s right , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it will be delicious .
thank you .
if i want to tell you one thing today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data that we consume is greater than the sum of their parts and instead of thinking about it , i want you to think about how we can use information about how we can use information , and we see so trends that are not going to be visible .
so , what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> after age .
the program i used here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter after a certain incident , we say crashes .
and immediately i see another pattern that makes it happen .
and that &apos;s because , in the <unk> , there &apos;s the people who are at the first place , and they &apos;re at the <unk> .
we can take a step further and look at the data and see that <unk> and cancer are suspects the usual , but not for everybody .
now , if we &apos;re now going to go on and look after age , we &apos;re going to see 40 years or younger , we &apos;re going to see that accidents are even the key to people .
and if you look at that , it &apos;s particularly true in men .
so you realize that this is the view of information and data in this way of swimming into a lively <unk> .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not for content itself ?
now , what we &apos;re now here are the <unk> of every single &quot; ritual <unk> , &quot; which were ever been released .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can test it for my talk in your closet .
you can put it in a decade or a decade .
they can be in a particular year .
you can jump directly into a particular edition .
now , when i look here , i look at the athletes that appear in that copy and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a lance armstrong fan , so i click on that , all expenses show me in which lance armstrong is going to be mentioned .
now , if i want to get a snapshot overview , i might think , &quot; ok , what if i look at the subject of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to step back , and look at the view .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea that if you merge this kind of information , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t look or <unk> , you don &apos;t just look at it .
you make something that &apos;s actually slightly different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
i &apos;d like to take this idea a little bit further with about what &apos;s a little crazy .
what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve taken every single <unk> , and put them on a little summary .
the summary contains a quick dashboard and a symbol of the area where she comes from .
i &apos;m just showing the top 500 of the world &apos;s most <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can do a lot of things .
immediately we get a glimpse of the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to vote the issue of government .
now , after i chose &apos; government , i realized that the <unk> , which are most of the time , &quot; people &apos;s year &quot; to be &quot; of the year . &quot;
this is really important because this is a realization that doesn &apos;t exist in a single soul .
it &apos;s only when you step back and look at the whole thing .
so , based on a particular summaries of these summaries , i can then go back into the subject of time , &quot; people &apos;s year , &quot; and all together see all together .
now , when i look at all these individuals , i realize that the majority are <unk> . some come from science . some , even less , come out of the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes out of the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is a ted prize winner .
so we can jump and look at all the ted prize winners .
you can see , we &apos;re going to see the first time , as though it &apos;s really a web , not only from side to page , but much more abstract .
and so i &apos;d like to show you what a little surprise could be .
i &apos;m just showing you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it browser ; it really isn &apos;t a browser , but you can look at websites -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back and go straight into a specific <unk> .
that &apos;s why , because , you know , because you &apos;re just looking at the data of websites in this way , all the way back in the same way that you can look at the same in the same way .
so i can look at my new height in a particular moment .
this is the state of all the demonstration i &apos;ve been thinking about .
and i can kind of like anything that i &apos;ve been looking at today , again .
and when i take a step back and look at everything , i can actually rethink my new trajectory , perhaps after my <unk> . here i was looking for <unk> , here in <unk> , here to live here to live here to live here to live here .
and from here , i can go into the side , and it &apos;s going to be again .
it &apos;s a metaphor that &apos;s used over and over again , and every time it makes the big bang bigger than the sum of <unk> .
right now , in the world , we think that data is a curse .
we &apos;re talking about the curse &apos; club .
we &apos;re talking about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could turn that situation and put the internet on your head , so that we would always be able to go from one to the other , from many of many things to many things , and see patterns that would be otherwise ?
if we can do that , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , maybe a new source of information .
and instead of moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know knowledge , we can maybe even move away from it .
so i hear that , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my school , i went to school with the bus to school every day every day .
and my nose always kept in a book , a <unk> that my thoughts in other worlds , and in <unk> ways , my deep <unk> , <unk> curiosity .
and that curiosity also showed me that when i was not in the school , when i was in high school , and <unk> and <unk> , frogs and snakes and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , all over the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it &apos;s always about trying to understand the world and understand the limitations of the potential .
and my love to science fiction appeared in my environment , because then , in the late &apos; 60s , we flew to the moon and we <unk> the deep sea .
netflix cousteau came into our living rooms with his fascinating screw that we could have , and a world full of miracles that we never imagined before .
now , that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to do with the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and because there &apos;s no video games there with <unk> movies , the whole <unk> in the media landscape , i had to create the pictures in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to do at that time , when we read a book when we read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and projected them onto the canvas in our heads .
and my response to that was that drawing and painting from extraterrestrial , extraterrestrial worlds , robots , <unk> and all that .
in the <unk> , i was going to get through teachers all the time , like me , in the textbook , <unk> .
the creativity had to be kind of out .
and something interesting happened . what excites me about jacques <unk> display , was the idea of a completely unknown world here on our planet .
sure , i would never meet an alien world with a spaceship . that seemed quite unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i could actually enter , here on the ground , and it was just as fascinating and exotic like all that i had always imagined when i read these books .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i decided to be diver .
the only problem was that i was living in a small village in canada , 200 miles away from the nearest ocean .
now , i didn &apos;t let myself exist .
i <unk> my father until he finally got a <unk> in buffalo , new york city , on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i took my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the middle of the <unk> in the middle of buffalo , new york .
the ocean , but , a real ocean , i got to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since then , in the 40 years , i spent about three hours underwater underwater . 500 hours of it .
and i &apos;ve learned that the world of the deep sea , even in the most remote oceans of life is so rich in <unk> life , how we really can imagine it .
nature knows no boundaries , as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
until today , i feel deepest awe for what i see in my next orientation .
and my love to the ocean is holding the same intensity as it is and ever .
when i was an adult , when i was an adult , it was the filmmaking .
that seemed the best possibility , my inner thigh , to tell stories , with my need to unite images .
as a child , i drew the bed of constantly and so forth .
so movies of the way , images and stories , that fit together .
and of course , the stories that i took off , from the <unk> , &quot; terminator , &quot; &quot; aliens &quot; and &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i could put my predilection for the <unk> and the <unk> with the filmmaking .
so , in fact , the two of these two loves .
something interesting happened to &quot; <unk> , &quot; to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> -- we got to <unk> animation , <unk> , back .
the first thing that came out was the first <unk> ever thought to be able to see in a film .
now , the film doesn &apos;t bring money , which is the only thing that he &apos;d just been trying to do , but i realized something amazing : the audience all over the world was <unk> from the magic that &apos;s coming out of it .
according to arthur <unk> &apos;s law , the law are <unk> technology and magic .
so they saw something magical .
and that &apos;s what i found was a complete deal .
and i thought to myself , &quot; wow , that &apos;s really going to be involved in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went to &quot; terminator 2 , &quot; my next film , even more quickly .
so with <unk> , we created the guys out there with liquid metal . the success was very much about how this effect would be .
and it worked . again , we created something magical , and the impact in the audience was the same , but we &apos;ve had a little bit of money on the movie a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , it was a whole new world , a whole new world of creativity for <unk> .
so , i started a company , with my good friend stan winston , who was at the time of <unk> and <unk> . she called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
and the basic idea of this company was that the stage analog processes using visual printers , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> with digital <unk> .
and then we did that , and that gave us so much for us to give us a muslim .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we realized that we were in <unk> and <unk> -- which we actually had created the company -- to slow down .
i had written this piece of &quot; avatar &quot; that would be <unk> the price of visual effects and <unk> effects in whole new heights , with the <unk> of human rights , and the world should be <unk> , and the world should be <unk> , and the world should be <unk> .
but it &apos;s going to be quite a bit of a wobble , and the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to do that .
so i put that on and made this other film about the great ship , the <unk> .
i was selling this as &quot; romeo and juliet on a ship , &quot; it became an <unk> <unk> <unk> , a passionate movie .
but what i wanted to do was , actually , the real australopithecine of the titanic .
that &apos;s why i did the film .
that &apos;s truth . the studio didn &apos;t know that .
i &apos;ve convinced them by saying , &quot; we &apos;re diving to the wreckage . we movies that <unk> .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the movie .
that &apos;s very important . it &apos;s a good predictor for marketing . &quot;
and i persuaded them to fund a expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is going back to that that your imagination can create a reality .
and then we created a reality in six months later , a reality where i was in a russian <unk> <unk> , four kilometers beneath the surface of the north atlantic , and i was watching the real titanic through a <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that really kind of plumbing .
and the amount of remedy has been huge . we had to build cameras and lights and all sorts of things .
and i noticed how very these <unk> , a <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go into that compound , you &apos;re floating into this dark , moist environment , where no hope is <unk> , if you don &apos;t make it yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s just as though i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the study of the deep sea .
anyway , with curiosity and science . it was all . it was adventure ; it was a curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature that we could then design a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i would see outside of the sea .
in some of the following expeditions , i saw beings in <unk> , and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that haven &apos;t seen any before , and for the science at the time , when we saw them , we didn &apos;t find any words yet .
so that &apos;s really <unk> , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a slightly unusual choice .
after the success of &quot; titanic &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood on the ice for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we came to the <unk> , and we explored them with <unk> .
we came back to the ministry of titanic .
we took little robots that we built , which was a <unk> <unk> .
our intent was , <unk> and looking at the inside of what was never done before .
no one had ever explored the inner inner lining . you had no means for it . so we developed the technology .
now , here i am sitting on the <unk> of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which are quite similar , and i know that once the band has played there .
and i was making a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i actually put it in my mind , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
it felt like i was physically in the <unk> of the titanic of the titanic .
that was the <unk> shape of a <unk> i &apos;ve ever experienced , because before i get around a corner , i &apos;ve always known to know what &apos;s going to be in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i &apos;ve gone through the <unk> , when we were <unk> the film .
and that set was a exact copy of the creation of the <unk> .
so this was an awful experience .
and what she did was i realized that you can use such <unk> <unk> , so your own consciousness in the vehicle , in that other form of existence .
it was really intense .
and maybe a small view of what might happen in a few decades , if you have <unk> to study something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> , which i can think of as an <unk> .
so after these expeditions , we started what we had seen down at the bottom , for example , for example , where we saw these incredibly amazing animals . these are sort of alien , but here on earth .
they live with <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in the sunlight of sunlight , how we do that .
and so you can see animals that are directly close to 500 degrees centigrade , that they can survive there .
at the same time , i was also interested in <unk> , which was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so i ended up looking at the people who are interested in space and doing the nasa and the <unk> , and they go to russia , and they drive to russia , through the mission of the mission to the <unk> <unk> , and then we fly to the international criminal court , and then we fly to the international criminal court , and then we take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end , it ran out that i took <unk> with us in the deep sea .
i took them , and i took them access to the world at the bottom : <unk> , <unk> , people who were interested in such extreme situations , i took them to the vents , so they were able to use them to go through the vents , so they could use them , samples , to test samples and so on .
we were running documentaries , but in fact , science , in fact , <unk> .
that &apos;s where the circle of my existence as a child , when a child , and the execution to reality .
and over the course of this voyage , i learned a lot .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m now thinking , you know , one needs to be a leaders , like a <unk> or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i <unk> these expeditions .
because at a certain point i had to say to myself , &quot; what do i actually do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> movies don &apos;t bring us money .
we &apos;re just going to go through the classroom . we don &apos;t know .
all of you think i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; avatar &quot; and i would have the nails somewhere on a towel on the beach .
i have all these movies , these documentaries , for a very small audience .
no fame , no credit , no money . what are you going to do ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the sake of the challenge -- and the ocean is the most reliable environment that you have . you &apos;re going to do it because of the <unk> , and because of the strange link that comes out when a small group of people are making a team .
because we &apos;ve done all this with only 10 to 12 people who worked for years , and sometimes we were two to three months straight across the sea .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is the second thing you have in front of each other because you have a task that you can &apos;t explain anything else .
when you go to shore and say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the whole thing , all the technique , and the difficulty , the whole technique , when you work on sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain the other . that &apos;s like <unk> , and you can &apos;t explain it . that &apos;s like <unk> , and you can &apos;t explain it .
there &apos;s a connection , a respectful respect .
so when i got back to turn to my next movie , &quot; avatar , &quot; i was trying to use the same leadership , which is that you respected your team and burning your respect .
it was really changed the dynamic .
so i stood back with a small team on <unk> terrain . we &apos;re called &quot; avatar &quot; with a new technique that hasn &apos;t happened before .
very exciting .
it &apos;s an awful challenge .
and we were born for a five-year period of time .
it changed my way of making movies , completely .
there were people who thought we had this <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve transported to the living room .
to me , it was more than a <unk> way to do my job , the actual process that changed in the outcome .
so what can we conclude from all of that ?
what lessons we learned ?
i think , first of all , the curiosity is curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human feature .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the <unk> of your teams is more important than all the <unk> of the world .
to me , young filmmakers that say , &quot; give me a advice , how do i make something like this . &quot;
and i said , &quot; don &apos;t worry about yourself .
it &apos;s going to go for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , you don &apos;t pay attention to yourself , but take risk on you . &quot;
nasa has a <unk> : &quot; failure is not an alternative . &quot;
but in the art , and it has to be fail to be an alternative because there &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
no important endeavor , the innovation of innovation , was ever turned to be external .
you have to be prepared to take these risks .
that &apos;s the thought i &apos;d like to give you to the way i &apos;d like to leave you with . i &apos;m an alternative , fear , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk to you about energy and climate .
and that might be surprising to me , because my favorite research on the foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds , to make the things that we need to invent and deliver to make the poorest two billion of a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even more important than any other on the planet .
<unk> means that their savings account over many years are not going to grow , and we &apos;re too little <unk> , and things are going to change how it can &apos;t fix their fragile environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
so , a climate change is going to be terrible for you .
and also , the key quantity for them is very important .
the fact is that , if you could reduce the price of the price of the price , it would be the price of the price of the price at risk .
now , the <unk> is over time .
in fact , it &apos;s based on <unk> .
the <unk> of the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a rapid case in the <unk> , and so we &apos;ve got refrigerators , <unk> , we can make modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the wealthy world .
but if we reduce the price -- let &apos;s put the price down -- let &apos;s meet a new barrier , and that barrier corresponds to the footprint .
co2 warms the planets and the equation for carbon dioxide is actually quite clear .
it <unk> the <unk> carbon dioxide , which is <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences , and maybe worse , the weather , and perhaps worse , the <unk> consequence that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt such rapid changes , and thus <unk> all the systems .
now , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the <unk> <unk> , and where their other consequences are there , there are some shells , but not very many .
and there &apos;s certain materials about how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad .
i asked the <unk> several times , &quot; do we really have to get down to zero ?
isn &apos;t half the half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we get close to zero , the temperature will continue to increase .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying , we have a 3.5 m truck , which is under a three meter bridge , and then you can sort of make it out of it .
it &apos;s got to go down , down to zero .
now , we repel every year a lot of <unk> , about 26 billion tons .
every american is about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
on average , it &apos;s about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and somehow we have to make changes that are down to zero .
it &apos;s going to be a constant amount of time .
only different economic changes have influenced it at all , and we need to go through <unk> increases , and go to a reduction to zero .
this equation has four factors . a little bit of multiplication . you have this thing left -- carbon dioxide , that you want to go to zero , and that &apos;s going to depend on the number of people in the average , the average energy for every service , the average energy for every service , and the footprint that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of paper and think about how we get that to zero .
it probably needs to be one of these numbers very close to zero .
now that &apos;s a basic algebra , but let &apos;s take it through .
first , we have the population .
today 6.8 billion people live .
and it takes you on nine billion units of moving across 9 billion .
if we are very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> , we could reduce that about 10 percent to 15 percent , but at the time we see a slope around 1.3 .
the second one is the services we use .
it &apos;s all the food we eat , clothing , heating , heating .
these are very good things and <unk> to make these services almost every one on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number goes up .
in the wealthy world , in the top billion , we might be able to do <unk> and less use , but at average , this number will increase every year , and thus more than double , the number of services are going to be put in a single person &apos;s per capita . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ;
now , here &apos;s a very basic service . there &apos;s home light , so that you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
now , for efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there are finally good news .
we have something that isn &apos;t rising .
in addition to different successes in the <unk> , through others , through new methods in the <unk> , there are lots of services , which are some single services to 90 percent .
in other forms , like making <unk> , pc <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , or <unk> , is a much smaller .
in fact , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a reduction by a factor of three or maybe even about a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion in maybe 13 billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough !
so let &apos;s look at the fourth factor -- and this will be an argument -- that &apos;s the amount of carbon that &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s the question of whether you can get that to zero .
if you burn charcoal , no .
if you burn gas , no .
it &apos;s all kinds of genes for electricity today , except renewables , but renewables and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global scale is to create a new system .
we need collusion .
now , when i use the term &quot; miracle , i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the ground is a miracle .
the people here have contributed to the development of this miracle .
usually , there are no echo that you need a miracle to a particular date .
usually , you &apos;re just talking about , and some come , other ones don &apos;t .
but in this case , we have to give <unk> , and we have a miracle in a very short time .
now , i thought , how can i really bring that to ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s making the idea of people here ?
i remember last year , when i was mosquitos , and i kind of liked the people .
the idea was really tangible for them , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos .
for energy , this is what &apos;s going to me .
i decided that the <unk> of fireflies would be my <unk> contribution to the environment here .
so here are a couple of natural fireflies .
you have told me that they don &apos;t bite . actually you don &apos;t even have the glass left .
now , there are all sorts of html things like this , but they all don &apos;t get much .
we need solutions , either one or another , or a couple of views , and even though there are many directions that are looking for people to look for , i really see only five that can make these big demands .
i have <unk> , <unk> , fusion and biofuels .
these might give you a <unk> contribution , and if you were to make better than i would expect , that would be great , but my surprising here is that we have to work at all of these five , and we can &apos;t give them any of them because they &apos;re embarrassed , because all of us have all the problems .
let &apos;s look at the burning fossil fuels in fossil fuel from either coal or gas .
what you have to do there , maybe just , but that &apos;s not . you need to get rid of all the carbon dioxide that comes out after burning , <unk> , under pressure , and then you &apos;ll hope it &apos;s going to be there .
there are a couple of arenas that are going on on 60 percent -- 80 percent of the time , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get to 100 percent of the carbon footprint , but the big challenge here is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who &apos;s going to make it make ?
who can make a difference , which literally has a lot of billions of times larger than any kind of waste that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
that &apos;s a lot of volume .
so this is a tough one .
next : <unk> .
that has three major problems . the cost , especially in <unk> countries , the question is that you really feel that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human disagreement , that the fuel isn &apos;t going to be used for weapons .
and what do you do with the trash ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of concerns about it .
so three very difficult problems that are maybe soluble , and that &apos;s why you should work on that .
the last three of the five of five of these five .
it &apos;s the renewables of how they &apos;re called a lot .
and they have -- even though it &apos;s great that they don &apos;t need any fuel -- they have some drawbacks .
one is the intervention that these technologies are dramatically less less than the ones that are <unk> .
these are <unk> , you speak of many <unk> , thousand times more area than a normal power station .
there &apos;s also other forms of filmmaking .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the whole day , it doesn &apos;t seem every day and as well as the wind doesn &apos;t always exist .
that &apos;s why you have to be able to get out of these vents , you have a way of getting the energy in times as well as it is not available .
so there &apos;s a huge disconnect here . there &apos;s challenges in transmission , and if we say that the energy source of the country is , you need not only the technology , you need to be able to deal with the risk that the energy of where different emerges .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and in order to show the scale , i have all sorts of batteries that are created , looking for cars , computers , cell phones , <unk> , for everything . and that &apos;s what i found out with the amount of electronic energy that uses the world . i found that all the batteries we &apos;re producing now less than 10 minutes of <unk> .
so we need a big breakthrough here , something that is going to be a factor of 100 better than the prevalence of time .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not that easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you try to get these <unk> sources over 20 percent -- 30 percent of the <unk> .
if you want to go to 100 percent of it , you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where should we go : what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project &quot; ? how do we get to the destination ?
what we need are many companies working on this . hundreds of companies .
in each of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
so many will they say , they &apos;re crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group there are a lot of people here in the ted group .
bill gross has several companies , among other words , one called the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies doing great things and interesting opportunities , and i try to encourage that .
nathan myhrvold and i funding a company that might take a long way to take the nuclear blast .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
the development has been stopped in this industry , so it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts .
the <unk> means that you would be instead of a part of the fittest , which is one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
that &apos;s a pretty scary idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never be able to see if it was going to work , but since there &apos;s modern supercomputer , you can simulate it and see that , yes ! with the right <unk> , it looks like that .
and because you burn that 99 percent , the <unk> is much better .
in fact , you burn the trash , and you can even use the waste of today from today &apos;s reactors .
so instead of cutting down the head , they just burn it . a great thing .
the uranium is used , it uses a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s a kind of column , often as &quot; the golden wave . &quot;
that really triggers the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
that &apos;s the waste , the 99 percent . you have the part that &apos;s going to be used today , so it &apos;s called <unk> uranium .
this is how hundreds of years of the u.s. intelligence for hundreds of years .
and when you get <unk> cheaply and just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there are many challenges , but it &apos;s an example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure success .
what should our testimony look like ?
now , let &apos;s go to the goal we have to reach , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many are about 80 percent reduction by 2050 .
it &apos;s really important for us to get there .
the rest of 20 percent are created in the poor countries , as well as a bit of agriculture . hopefully it &apos;s going to be more <unk> and there to be clean .
so , to reach those 80 percent , we have to have the cultural world , including countries like china , their <unk> .
the other note , whether we &apos;re using the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all the developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be a key element of this .
if we go back from there , how should that look like 2020 ?
it should contain the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to put reduction on the way , and the less we &apos;re doing , the less we &apos;re going to be the <unk> , and the temperature is also the temperature .
but in fact , this note for the things that we &apos;re doing , which is not entirely to the big breakthroughs , only the same , or even something less important as the other , which is the speed of innovation for this breakthroughs .
we have to be able to track <unk> , and we can measure it : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are lots of great books to this subject .
the al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have the choice &quot; and david <unk> <unk> <unk> the hot air . &quot;
they really do it through and create a framework where this can be done across , because we need help from all sides .
there &apos;s a lot of things that needs to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very regular wish that we invent this technology .
if you give me a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love that wish , or i could choose that wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without carbon , i &apos;ll take that wish .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get these wish , the dig between the long and the southern people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor and rich , and almost all life of these two billion will be much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
what are i going to do ?
we have to apply to more objects .
when countries meet in places like <unk> , they shouldn &apos;t just talk about carbon dioxide .
they should talk to these <unk> , and they &apos;d be shocked by the ridiculously low resources that are going to be spent on these innovative types .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> &amp; amp ; trade something that creates a <unk> .
we have to spread the news .
we need to be experimenting with dialogue and we have the things that are being done by the government .
it &apos;s a very important wish , but i think we can fulfill him .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you very much . just to understand something better -- well , can you give us an idea of magnitude of these investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , to get all the great scientists , which we have done , we only need a few 10 million . and even if we tested our materials in a russian reactor , to make sure that it &apos;s going to work , you &apos;re just in the <unk> million .
the hard step is the building of the first charter to find other billion , the <unk> and the place of actually building the first one .
when the first thing that &apos;s done when it &apos;s done as i promised , it &apos;s all clear , because the amount of money is so different than at <unk> , as we know it .
and to understand that , it &apos;s going to be true in the ground , almost like a vertical column <unk> , which is <unk> , and then the process starts on top , and it &apos;s going to work on the other hand , and then continue to further down ?
<unk> : right now , you &apos;ve got to rethink the wall always , so there are lots of people and lots of controls that go wrong . this thing is where you open and <unk> it . that &apos;s not good ! that &apos;s not good ! that &apos;s not good . that &apos;s not good ! that &apos;s not good . that &apos;s not good ! that &apos;s not good . that &apos;s not good ! that &apos;s not good . that &apos;s not good ! that &apos;s not good . that &apos;s not good ! that
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can do it for 60 years -- think of a column -- you bury , without all the complexities .
and it &apos;s sitting there for 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which is even a solution for the trash .
<unk> : yeah . now , what happens to the waste : you can sit it -- there &apos;s much less waste with this technique -- then you put it and put it in the next reactor and burn it .
and we start by taking the trash that has already exists , which is already in these <unk> or <unk> at the reactors . that &apos;s our <unk> .
so what &apos;s a problem that &apos;s a problem , what we &apos;re doing in our <unk> , and that &apos;s actually going to dramatically reduce the <unk> dramatically in that process .
but while you &apos;ve been talking to different people in the world .
where &apos;s the interest of interest , which is really what &apos;s going on ?
<unk> : now we haven &apos;t yet moved to a place , and there &apos;s a lot of interesting ways for everything that is called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there are big interest and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- i was here , and i &apos;ve been talking to the <unk> , and we &apos;ve been talking about how this is the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is an alternative one thing that was done .
this is a very important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster reactor , and some countries have built that , so everyone who &apos;s built a fast reactor , is a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination : <unk> and likelihood of doing something really to live in life ?
<unk> : now we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , we have 20 years to invent , and then 20 years to use .
that &apos;s kind of the deadline that we have had the <unk> that we have to build .
and , you know , <unk> , when all goes well , and that &apos;s a big wish , it might be light .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of ones , and we need hundreds of ones , if their approaches work for their career working for their pilots to be able to do it .
and it would be best if there were several , because then you could use a mixture .
but anyway , we need a solution .
so , the big possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important .
it would have been without the <unk> , but the power of doing it even more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know about their work as well as these , but there &apos;s the modular method , that &apos;s another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> , which seems a little difficult , but maybe they tell us about us .
and so there &apos;s different , but the nice thing about this is that a million times a million times a million times as much energy as one , say , a <unk> , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , and those are the radiation laws , the footprint and the cost , the <unk> , the implications of the country , is the potential to the country and the other things , the potential to the country and the other .
if that doesn &apos;t work , what ?
should we be <unk> <unk> to try and keep the <unk> stable stable ?
<unk> : when you get too much in this situation , it &apos;s like having too much food , and it &apos;s just about a heart attack -- what do you do ? you might need a <unk> or something .
there &apos;s a trickiness which is called <unk> , which is <unk> with various techniques to help warming the warming , so that we &apos;re going to transplant 20 or 30 years pass for us .
that &apos;s just a <unk> .
you hope that we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you know , you don &apos;t want to work on the insurance because you might be enjoying it , because you &apos;re going to eat , because you know that you &apos;re going to be saving .
i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s smart , if you take the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s now a discourse in <unk> talks about whether you should have that , if things are going to get faster , or that innovation takes longer than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sets of sentences for that , you might be able to convince them ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the skeptics live in very different camps .
the ones that make the scientific arguments are very little .
do you know that there are negative implications that have to do with the clouds that move things ?
there are very , very few things that you can do at all , which is an opportunity in a million .
the <unk> here is kind of like aids .
you make a mistake now , and you pay a lot later .
and that &apos;s why the idea is , now , if you have all kinds of problems to invest in something that you &apos;ve only got -- and that &apos;s not so clear that the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc doesn &apos;t necessarily have the worst thing , and there are people in the wealthy world , and there are people in the wealthy world who look at ipcc and say , okay , that &apos;s not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should worry us .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economically , and once the carbon footprint , then the skeptics also says , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t know that there &apos;s no carbon <unk> , i &apos;ll just accept it , but i &apos;ll accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be your answer to the <unk> argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the footprint of the footprint , all the other targets of suffering , the <unk> , the immediacy of malaria and so forth that there are a stupid waste of resources that we can do .
<unk> : well , the real spending of research on research -- let &apos;s spend 10 billion per year more than they do today -- that &apos;s not as dramatic .
amongst other things should not suffer .
you get too big <unk> , and there are sensible people here , if you have something that &apos;s not economic , and trying to fund that . for me , most of the waste is going on .
it &apos;s because , you know , you &apos;re very short in front of a <unk> and funded only the learning curve . i think we should try more things that have the potential to have a lot more efficient .
if the sailors that you get , a very high <unk> , you can only keep the rich .
i mean , each of us here can spend five times as much for our energy without changing its lifestyle .
but for the lower two billion , it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> think .
his new <unk> is now , &quot; why is no going to do research on this research ? &quot;
it &apos;s still going to be , because of his earlier stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very lonely group , and so it &apos;s now going to be the <unk> .
and that &apos;s a forum that i think is appropriate .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little the support is .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking about all the people here , when i say , i really hope your wish is true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a few years ago here at ted , peter <unk> wrote a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
now , the idea is quite simple . <unk> need to have the natural structure structure with 20 spaghetti , about a blue duct tape , about orange <unk> and a marshmallow .
the marshmallow needs to be on top .
and even though it seems really simple , it &apos;s really hard , because it &apos;s really hard for people to move very quickly .
and so i thought this was an interesting idea , and i turned it into a <unk> .
it was a huge achievement .
since then , i &apos;ve done about 70 workshops around the world , with students , of students and architects , even with <unk> , and there &apos;s something about that problem , which is <unk> sensations into the nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them with you a few of them .
usually most people start to orient themselves on the task .
they talk about what it &apos;s going to look like , it <unk> around .
then they invest in planning and organization . they enjoy and put spaghetti sauce .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> all the time .
and then finally , shortly before you don &apos;t have time to get the marshmallow , you put it on the top , and you put it on the top , you get a step back and forth , you admire your work .
but then , what happens , almost always , is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is &quot; <unk> &quot; to a &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the brain is causing that the whole thing is going to be <unk> and <unk> .
there &apos;s a series of people who have a lot more <unk> than others , and under the worst , fresh <unk> .
they lie , they &apos;re confused , they &apos;re confused and produce really exquisite shapes .
and of course , we have teams that have a lot more &quot; <unk> , &quot; and under the best ones are fresh employees of the <unk> .
and that &apos;s quite amazing .
as we &apos;re making peter , they &apos;re not only producing the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask is : how does that ? why ? what about those ?
and peter told you , &quot; none of the children &apos;s time at the time of the spaghetti <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> has been trained to find the one right plan , ok !
and then realizing it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time to have time and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what &apos;s different is that they start to start with the marshmallow and build prototypes , successful prototypes , on the top of the top , so that they have the opportunity to fix <unk> prototypes .
<unk> see this kind of collaboration as a core of a <unk> .
and with each trial , the kids get instant feedback , which is not .
so the performance of working with prototypes is significantly -- but let &apos;s look at how different teams are going on .
most of the average american is about <unk> , <unk> , half of them , lawyers do a little bit more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , for happiness .
one is the most important thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand triangles and examples of geometric patterns are the key to build stable structures .
tedtalks are something about average . but it &apos;s going to be interesting .
you have a <unk> administrator on the team , you &apos;ll get significantly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you look around and see that team will win . &quot;
you can predict that . why does that happen ?
because they have special skills of the <unk> .
they conduct the process , they understand it .
and the team that regulates up and look at work is going to look at the performance of teams dramatically dramatically improve .
common capabilities and <unk> and their combination lead to success .
if you have 10 teams that are typical , you get about six , the stable structures .
i was trying to do something interesting .
i thought , we &apos;re going to put the <unk> in the same way .
so i offered a $ 50,000 price of software for the winner .
what do they think they were doing with these <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this is what happened . not a team had a stable structure .
if somebody had built a <unk> high school , he would have carried the price home .
so isn &apos;t it interesting that high stakes have a strong effect ?
so we <unk> this exercise with the same students .
what do you think that happened ?
now she understood the benefits of &quot; pioneer . &quot;
that &apos;s how it was made by the same , bad team of one under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the near time .
so there are <unk> lessons for us , about nature and success .
so , you might ask , why would someone actually make a difference in time ?
the reason is , i create digital tools and processes to help teams , to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what &apos;s going on is they &apos;re helping them to identify with them hidden assumptions .
because frankly , every project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge offers a shared experience , a shared language , or a common language , to build the actual prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , that simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested can go to <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find insane examples from all over the world , how people optimize the system and <unk> .
there &apos;s also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think , is actually a <unk> sport .
it requires that we all take our senses to the task , and we &apos;re using our thinking to think of how our feelings and our do , in the challenge that we face .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all that it takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to a &quot; <unk> &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
do we have a machine .
a great machine , a cool , dignified machine , and that &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room needs to be in .
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future ; you can &apos;t go to the future .
and i wonder what you would vote because i was asking my friends in last time , and they all wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter or &quot; america is looking for the superstar . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m sure you &apos;re somehow drawn to the <unk> , and you &apos;re drawn to it .
and that &apos;s what i understand .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to be in the past , and that &apos;s not because i &apos;m a adventurers .
it &apos;s because opportunities on this planet doesn &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the greatest time that there was ever on this planet , no matter what scale you &apos;re doing : health , affluence , mobility , mobility , opportunities , opportunities .
it never had a time like this .
my <unk> were all dying than they were 60 .
my grandparents <unk> this number to <unk> .
my parents are the 80 to the <unk> .
so there was better one nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that .
now , a child that &apos;s born in new england is to live as long as the richest man in the world 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . the smallpox have killed billions of people on this planet .
they have changed the demographics of the earth in a way that no war has ever done .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve questioned them . pop .
in the wealthy world , there are diseases that millions of us have even threatened to one generation , hardly even more .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
anyone even remember what that is ?
other organizations , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , are successes of the scientific method .
and from my perspective , the scientific method of trying to try and see if it works , changing it , if it doesn &apos;t , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news , because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been hearing a bunch of other problems .
and one of them is that all of our discoveries have a billion people in the world every day hungry .
this number goes up , and it &apos;s very quick , and that &apos;s embarrassing .
and not only that , we &apos;ve been using our imagination to get out of the world .
wild , moist land , rainforests , oil , gas -- they disappear , and if we don &apos;t get rid of this chaos , we &apos;re going to disappear .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people without the land where they live , to rape .
i think we can feed this world with energy that doesn &apos;t exist at the same time .
i really believe that , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is going to wake me at night -- one of the things that got me awake at night , we &apos;ve never had scientific progress as well as now .
and we &apos;ve never been able to get rid of him as we can today , as we can today .
we &apos;re on the cusp of amazing , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we have to go back hundreds of thousands of years before the enlightenment , to find a time where we have pioneering progress , in which we have moved on these things , in more evidence than now .
the people are clinging to their faith , so tightly that you can &apos;t free them .
not even the truth gets free .
and listen , everybody has a right to his opinion ; even a law on his opinion .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
you don &apos;t have a right to your own facts . &apos; <unk> , don &apos;t have you .
and i took a while to figure that out .
so , about a decade ago , i wrote an article on the new yorker for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was struck to come across resistance , towards what &apos;s at the end of what &apos;s at the end of the most effective operation in the history of mankind .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i always do , i wrote an article and continued .
and soon , i wrote an article about transformation transformation .
the same thing is only bigger .
people were mad .
so i also wrote an article about this , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought that would be , &quot; <unk> , why they believed that molecules in a particular rather than a random species of nature was in the field of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the article , i kept on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalist .
we &apos;re going to be able to type , we &apos;re going to eat , that &apos;s okay .
but this article was worried about me , and i couldn &apos;t find out why , and i found it out .
and that &apos;s because these fanatics that didn &apos;t take me out at all .
these were people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that took me so hard ...
but then i thought , you know what , let &apos;s face .
we &apos;re at a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship as we did before .
we &apos;re talking <unk> .
we &apos;re talking a little bit of a few of them , with little <unk> , &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there &apos;s reasons , and i think we know what the reasons are .
we have the confidence in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science , there &apos;s no reason that it should not be like that .
you can just call a few names and people will understand .
, <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , weapons of mass destruction , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can vote your own list .
there are questions and problems with the people that we believed that they were always right , so they were incredulous .
so , ask them , demand of it , demand them .
you don &apos;t take anything as granted .
but now , if you get evidence , if you get evidence , you have to think that evidence , and we &apos;re not good at it .
and i can tell you that we now live in an epidemic of fear life , as i &apos;ve never seen them , and hopefully i &apos;ll never see it again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published , a terrible history , which was <unk> the <unk> with the measles , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine .
very scary .
now , studies have been conducted to see if that &apos;s true .
in fact , studies are supposed to be done . that &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no correlation , no .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because we believe in anecdotes , we think what we think we think what we think is what we think we &apos;re really dealing with .
we don &apos;t believe in a bunch of documents from a <unk> who gives us data , and i understand that , i think we all do that .
but you know what ?
and the result of that was devastating .
so , because of the fact , the united states is one of the only countries in the world , where the <unk> are <unk> for measles .
that &apos;s <unk> , and we should be embarrassed .
it &apos;s awful .
what &apos;s happening that we could do that .
now , i understand that . i do .
because there &apos;s somebody here ?
is one in the audience who &apos;s going to be a person in the audience ?
isn &apos;t very often very often .
isn &apos;t in this country at all , but 160,000 once in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of deaths from measles , 20 per hour .
but because it &apos;s not going to happen here , we can put it in , and people like jenny can be <unk> and <unk> from fear and <unk> of platforms like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do that because they don &apos;t connect the cause of cause and correlation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same , but almost never the same thing .
and that &apos;s something we have to learn , which is very quick .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he &apos;s got us from one of the most remarkable <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he &apos;d just evolved a few other people .
he can save the lives of <unk> , 500,000 children a year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
now , that &apos;s good , except that paul grains and other people are talking about vaccines and how valuable they are , and that people should stop waiting to him .
and that &apos;s really what he says .
so paul is a terrorist terrorist .
when paul <unk> talks about it , he can &apos;t tell the <unk> .
he gets calls home , because people like to tell him they know where their kids go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need that , but vaccines are essential .
if you keep them down , the diseases that &apos;s going back , terrible disease , and that &apos;s happening .
we &apos;re now licensed in this country now .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon , kids will die again , because that &apos;s just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die of measles .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s do that . why not ?
a group of mine had written me a few weeks ago , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m a little bit of <unk> . &quot;
nobody ever said that before .
she wasn &apos;t going to <unk> her child for <unk> <unk> . no way .
fair .
why ? because we don &apos;t have disembodied . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t know about this country in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , perhaps this morning , someone in lagos into a plane and flies just after los angeles , right now , is about ohio .
and in a few hours , he ends up and <unk> a car , and it &apos;s going to look after long beach , and it &apos;s going to be one of these <unk> <unk> tonight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know , because this is how the world works now .
that &apos;s the planet that we live on . don &apos;t you pretend it &apos;s not .
we love to scratch ourselves in lie . we love that .
did you take all your vitamins ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that helps you to the <unk> .
i know you &apos;ve done that because half of americans are doing that every day .
they take that stuff , and they take an alternative cures , and it doesn &apos;t make any difference , how often we find that they &apos;re useless .
the data is all the time .
they &apos;re using their urine . more , they almost never .
that &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine .
i agree with them .
wasteful urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
now , i think i understand -- we hate the drug .
we hate too strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our healthcare system is <unk> .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s totally cold and <unk> itself to us who can afford it .
so we &apos;re running away , and where are we running ?
we &apos;re going into the arms of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that &apos;s really serious because the stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars for it .
and i have all kinds of little props here .
none of it -- <unk> , fraud , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we spend billions of dollars for it , it &apos;s been .
and you know what ? when i say that , people cry at me and say , &quot; what cares it ? let people do it ? let people do what they want .
that &apos;s how they feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you have wrong .
because i don &apos;t care about whether it &apos;s the <unk> who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m going to take the evidence of my experts to mammography , &quot; or any <unk> who wants to treat his patients with <unk> .
when you go to this path where belief and magic can replace science and science , you &apos;re going to be a place where you don &apos;t want to be .
they go to <unk> <unk> in southern africa .
he killed 400,000 his people because he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than antiretroviral drugs , which we know that they are <unk> the trajectory of aids .
hundreds of thousands of deaths in a country , which is worse than any other from this disease .
i don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have . they always have .
now , the <unk> epidemic where we &apos;re right now is this famous fight between the <unk> , <unk> foods and the <unk> .
that &apos;s a <unk> debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about metaphors .
that &apos;s ideology , not science .
all we eat , each <unk> , every branch , each <unk> , was transformed by the people .
you know , there were no <unk> in paradise .
there were no <unk> .
there were no <unk> . we did all this .
we &apos;ve done it in the last 11,000 year .
and some of it has worked , and some of it doesn &apos;t work .
we are fanatics what hasn &apos;t worked .
now we can do it more . and , of course , there &apos;s risks . but we can do something like 25,000 a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , to prolong their lives .
they don &apos;t want to do it ?
i have to say that i don &apos;t understand .
we experimentally inoculate food .
why do we do that ?
now , what i hear about all the time is too many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we don &apos;t want to have huge storage with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to own seeds .
and you know what my response to all this is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . we &apos;re going to do that .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
it &apos;s not going to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know , science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow the science to do their job , because we &apos;re afraid of anxiety , and it lasts millions of people from flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than currently . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
puzzle . bad .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give it to them .
and why ? vaccine changes .
we want to encourage people to eat this funny stuff , like cassava .
wetlands is something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s like a potato potato .
it &apos;s just a sack of calories . it &apos;s grossly .
it has no nutrients , it doesn &apos;t have a protein , and scientists build all that in it .
and then people could eat the food and wouldn &apos;t be 3.3 .
they wouldn &apos;t starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be nice .
and all i can say to you is : why do we fight that ?
i mean , why do we fight that ?
because we don &apos;t want to be a little bit of genes ?
it &apos;s not about genes . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insist on more food , better food , more food .
it &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about getting people alive , and it &apos;s going to be time to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do this as far as we do , we &apos;re guilty of something that we do , i think , don &apos;t want to be guilty , high-tech colonialism .
there &apos;s no other description for what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s selfish , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not worthy , and we really have to stop that .
so after this incredibly funny conversation , you might be saying , &quot; you still want to look into this ridiculous machine and go into the future ? &quot;
anyway . that &apos;s what i want to do .
right now , they are in the present , but we have an incredible possibility .
we can put this money on everything we want .
we can rearrange them where we want them to be <unk> , and we &apos;re going to move them where we want .
we have to lead these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go to the machine and go into the future , we &apos;re going to be relieved to go to the future .
i know we can do it , and as far as i &apos;m concerned , this is what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for quite a long time , i &apos;m interested in the <unk> . it might seem strange that a magician is interested in it , unless you look at it as i am , as a delusion that &apos;s going to be a bit of a true thing to do when you &apos;re only holding it to something that &apos;s true . &quot;
in other words , <unk> have shown a measurable impact , which is just because the person feels , because the person thinks it &apos;s going to happen with her , is a <unk> , or a kind of ... in the <unk> , for instance , if the patient is only holding enough attention to it , you know , if the patient is only holding enough attention to it .
a deception becomes true to something , because somebody uses it like this .
so , if we can understand each other , i want to show you a basic , very simple kind of magic .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick , which is at least for the 1950s in each room for children .
i &apos;ve learned him from the <unk> <unk> magic company in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for you and then explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explain him .
so you see what happens .
the knife that you can study is , my hand you can study .
i &apos;ll just hold the knife so in my writing .
i push my sleeves back .
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , or out of him , i &apos;m just going to just recycle my wrist right here .
in this way , you can see that no time is anything , as long as i &apos;m sleeping here , there &apos;s nothing in my sleeve or coming out .
and the goal is very simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , hopefully , if all goes well , the knife will <unk> through my bare physical magnetism .
in fact , it &apos;s so clear to his place that i can shake it without the knife for the knife .
nothing goes into my sleeve or coming out , no <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i have a lot of young kids looking for magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , when you look at it , when you look at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
it &apos;s probably many of you in the room here in the room .
he works .
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i <unk> my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , or coming out , and that &apos;s a lie .
the reason i <unk> my wrist , is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i put my hand from them so they can see you from the back , this finger here , just from where he was , where he was , in a position where he was so <unk> .
amazing trick ?
there &apos;s somebody who didn &apos;t have a childhood .
so , he &apos;s here . right .
and when i zoom in , the fingers changes its position .
and now you might talk about why that &apos;s a deception , why you don &apos;t know that there &apos;s only three fingers , because the truth and the way it is information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three , but it &apos;s a group .
but that &apos;s not really what &apos;s going on now . and then i open my hand .
and of course , it &apos;s going to pass there , but not by the magnetism of my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , which is now there .
and when i close my hand , the same thing happens by getting me through this movement , that the fingers back again .
i take this hand away . and here &apos;s the knife .
you can demonstrate your friends and neighbors . thank you .
now , what does that have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , i read a study that was really involved in me .
i &apos;m not a doctor or scientists , and so that was an amazing thing to me .
and it turns out that if you offer a dummy in the shape of a white pill in the form of a white pill , it &apos;s just a round white experience that has a certain measurable effect .
but if you give the shape where you put it in a smaller pill , for example , it &apos;s going to be a smaller pill , and that color color , and a letter on it , is actually measurable .
and that , although none of these -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really cool .
it turns out that that &apos;s not all about it .
if you take capsules , that &apos;s more effective than any shape .
there &apos;s a colored capsule that &apos;s yellow , and on the other red , is better than a white capsule .
the personality plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as good as three pills -- i can &apos;t remember the exact statistic now . sorry .
now , the critical thing is , ...
and that &apos;s also the <unk> of a role .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to reach out on the needle .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> of a <unk> substance you &apos;re using a patient .
that produces a very strong picture in your head . that &apos;s much stronger than a white pill .
now , this chart is really -- i &apos;ll show you another time when we have a projector .
in fact , the white pill didn &apos;t work as well as the blue pill , which doesn &apos;t work as well as a force that doesn &apos;t matter as well as the needle .
and none of it has any really exquisite property . it &apos;s only our belief that we make a stronger impact .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic .
i &apos;m going to take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and let &apos;s look at it .
now , we know from the trial that you have to reach out to the needle if it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
this is a long period of time capsule . she &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to start a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a <unk> .
this is really my meat . it &apos;s not <unk> special meat .
this is my skin . this is not a particularly hollywood from hollywood .
i &apos;m going to stick these needle into my skin and pull through them through it until they get back on the other side .
if you &apos;re going to fall out , if you drop out of frustration -- i &apos;ve got that a couple of friends in the hotel room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s where a woman has become nearly powerless .
so i &apos;m going to propose to you , if you look quickly quick , you look at the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i &apos;m going to do the first multicultural part here .
you can see it right there , you can also <unk> if you want to .
so , right here , right here , where my meat starts , at the lower part of my arm , i &apos;ll just make a little <unk> .
i &apos;m really sorry . do you get that crazy ?
and just a little bit through my skin and on the other hand , so again .
now we &apos;re actually in the same context that we had in <unk> .
about that .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so , i &apos;ll show you . that &apos;s one , two , three , four , five .
well , yes , well , yes .
i know what people think when you see that .
you say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and <unk> yourself the skin , just to talk for a few minutes . &quot;
now , i &apos;ll show you .
how does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back would say , &quot; okay . i haven &apos;t seen that right . &quot;
the people in the <unk> are now running .
so let me show you from close to them .
that &apos;s really my skin . this is not a particularly hollywood from hollywood .
that &apos;s my meat , and i can do this .
i sorry . if you look carefully , look away , don &apos;t look at it .
the people in the back , or the ones that are going to see this later at some point , will say , &quot; well , that &apos;s pretty impressive , but if it &apos;s true , it would be -- see , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it &apos;s really real , it would bleed . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little touch for you .
yes , here it is .
so i would take the needle now .
i would shrink my arm and show them that there are no lesions .
but i think in this frame here , and with the purpose of making something real , i &apos;ll just leave the needle out there and go off the stage .
we &apos;re going to face a couple of times in the next few days .
i hope you &apos;ll be looking at it . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness today .
i &apos;ve got a few people counting the number of books that have been released with &quot; happiness &quot; in the last five years , and they &apos;ve got a lot more to about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a tremendous wave of interest in happiness about researchers .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these flood of work , there are several cognitive dumped that make it almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is mostly breaking by these cognitive things .
it &apos;s true of <unk> that think about your own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are exactly as mess as everybody else .
the first one is a <unk> , complexity , complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is simply not a useful word , because we apply it to lots of different things .
i think there &apos;s a particular meaning that we might be able to make it , but in the large and all of that , that &apos;s something we &apos;re going to be going to give to be called , and we &apos;re going to have to embrace the complicated view of what well-being is .
the second case is a sound of experience and memory : basically , it &apos;s basically be true in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third one is the <unk> , and that &apos;s the unfortunate fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that affects well-being , without understanding its significance .
i mean , that &apos;s a real cognitive event .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of someone who had a <unk> after one of my lectures , who was a history reported . &#93; he said he had a symphony , and it was absolutely splendid music , and at the end of the recording , there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he added , really , really emotional , that ruins the whole experience .
but that didn &apos;t .
what it was ruins was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience .
he had 20 minutes of <unk> music .
she didn &apos;t know because he was with a memory of <unk> ; it was memory , and memory was anything that he had gotten to keep on .
what really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about other people , in the sense of two types of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present , and the present is able to experience the past , but it &apos;s basically just the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> itself , which is the doctor &apos;s office -- you know , when the doctor says , &quot; does it still hurt if i &apos;m going to <unk> you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> self is that , the <unk> and the history of our lives , and it &apos;s the one that doctor &apos;s doctor would be overwhelmed by asking the question , &quot; how did you felt at last time ? &quot;
or , &quot; how was your journey to albania ? &quot; or something like that .
these are two very different ranges , the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and the two is part of the <unk> of happiness in happiness .
now , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and that really starts with a fundamental response to our memories -- it &apos;s beginning immediately .
we don &apos;t just tell stories if we &apos;re doing it to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re allowed to talk about from our loved ones .
and let &apos;s start with one example .
there &apos;s an old trial .
these are actual patients that make a painful procedure .
i &apos;m not going to go into the details . it &apos;s not painful , but it was painful when this trial was conducted in the 1990s .
they were asked to report all 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are your records .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who from two has more suffered ? &quot;
and that &apos;s a very simple question .
cybercriminals b has more developed . his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a patient b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question , &quot; how did those patients thought that they were going to be ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient a much worse <unk> on the <unk> had been to the <unk> as a patient b.
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very broad part of the story is how she ends .
and none of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clear worse than the other .
and the ones that was worse , where the pain was at the end of his peak , it &apos;s a terrible history .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people to be asked , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and she was much worse than b in the <unk> .
now , this is a direct conflict between the <unk> itself and the <unk> itself .
in fact , in the view of the <unk> self , b has got a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually did clinical trials , and it &apos;s been done , and it &apos;s worked , and it &apos;s working , you could actually put the <unk> of patient a balls by just putting the tube in there without firing .
that &apos;s what causes that the patient suffers , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you do that for a few minutes , you &apos;ve made that the <unk> itself is a bad thing , and you &apos;ve got that the <unk> self &apos;s self is a much better off , because now you &apos;ve given patient a better story of your experience .
what &apos;s a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that memory us , and it &apos;s also true for the stories we invent .
it &apos;s a story <unk> <unk> , more wiser and ends .
<unk> are very , very important , and in this case , the end .
now , the <unk> itself lives his life .
it &apos;s got moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask , what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they &apos;re lost forever .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i think that -- you know , the psychological present is about three seconds . what does , you know , there &apos;s about 600 million of them , in a month , there &apos;s about 600 million of them . in a month , most of you don &apos;t leave out .
most of them are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet , you get the impression that you should count that what &apos;s going on during that moments of human rights is our lives .
it &apos;s the finite resource we use as we are in the world .
and how do we use them to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that <unk> itself for us .
so we have the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the amount of time .
from the point of view , if you have a vacation , and the second week is just as good as the first one , then the <unk> vacation is twice as good as the <unk> vacation .
that doesn &apos;t work at all for the <unk> itself .
so for the <unk> self , a barely vacation can &apos;t be much better than the <unk> vacation , because there &apos;s no new memories there .
they didn &apos;t change the story .
and in this way , there &apos;s time to be the critical variable that is a <unk> itself from a <unk> self . time has very little influence on this story .
now , the <unk> itself is more than remembering to remember and tell stories .
it &apos;s actually a matter of understanding the choices , because if you have a patient who , let &apos;s say two <unk> of two different types and decides that he should choose to do , is the guy who has memory that memory the memory that &apos;s less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s going to be picked up , and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s going to be picked up , and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s going to be picked up , and that &apos;s the surgeon that &apos;s going to
the <unk> itself has no voice in that choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t actually choose between nurses . we &apos;re not vote among memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as experiences .
we think about our future as a <unk> memories .
and in fact , you can look at that , you know , as an tyranny of self &apos;s self , and you can think of the <unk> itself as one , that sort of <unk> the <unk> itself through experiences that doesn &apos;t need the <unk> itself .
i have the impression that if we do this , it &apos;s very often the case , which is , we &apos;re doing vacation in the service of the <unk> itself .
and that &apos;s a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> do we get from our memories ?
that &apos;s one of the explanations that &apos;s been given to the domination of the <unk> .
and when i think about it , i think of a vacation that we did a few years ago in antarctica , which was clearly the best one i had ever had , and i think quite often in relation to other forms of time .
and i probably have about my memories of this <unk> journey , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i ever opened the folder , with the 600 pictures of it , i spent another hour .
now , these are three weeks , and that &apos;s about a quarter of hours .
there seems to be an africa .
now , i may be a little extreme , you know , how little i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you do more of that , if you give more of that . why do we give memories so much weight on the <unk> to the weight that we &apos;re advising ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
so , imagine your next vacation , you know , at the end of all , all your images will be removed , and you get a <unk> drug so that you &apos;re going to remember anything .
now , would you vote at the same vacation ?
and if you &apos;re going to vote for another vacation , there &apos;s a conflict between your two types of self , and you have to think about how you decide that conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious , because if you think in the sense of time , you might have a answer , and if you think in your sense , you might think of a different answer .
why we choose the <unk> that we chose is a problem that presents us with a choice of the two types of self .
now , the two types of self , two terms of happiness .
in fact , there are two concepts of happiness that we can use , a per capita self .
so you can ask , how happy is the <unk> itself ?
and then you would ask , how happy are the moments of the moments itself ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re now able to get a pretty good idea of happiness itself over time .
when you ask happiness about the <unk> of the <unk> , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
it &apos;s not about how happy one person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or pleased is the person if that person &apos;s thinking about their lives .
very different terms .
and anybody who &apos;s not going to distinguish these terms is going to be the exploration of happiness , and i &apos;m a lot of researchers about well-being that have long long history of happiness on exactly that same way .
the distinction between the happiness itself , and the satisfaction of the <unk> itself has been recognized in the last few years , and now you have to measure the two .
the gallup organization has a worldwide survey where more than half a million people have asked about their lives about what they think about their lives and about their experience , and there was other endeavors in the direction . and there were other endeavors in the direction .
so in the last couple years , we started to learn about the two types of ourselves .
and the main lesson we have learned , i think , is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone is with his life , and that doesn &apos;t really tell you much about how happy he lives his life and vice versa .
just to give you a glimpse of the correlation , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you want to meet someone and you would tell them , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his greatness ?
now , you would know something about his height , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
when i tell you that somebody &apos;s living on a scale of 10 decades , you have much uncertainty about how happy he is with his <unk> .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what &apos;s called the happiness .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is going to be content with people we like to spend time with people we like to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but that &apos;s dominant .
so , when you &apos;re going to maximize the two types of the two types of yourself , you &apos;ll end very different things on the end .
the implication of what i said here is that we really ought to imagine happiness as a replacement of well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
now , very quickly , another reason we &apos;re not thinking about happiness is that we &apos;re going to look at the same things when we &apos;re thinking about life , and when we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the proper answer .
when you ask that question , you think that people in california have to be happier if they say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think of the difference between california and other places , and that difference , we say , in climate .
now , it turns out climate isn &apos;t very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self , which decides how happy people are .
now , because the <unk> is responsible , you can end up at the end -- some people could go to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to pursue what &apos;s going to happen with people who are going to come to california to become happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . they &apos;re going to think they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;ll be reminded of how terrible the weather in ohio was in ohio , and you &apos;re going to feel that they have made the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about comfort , and i hope i &apos;ve given you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for you .
thank you .
now , when we talked about a few weeks ago , they listened to me that there was a pretty interesting result that came out of this remarkable survey .
is that something that you can tell us , because you have a few minutes from now ?
daniel libeskind : sure .
i think the most interesting result we found in the gallup survey is a number that we didn &apos;t have expected to find .
we found that in terms of the happiness itself .
when we looked at how feelings that vary income vary .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it &apos;s a big representative sample under the income of 600,000 dollars a year .
60,000 .
<unk> : 60,000 .
two dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re increasingly afraid of the poorer they &apos;re going to be .
we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i &apos;ve seen that flat lines .
what happens is that money doesn &apos;t give you a <unk> , but that lack of money on money are in a sense of misery , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the spirit of the other self , the <unk> itself , you get another story .
the more money you &apos;re more likely to be more serious .
it &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , all the american aspirations is about life , freedom , the pursuit of happiness .
if people were going to take these <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to be all the time , all we think , for instance , in terms of <unk> and so on .
is there an opportunity that politicians that the country would generally take a <unk> like the seriousness , and based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s recognition for the role of <unk> in politics .
the recognition will be slowly slow in the united states , not a question , but in the united kingdom , she &apos;s going to happen in other countries .
the people are realizing that they should think of happiness when they think about politics .
it &apos;s going to take a long time , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore <unk> or they want to explore <unk> , so we need to have that debate quite quickly .
how do you think happiness might be very different depending on how you think and whether you think about the <unk> yourself , or if you think about the <unk> itself .
that &apos;s going to affect politics , i think , in the years .
in the united states , you &apos;ve got to measure the <unk> of the population of the population .
that &apos;s going to be , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it seems to me that , or should at least the most interesting political debate about the next few years .
thank you very much for invention of behavioral economics .
thanks , danny <unk> .
i &apos;m jane mcgonigal . i build video games .
i &apos;ve been building for 10 years , and my aim for the next decade is to make it easy to make it easy to be able to save the world in the reality of how you &apos;re in <unk> .
i have a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including them all , spend more time playing with the play and play .
in fact , we spend three billion hours a week a week .
some of you might think , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe something too much of the time when you think how many problems we &apos;ve got to have a lot of problems in the real world .
in fact , in my research at the center of the future , the opposite is actually the opposite .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough to solving the most of the world &apos;s problems .
in fact , i am convinced that if we want to survive the next century on the planet , we have to dramatically have to dramatically increase that time .
i calculated that they took time at 21 billion hours per week .
that seems to be a little <unk> , so i repeat it , so if we could make problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think , we have to try to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this image is pretty much why i believe games are so essential for survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a tudor portrait of the photographers .
he wanted to make the feelings play playing . so he built a camera in front of the gamers .
this is one of the classic expressions playing .
if you &apos;re not a player , you may have some of the nuances in this picture .
you &apos;re going to see this sense of urgency , something fear , but also daunting concentration , entirely deepened into solving a really difficult problem .
if you &apos;re also playing , you see some of the nuances here , which are <unk> eyes and the mouth are a symbol of optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player who &apos;s on the outskirts of a so-called <unk> .
oh , you know that . ok . so we have some player here .
a <unk> victory is a result which is so incredibly positive that they didn &apos;t know that it was possible at all .
it was almost beyond imagination .
and if you do it , you &apos;re shocked that you actually are capable of doing that . that &apos;s a <unk> victory .
this gamers is just about a <unk> victory .
and this is what we have to see on millions of faces of <unk> all over the world if we take the barriers of the next century , the face of all the <unk> on the outskirts of any <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we &apos;re going to see this face in real life , if we face tough problems .
i call it as the &quot; living in life , &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
that &apos;s me , as i am , &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad .
this is a graffiti in my former home in berkeley , california , where i looked at why we were better than in real life than in real life .
that &apos;s a problem that many players have .
we think we &apos;re not as good as play in games .
and i don &apos;t just think less successful , even though that .
we &apos;re going to be able to do more . i mean , in terms of motivation , with the motivation of doing something <unk> , inspired to collaboration with each other .
when we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us have turned into our best version , anytime , and immediately , the problem is to try to solve the problem , as long as required , for as long as required , it &apos;s going to try again .
and in reality , if we keep failing on obstacles , we &apos;re often feeling a lot differently .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> . we feel threatened , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
we never have , if we play games , in play , they just don &apos;t .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to investigate as a student .
why is it impossible in playing games , you could not just reach anything ?
how can we put those feelings into the reality ?
so i looked at games like world of warcraft that allow the ideal environment to collaborative economies .
and i &apos;ve learned a few things that epic victories can make the epic victories in <unk> .
so , first of all , if you look at one of these <unk> , especially in world of warcraft , there are lots of different characters that are ready to give them a <unk> mission , and immediately , immediately .
but not only does any mission , but a mission that fits perfectly to your current level in the game , right ?
so they do that .
they never get a job that they can &apos;t fix .
but it &apos;s always on the edge of your skills , so you have to do it . but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you &apos;re not sitting around and twirl . there &apos;s always something important to do .
and there are a lot of staff employees .
where you go , hundreds of thousands of people working with them , to finish their epic mission .
that &apos;s not what we &apos;re doing in real life , this feeling that there &apos;s a lot of musical staff ready for a long time .
and there &apos;s also this epic history , this inspirational story , why we are there and what we have to do .
and then we get this whole positive feedback .
they have heard of &quot; level high &quot; and &quot; + 1 strength &quot; or &quot; plus-one 1 intelligence . &quot;
that constant feedback is not in real life .
when i leave that stage , i didn &apos;t -- plus-one a <unk> and plus-one a crazy idea , + 20 <unk> .
i don &apos;t get in real life in the real life of this feedback .
so , the problem of how world of warcraft is that it &apos;s so gratifying , at the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we &apos;re going to spend our entire time in these <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
by today , all the world &apos;s world &apos;s world had spent millions of years to solve the virtual problems of <unk> <unk> . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that &apos;s not something bad .
it might sound terrible .
but to see it in context , about <unk> million years ago , our first <unk> came across .
so the first one ever ended up calling .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend time with play , it makes only sense when you look at the time in terms of human development in human development , which is quite extraordinary .
but it turns out , because it turns out we &apos;re using all the time to play that whole time , in fact , what we &apos;re capable of as humans .
we &apos;re developing ourselves to collaborative , more creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think .
now look at this interesting statistic that recently conducted from a researcher researcher carnegie mellon association : the average young man of today in a country with great <unk> <unk> spends 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for kids in the united states , <unk> hours are the exact ones that spend at school , from the fifth grade to the end of high school -- if you never miss .
so , here we have a full <unk> , where the young people are as learning what it means to be a good player , like anything that you &apos;re learning in high school .
and maybe some of you have the new book by malcolm gladwell , &quot; <unk> &quot; , read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research , which is that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> quarter of any subject to the 21st week , we &apos;re going to be able to master it .
we &apos;re going to do so good at doing whatever the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people that are <unk> .
so the big question is , &quot; what are gamers <unk> good ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out , we would never have any kind of potential human potential .
and so many people have in the world , at least one hour a day a day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people that are extraordinary in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have another billion gamers that are very good in whatever .
if you haven &apos;t heard it yet , you &apos;ve heard .
the <unk> developed <unk> , which is saving the energy and work on <unk> , rather than the <unk> , so that player in the entire world , especially in india , in china , china , china , online , brazil online . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
you expect an extra billion player in the next decade .
and that &apos;s how we have 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is that we do to master those games .
here are the four things that i found . first , <unk> .
ok , imagine what you &apos;re looking at as an ecologist <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something immediately , to have a common thing with belief that we have a poor hope of success .
and he always believe that there &apos;s a <unk> victory , and it &apos;s worth caring about trying to do it , and that &apos;s the same .
in seats don &apos;t sit around .
gamers are masters in the spiders of social dilemmas .
there &apos;s a lot of interesting studies that we might like to do more than we &apos;ve played with them , even if they defeated us .
the reason for that is that it requires a lot of trust to play a game .
we &apos;re advising that there &apos;s time with us that the rules are going to be <unk> , that we have the same goal and to the <unk> .
so the <unk> is making the <unk> of ties , trust and each other .
as a result , we &apos;re building stronger social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s a reason why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours a week , sort of , like <unk> .
the reason is that when we play , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard , when we relax or nothing .
we know that as human beings work , if we work hard , it &apos;s going to do great work .
and player are always prepared to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , epic meaning .
in love , they love to become part of the <unk> area of <unk> .
this is a <unk> to put that into the right light , you know all wikipedia , the world &apos;s largest microfinance .
the second forest of the world , with almost 80,000 <unk> is the world of warcraft .
five million people use it every month .
you &apos;ve got more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other subject in any other branch of the world .
they create a epic story .
they create a epic source of knowledge across the world of warcraft .
okay , so that &apos;s four superpowers that lead to a single outcome . player are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change the world .
and the only problem is you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem i try to fix .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he &apos;s trying to investigate why people spend so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he said , &quot; we &apos;re not going to be less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s from an economist . so it &apos;s logical .
he says ...
not like me -- i play games , i &apos;m a little bit more expressive .
so he says that this actually makes sense , because player can reach more than in real life than in real life .
you can put in playing more powerful social bonds than in real life , and you get more feedback and reward in games than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s totally logical that gamers are more time in the virtual world than the real world .
i &apos;ll just agree with that , that &apos;s logical .
but it &apos;s definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to transform the real world into a game .
my inspiration comes from an event that 2,500 years .
there are these ancient revolutions , from <unk> . you know ?
in these fantastic <unk> , there were <unk> .
and that was kind of the first few people &apos;s first developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the works of the old greek <unk> <unk> , you might know that story , the story of how , why games are invented .
and it &apos;s been <unk> <unk> , more <unk> , in the kingdom of <unk> , famine .
in addition , there was such a big famine , that the king of <unk> was teaching to a crazy idea .
people were hungry . people were hungry .
it was a extreme situation . you needed a extreme solution .
so they invented , <unk> , the <unk> and the <unk> , a national strategy , on a day , you would eat . the next day you would play .
and they would be so excited to be in the <unk> , and they were so fascinating to us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and in fact , <unk> survived it as 18 years of doing this famine , by eating them on a day and playing the nearest .
and so , i think we &apos;re going to put games on games today .
we put games together to escape the suffering of the real world .
we &apos;re playing games to avoid everything that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , which is not really gratifying in real life , and we &apos;re going to bring ourselves what we need .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
it was <unk> after 18 years , after 18 years , the king cobra , so the king , one last <unk> <unk> .
they put the kingdom in two halves .
she played a <unk> , and the score were allowed to give up to a <unk> adventure .
they left <unk> and they went looking for a new home , and they just sat down as many people , as it was food to survive and were looking at the rest after a region where they could thrive .
that sounds crazy , isn &apos;t it ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , which are later the remains of the civilian empire , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so scientists came to think that <unk> &apos;s insane history is actually true .
and geologists found evidence of a global economy that took almost 20 years what could explain the famine .
so this is a crazy story .
you might actually have saved your people through play by 18 years of games in games , and then they had these <unk> and so much about that , and that they learned so much about the entire civilization of that , they found that they were saved by the entire civilization . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing for 1994 .
this was the first <unk> in real world &apos;s world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
it was <unk> for 18 years , and we &apos;ve been playing for 16 years .
i &apos;m going to argue , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , you sent half your civilization to looking for a new world , so i take my 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should <unk> that half of us spend an hour a day at play , until we have solved the problems of the real world .
i know you &apos;re going to be wondering , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in games ? &quot; and that question is , i &apos;ve been devoted to the <unk> for the last couple of years at the center of the book .
we have this banner in our office in palo alto , as we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to tell the future before .
what we want is to create the future .
we want to think about the best outcome , and then people empower to make this idea into reality .
we put ourselves on epic victories and give people the opportunities to reach them .
i &apos;m going to show you very briefly about three games i designed to try and give people epic victories in their own future .
this is &quot; world without oil . &quot;
the game is by 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> where you have to get through a <unk> .
the <unk> is invented , but we have enough <unk> , so that it &apos;s going to be realistic for them , and they &apos;re actually living their real life without oil . so , when you &apos;re looking at play , they tell us where you live . and then you get them to be <unk> in real time , and you have to figure out how to make your real life , if it &apos;s true , and you have to be able to find out how to make your real life .
we tested this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve lost them over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a serious experience .
no one wants to change his life because it should be good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to go out of the oil . &quot;
that &apos;s an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to be .
if you look at how they live , most of our gamers have put that in the play of <unk> habits .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next <unk> game a greater , higher goal than just screwing up .
we &apos;ve developed the game called &quot; <unk> &quot; at the center of the future .
in fact , the computation of a <unk> is that people only have 23 years on the planet .
this supercomputers is called global <unk> <unk> , of course .
now , the call of gamers , gadgets , we have created almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> .
you know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot; you have astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everybody &apos;s in the corporate sector , and it &apos;s our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
8,000 player did the game eight weeks for eight weeks .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we bring on at the third of clubs . it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
when you finish the game , you get from the world bank called social <unk> , in 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in complete france and invite you to learn how social attack .
we have a comic strip . we have &quot; level high &quot; for <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i &apos;d like to invite you all to share this game with young people all over the world , particularly in the world , especially in <unk> , which is benefit to their own social enterprises to save the world .
i &apos;m going to come to the end .
i want to ask you something .
what do you think happened next ?
we have all these fantastic gamers , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world yet .
well , i hope that you agree to me that there are gamers of human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a great meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got these whole superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to knit social networks , <unk> , and the desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re going to play great games to survive on this planet to survive .
and i hope you &apos;ll be able to design these games and play it .
when i go to the next decade , i &apos;m sure in two things : that we can create any ordinary future , and we can play all sorts of games .
so i say , let &apos;s start the <unk> games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you a little bit about what i was writing a few months ago in writing for <unk> wired .
i was always writing my <unk> , but i was with the process of writing , and i realized that i &apos;ve never met in my life , which is what the word &quot; disabled &quot; really means .
i read them the post .
&quot; disabled &quot; , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . &quot;
and i got this list of a friend of mine , and i had to laugh at it , but i was only going to go to &quot; climate change , &quot; and i couldn &apos;t stop <unk> , and i had to stop reading , and i had to go through it for those <unk> <unk> and <unk> emotional shock .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> . i just thought that the issue has to be quite old .
but in fact , this was a edition in the early &apos; 80s when i started elementary school with the elementary school , and i started making my thinking outside of my family &apos;s disease , and forms in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and thank god i didn &apos;t use a research project at that time .
i would be born that post seriously , i would be born into a world that would be somebody like me as a person , which is a person in a sense , and today , but i &apos;m going to be the opportunity and adventure i &apos;ve experienced for the odds and adventure i &apos;ve experienced .
so , i immediately gave myself the <unk> of 2009 , and expect me to find a piece of paper .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
in fact , they &apos;re not much better .
in particular , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about the people we describe with these words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we constructing these values .
our language influence our thinking and how we see the world and the people around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks and the romans , have really believed that the pronunciation of a <unk> has a big force , because what you &apos;re thinking about is , you know , <unk> .
so , what do we actually want to do -- a disabled man or a powerful person ?
just to call a child as a child , it could be enough , it could be driven and show them ideas .
wouldn &apos;t it be nice to open doors ?
a human being opened for me , was my pediatrician at the <unk> dupont of <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , as you can think of most americans don &apos;t have any of the americans , so he &apos;s always called dr. p. .
and dr. p. always wore very colorful flies , and he was just created for work with kids .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had to do a lot of practice as many times as many times as i did with these big , brown <unk> -- in different colors -- you know , to build my <unk> , and i hated these activities to be more hate than anything else . i hated them . i hated them . i hated them .
and imagine i even thought about as a youngster child with dr. p. , and so trying to stop these kinds of applications , <unk> without success .
and one day , he &apos;d been watching me at one of my practice -- these things were just tiring and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re going to be a strong , powerful and young girl , you &apos;ll see one day .
and when you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and that , of course , was a simple trick of dr. analog , so i could do the practice that i didn &apos;t want to make , with the prospect that richest iranian girls in the aftermath of the second time , but he actually helped me to see my everyday <unk> .
and i wonder how much his vision of myself as a powerful and powerful young girl has changed my dramatically , and i could imagine myself as one of nature , powerful and <unk> man .
it &apos;s only one example of many , how adults are able to address the imagination of a child .
but as we &apos;ve seen examples of the <unk> prove , our language doesn &apos;t tell us a space , to imagine what we would all wish to do : allow everyone to be aware of themselves as a powerful people .
our language <unk> the social changes that have triggered in many cases through a technological change .
of course , from the medical point of view , you can say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> from titan and artificial <unk> of ancient bodies that allow people to be able to use their own possibilities , and the limitations that allow them to have their natural political , and it &apos;s changing with the limits that they have to be able to do in their own way , to develop themselves in their own way .
so , maybe this technological change is because ever that there &apos;s always a other truth , which is that every human being can give something entirely violent and very powerful , and that the human ability to adapt to adapt , is our biggest asset .
the human ability to adapt -- this is an interesting story because people always ask me to tell you how i &apos;m dealing with <unk> , and i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about that , and i &apos;ve always felt very uncomfortable with people to answer the questions of people , and i think , why .
this sentence from using <unk> lives from the idea that success or happiness depends on solving a challenge , without understanding the experience of the experience , as though my life would be so successful , because i could get the possible <unk> of a life of a prosthetic hand , or whatever people can perceive me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re shaped by the challenge , whether it &apos;s physically , emotional or even two .
and i claim that that &apos;s good .
<unk> are not an obstacle that we have to have to be <unk> to get better with our lives .
<unk> are just to our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> than my shadow .
sometimes i realize that it &apos;s very present , sometimes it &apos;s not to see it , but it &apos;s constantly on me .
and i don &apos;t want the impact to do the <unk> of the <unk> of a human race .
there are in life in life and challenges , and those are just a real person , and each person goes with it , but the question is not whether we &apos;re going to be wrong with <unk> , or not , but how we relate to it .
so , we &apos;re not only responsible for people that we love to preserve before <unk> , but they &apos;re paying attention to get good with it .
and we don &apos;t like our children if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t adapt .
you &apos;ve got to separate two things , for one of the medical fact , to be an amputee , and to the other social argument about whether i &apos;m disabled or not .
and to be honest , the only true and sustained disability , which i had to put apart is that the world is constantly saying , they can describe me with these definitions .
in our desire to protect people that are at the heart , to give them the cold , hard truth about their medical orientation , or even a prediction to the quality of life that they expect , we have to pay for that we don &apos;t have to pay the consensus for somebody in fact .
perhaps the basic concept , which is just looking at what &apos;s broken in a broken , and how do we fix it , for each individual , as the moron .
if we treat a man not holistically , and not all its forces and opportunities and acknowledge , we can create in addition to the natural fight that you might have to lead , another disease .
we &apos;ve got a people who has value for our society .
so we have to look beyond the <unk> , and look at all the aspects of human possibilities .
but most importantly , it &apos;s between perception of our ingenuity and our great <unk> , a link .
we should not be <unk> , or <unk> , we should not try to avoid them , nor should we put them under the rug , but it &apos;s about discovering in the <unk> opportunities .
i may be more about that , realizing that we don &apos;t necessarily have to fix ourselves , but we &apos;re going to be able to put them open to the hug , to put them on the <unk> , to use a <unk> , and maybe even to dance with it .
and maybe we can do it , more than something natural and useful and useful to see and feel so much through their presence .
this year , we released the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he wrote about evolution 150 years ago , darwin , darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human character .
i would be doing this : not the most powerful of his species , and even the <unk> of his way , but the changing changes can change the best way of the best change in the best way of doing it . . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em changes .
from conflict creates creativity .
it &apos;s not just from darwin &apos;s , we know that the ability to survive and <unk> , from the struggle of the human spirit is to transform itself through conflicts .
so , again , change and adaptation are the greatest skills of humans .
and maybe we &apos;re only going to know what wood we are <unk> if we &apos;re really going to be <unk> .
perhaps that &apos;s the sense of <unk> , a perception of <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give ourselves something like this .
we can give real-time points a new meaning that &apos;s going beyond difficult times .
maybe we can see <unk> as a change .
<unk> are for a change that we haven &apos;t adapted yet .
i think the biggest damage we have had to do with ourselves is to think that we should be normal .
oh , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s the usual . it &apos;s not the normal . and would you really know these poor , gray person really want to know , if it really existed ?
i think that &apos;s not more .
it would be great if we had this paradigm of normality against another , or the strength , to put it even a little bit more dangerous , so we can use the forces of very many children , and invite them to have their very special and useful ability to engage in society .
in addition , we found that we were dealing with the members of our society : useful to be useful and afford a contribution .
there &apos;s evidence that the neanderthals in 60,000 years ago , older people have , and people with severe physical injuries , and that might have happened because the <unk> of these people are valuable for society : the society .
they didn &apos;t look at these people as broken and useless ; they were treated as something special and valuable .
a few years ago , i went in the city where i grew up in a <unk> in the <unk> in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was in front of a <unk> tomato .
it was summer , and i had <unk> .
and i hear like a guy behind me , &quot; if that &apos;s not a aimee mullins . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to go around and see that older man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i can &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t remember me .
when i first saw her , i took them out of the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , that .
and then , of course , it took click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i had only known from stories of my mother , because i was , of course , very typical , to my birthday &apos;s two weeks .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in the vacation , and so my parents had the man who brought me to the world , not .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet went to you , and i just had a few toes on that and a few toes on the other foot was the <unk> , that strangers had to be the bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you never walk , and never going to be as the person like other children or you could never have a independent lives , and since then , you &apos;ve never got me a independent life . &quot;
in fact , i found that he had collected my entire childhood , no matter if i didn &apos;t win at a <unk> in the second grade in the second grade , if i had been on the <unk> to <unk> , whether i was on the <unk> to <unk> , whether i had been my scholarship or one of my <unk> <unk> , and he used that <unk> to teach his students .
and he called this part of his <unk> x factor , the potential of human being .
you can &apos;t just emphasize enough how critical of these factor for quality of life can be of the human quality of life .
and dr. <unk> told him , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if you don &apos;t get something else , and if you &apos;re only going to get a little bit of a support , when you get kids yourself , kids can achieve a lot . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> has changed his thinking .
he understood that the medical diagnosis was diagnosis , and how someone would do it , two different things .
and i also changed my thinking over time when they asked me at 15 years old , if i &apos;d asked my prostheses against legs from meat and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i didn &apos;t want to be normal normally .
if you ask me that today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and that &apos;s because i &apos;ve had something with my legs , not even despite this experience .
and perhaps that change could happen , because i &apos;ve been so many people who opened me in doors , instead of people who were going to meet me , or i wanted to have a notion .
you see , it &apos;s really only one of the people who show them how they can rearrange their forces , and they &apos;re through .
if you allow you to activate your own , inner forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you can do that , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re opening a door , you &apos;re a very good teacher .
they bring them to open doors themselves .
the real meaning of the <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means something that is , you know , that in one , the potential is <unk> .
again , what potential would we want to do now ?
in the &apos; 60s , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , in the united states , in the united states , there were <unk> in <unk> .
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students will pass after grades .
and the a learner will become more efficient , the better teachers are going to get better teachers .
so , you &apos;ve got a <unk> period of time talking to a &quot; x &quot; the note &quot; very good , &quot; they said they were <unk> that they were very clever , and after those three months they really were writing .
and of course , it &apos;s going to be a heart attack that the heart stent was said to be told , it &apos;s only sufficient .
and then it was then the three months after the three months .
but only those who were still in school -- except from the students who were going to school .
and that trial was that teachers weren &apos;t <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something changed .
they were just told that they were the <unk> , and they were the students with the note of the grade , and as they were , they taught them something and treated them .
the only real disability is a mind that has broken , hasn &apos;t that hope has no more . it finds nothing more than it doesn &apos;t have our natural , <unk> <unk> , and our innate ability of imagination . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but if we can do it , to help the human mind , to hope itself and other people to find themselves as beautiful , and to be <unk> and <unk> , we actually put our forces in really positive .
when a spirit of these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i want to end with a poem that was written by a persian poet named <unk> in the 14 century , and my friend jacques <unk> told me , and the poem is called &quot; god who knows only four words . &quot; &quot; every child knows , not the god of the names , not the god of the name , not the god of the name , not the god of the names . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you very much .
how would you be better than you are right now ?
assuming i said that , through few changes of their genes , a better memory -- basic , more and faster .
or do you want to be <unk> , more powerful , more power .
would you want to be more attractive and more confident ?
how would it be to live longer in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of those who always have always been looking down for more creativity .
what would you like to do ?
which would you like to have , if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would like creativity ?
put your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you decide to do a good memory ?
there are a few more .
what about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to think of as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a completely different world .
is that all invisible ?
or is it possible ?
evolution has been an excellent issue here in the ted conference , but today i want to give you the idea of a doctor &apos;s view of the subject .
the great geneticist in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the russian orthodox church , once wrote a paper , with the title , &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those who doesn &apos;t mean evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time , you take your personal <unk> -- i give you the authorization -- and maybe you can take a look at kathryn <unk> &apos; book , which is that it &apos;s about being wrong , because nothing else is going to be wrong with you .
but if you accept biological evolution , you &apos;ll remember this : is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
is it possible for other people , or is it us ?
this is another view of the tree of life .
in this picture , i have a bush as a center of <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the edges of life , all existing <unk> on the tops of these twigs in evolutionary terms : you have survived ; it has survived its own <unk> and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , right at the end , is that , of course , what we &apos;re most interested in is most of .
we &apos;re passing from a common ancestry to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in that period , there were 20 or 25 different sets of cogs from hominids .
some are come and went .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years .
it seems like we &apos;re pretty remote from the other parts of the tree of life , but in fact , the basic mechanisms are our cells quite a second .
is it clear that we can use that to be able to use the mechanisms of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human error , which is used to treat the heart of the human genome project ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein , that &apos;s the same protein that comes out of the pancreas .
and as we speak about bacteria , you realize that each of us in our gut is more bacterial than it takes cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times as many times .
i mean , think when antonio damasio after your sense , think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm ; it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s wet , it &apos;s very convenient .
and you &apos;re going to give you all nutrients that you only wish to be able to do without any effort .
it &apos;s really a easier way of bacteria , with occasional <unk> of the shell , forced forced to <unk> .
but , you know , you have a wonderful environment for these bacteria , as well as you care about your life .
they help the <unk> of nutrients , and they protect them against specific diseases .
but what &apos;s going to come to the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> equilibrium in the form of a species ?
or are we something going to be something else -- something that might even be adapted to the environment ?
now , let &apos;s take a step back in time from 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four billion years ago -- maybe three to four billion years ago , the first <unk> organisms , maybe as much as a mass or a billion years , and then the human species , which in the last year <unk> years .
in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe , life on earth is just short , the animal kingdom , as a single individual , and the human life , a little <unk> .
we were .
this is also the <unk> of this talk , so i hope , d ace enjoyed you .
now , when i was a college student in college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by elegance and beauty of biology .
i fell into the power of evolution , and i found something very fundamental : in most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , each cell , and all the genetic information of the cell will run into both <unk> .
but at the time , as a bioluminescent organism began , things started to change .
older reproduction , reproduction .
and most importantly , with the introduction of sexual reproduction , which cuts the genome , is the rest of the body .
in fact , you could say that the death penalty death of death in evolution in evolution in evolution in evolution as well as sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , if i was a <unk> , i thought , okay , sex / death , death for sex -- it seemed quite bizarre at the time , but it was quite bizarre at the time , but it &apos;s been to my heart attack .
i &apos;ve come to understand the feelings of george burns that was in las vegas his show in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a pat in his <unk> .
he opens the door .
he &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and she says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wonderful , &quot; says george , &quot; i &apos;ll take the soup . &quot;
i came to the realization that i had a goal that was very different than the goal of evolution -- not very small , just different .
i &apos;ve tried to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep ourselves healthy .
i wanted to put health work on a disease .
i wanted us to live a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the <unk> of the genome to the next generation , adaptation and survival generation generation after generation .
from a evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i developed like <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage of orbit to drop out into the ocean .
i think we all would be able to understand the mindset , the woody of all the expression of the expression , when he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to get immortality through my work .
i want to do it by not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t necessarily mean the longest life .
it doesn &apos;t include the biggest ones , the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution <unk> the creatures that are best adapted to their environment .
it &apos;s just the test of survival and success .
on the ground of the ocean , bacteria are there that are <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be the hot steam , if fish were there , if fish were there , it would have been a <unk> environment to be able to do it .
so , what does that mean when we look at what &apos;s happening in evolution , how do we think about the space of people in evolution , and especially as we enter into the next phase , i would say that there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
the first one is we &apos;re not going to be present .
we &apos;ve reached a kind of balance .
and the reasons for doing that , we were able to get through medicine , we &apos;ve been able to preserve a lot of genes that have otherwise been <unk> , and we &apos;ve been away from the population .
and secondly , we as a species , we evolved our environment that we &apos;ve been able to adapt to ourselves , and we adapt to them , and we &apos;re going to adapt to them .
and by the way , we wander and circulate and <unk> us so much that they can &apos;t tell you that isolation is necessary , for evolution , for evolution .
a second possibility is that it &apos;s going to be a evolution of traditional ways , of course , of the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far as the isolation , if we colonize as a species distant planets , it will be distributed and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , a <unk> , fascinating and terrifying possibility .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just natural , but led to us as a symbol of us as the choices we do .
now how could this happen ?
how could it be that we do this ?
let &apos;s first look at the reality that the people today , in some cultures make decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not very good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so , if you think about it , if it &apos;s not only possible the gender of your child is going to be able to make genetic adaptations that would cure the disease and cause the disease .
what if they could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s disease or the benefits of fighting or <unk> ?
would you not want to make these changes in your genes ?
when we zoom in , these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible .
the human genome project began in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it cost $ billion dollars .
in the following year , when it was 2004 , they could do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can put a sequence of three billion base pairs of the human genome to a price of about 20,000 and in the space of about one week .
it &apos;s not going to take a long time to reality until reality is going to be the $ 1,000 human genome , and it will become increasingly available for everyone .
one week ago , the national academy of engineering , the national academy of engineering , and <unk> <unk> , two scientists , the independent process of evolution to work faster and to <unk> proteins in a more efficient manner -- which is called <unk> <unk> .
a few years ago , the <unk> of the scientist named <unk> wrote for his research in which he took a adult <unk> , and through the manipulation of only four genes , the cell , to turn them into a <unk> cell -- a cell potentially , to be able to be able to do any cell in your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that &apos;s produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just protection from itself , but also to the immunity of other viruses .
if you believe it or not , it &apos;s a experimental trial in walking living in the palm of the surface of a tomato soup .
can you imagine something good that comes from tobacco ?
this is all reality , and in the future , it &apos;s going to be much more possible .
now , imagine two other small changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change your cells ?
what if you could change the sperm and the <unk> , or the newly <unk> , to change your children a better chance of life -- eliminating the diabetes , aren &apos;t the risk of cancer ?
who doesn &apos;t want to teach kids ?
and then the optimistic technique , the same engine of science that can enable the changes to prevent disease , to prevent disease , we could also allow ourselves to <unk> , <unk> -- better memory .
why don &apos;t you have the <unk> of a ken <unk> , especially if you can augment it with the next generation of <unk> ?
why not have the fast <unk> that will allow them to run faster and longer ?
why no longer live ?
these are going to be <unk> .
and if we are at a place where we can pass it to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes that we want , we will be transformed by <unk> evolution to <unk> .
we &apos;re going to have a process that &apos;s potentially about 100,000 years , and we can compress it on a thousand years -- and maybe even the next 100 years .
these are choices with which their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have to be overcome .
do we have these decisions create a society that &apos;s better than the successful ones that is more successful ?
or are we going to selectively <unk> different attributes that we want to have for some of us , not for others of us ?
are we going to create a society that is <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions we have to be facing .
and most of all , we will ever be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom we &apos;re going to need to make these choices ?
in the good days , as you might think , as you might think , these choices are going to be decisions .
thank you .
i want you to think of yourself now , a portable robot that gives you a <unk> capabilities , or another , the <unk> , to go back and go back and go again .
at berkeley <unk> , these robots are called <unk> .
they &apos;re no different than something that they put in the morning and they give them extra strength , and that &apos;s going to increase their speed , and they &apos;re going to help them maintain their balance .
that &apos;s indeed the true nation-state of human and machine .
but not only that -- so merging and connect with the universe , and other devices are out there .
it &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
now , to show you what we &apos;re working on , we start talking about the american soldiers , which is about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the demand that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some significant complications -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- chronic <unk> .
so we thought we thought we would embrace this challenge and create a <unk> that would help deal with this problem .
so let me introduce you now to <unk> -- or the human universal <unk> .
lg : i can carry 200 pounds of <unk> terrain , for many hours .
the flexible design allows you to be able to do it , to recycle and highly <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do where i want to go and pull my strength and persistence .
we are far beyond our <unk> of this device , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s look at our view on the wheelchair , something that i &apos;m particularly passionate about .
there are 68 million people living in the world today .
that &apos;s roughly one percent of population .
and that &apos;s actually a conservative estimate .
we &apos;re often talking about very young individuals with spinal cord injury , which are in the <unk> of their lives -- wealth , &apos; 30s -- of the fate , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the population of population , whose number of spreads .
and so pretty much the only option -- if it &apos;s about a <unk> , or it &apos;s the wheelchair -- is the wheelchair .
and so it &apos;s been over 500 years since then , as i have to say , very successful introduction .
so we thought we could start writing a whole new chapter in mobility .
now , let me introduce you now to <unk> , which is carried by amanda <unk> , which has been <unk> 19 years ago , which is the result that they could not run for 19 years and now .
thank you .
as i said , amanda carries our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals <unk> on our <unk> , which is attached to your back attached .
here are also <unk> , the <unk> is on their hips , as well as to their <unk> that they &apos;re moving forward into this rather <unk> and very natural place .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as an <unk> <unk> during a <unk> <unk> .
in a fraction of a second , i lost every feeling , and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after that , a doctor gets into my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , you &apos;ll never go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s found every single person from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies have been doing it since then , to go back to <unk> , to climb again , and even driving the hands of the hands .
but nothing was invented that i &apos;d let myself go back until now .
thank you .
and as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet and discuss with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change life from future generations -- not just for the soldiers , or amanda here and all the wheelchair , but for everyone .
thank you .
at home in new york , i was ceo of a nonprofit organization called robin hood .
when i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a child soldier at a volunteer .
now , in our city , in the volunteers of volunteers , you have to be very early on the <unk> to be able to go through .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers on the <unk> , so i had pretty good opportunities .
but it was still a race against the other volunteers to reach the <unk> <unk> and figure out what our jobs would be .
when i found the <unk> , he was just in a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which was surely one of the worst days of her life .
it was right in the middle of the night , and she stood in the <unk> , and it was tucked under a screen outside of rain , living in flames , in flames .
the other volunteers who arrived in front of me -- let &apos;s call him <unk> luther -- got the <unk> as first , and was asked to go to the house and save the dog of the <unk> .
the dog ! i was in love with envy .
and there was any lawyer or <unk> , who now , for the rest of his life , could tell the people that he was in a <unk> house to save a living , only because he was five seconds faster than i was .
now , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; bing , you need to go to the house .
you have to go up and go to the fire over and over , and you have to get a pair of shoes . &quot;
i swear .
now , not exactly what i had hoped , but i went to go -- the stairs go up , the hallway on the <unk> <unk> , which was already done at that point , in the bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was wearing my prey back down , where i was at the front of my <unk> and the beloved dog .
we were carrying our treasures out to the <unk> , where , not surprising , his much more attention than mine .
and a few weeks later , the <unk> was a letter of the <unk> where she deals for the brave use of her house .
one of all the <unk> <unk> : someone had actually taken a pair of shoes .
so in my career in robin hood as well as a volunteer in my <unk> as a volunteer , i witnessed of generosity and darkness in the big scale , but i also see the benevolence and the <unk> of individuals .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , when i look at this room and look at people who are either going to succeed or give up on their way there , i would like to offer that memory : wait for that .
don &apos;t wait to make a difference in the life of someone else until you &apos;ve reached your first million .
if you give something to give , you &apos;re going to give it right now .
put them in a <unk> , they put a park in the neighborhood .
be a mentor .
not every day is going to give us a chance to save lives of a human , but every day gives us the opportunity to change one .
so put them on ; save the shoes .
thank you .
bruno <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i &apos;m just coming back from a community that knows the secret of the human race .
a place where women lead to the <unk> , with sex &apos; hi , and the game is determined -- where is a serious issue .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the world of congo .
bonobos are together with chimpanzees our nearest living relatives .
that means we have a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we have this aspect of <unk> in the narrative of human evolution .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
as chimpanzees as the chimpanzees of great , fear of <unk> were led by <unk> females .
it &apos;s really what came up with , because that &apos;s going to be an awful social society , in the deadly violence .
but unfortunately , bonobos tend to be familiar with the primates .
they live in the deep waters of the <unk> , and they &apos;re very hard to get rid of the observation .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of strategic biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the <unk> of a violent argument for decades , and nearly as many lives have seen as the first world war .
it &apos;s not surprising that these destruction also survive the bonobos .
<unk> and the decline of <unk> is that you can &apos;t even put a diagnosis with the winky dink bonobos -- and even there we are not secure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear that the trees hits .
who are these relative ?
we know them as &quot; love instead of war , because they have <unk> , or <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and the rules so conflict and social disparities .
i &apos;m not saying that that would be the answer to all humanitarian problems -- because life is more than the <unk> .
bonobos -- like humans -- love to play their lives .
music is not only <unk> .
and for us , it &apos;s fundamental to us , and the care of the tolerance , the care of the tolerance .
we learn to trust trust and the rules of the game .
but more sustainable creativity and resilience , and it &apos;s all about the creation of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections , diversity of connections . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and if you look at bonobos in the game , you see the evolutionary origins of human error , dance and rituals .
play is the <unk> that <unk> us .
now , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i &apos;d like to show you some unique footage straight out of the wild .
first of all , a vertical-takeoff aircraft on <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here &apos;s a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what she &apos;s doing .
that could be the evolutionary origin of , &quot; you get it to the eggs . &quot;
it &apos;s only that i think it like that , not true .
yes !
so <unk> are spread , both in bonobos as well as well .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows the <unk> that you bring new elements into play -- like the testicles -- and also how the game is both -- and also , as a game , as well as a game .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can take lots of forms of some of which some kind of quiet , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover that orientation again .
and i want to show you , that &apos;s <unk> , a young female , and she plays it with water .
i think , as you can play , we &apos;re sometimes alone , and we look at limitations of our inner and external worlds .
and it &apos;s this playful curiosity that allows us to explore and interact and interact , and the unexpected findings that we form are the actual breeding of creativity .
this is just a small <unk> on the insights , which is the bonobos to bring us into our past and present .
but they also true a mystery for our future , a future where we have to adapt to distributed societal challenges , through larger creativity and analytic units .
the secret is that the game is the key to these skills .
in other words , game is our <unk> .
to adapt to a more sustainable world , we have to play .
but are we going to do the best of our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s essential .
for bonobos and humans , life is not made of their teeth and claws .
now , if you look at it , if you seem to be a little bit , game seems to be on the <unk> .
and so , my favorite statistic , let &apos;s embrace this gift of evolution , and collectively play , as we teach creativity and the wonder of wonder .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two pairs , in particular 1979 , exactly the same day , in exactly the same moment , each <unk> a baby -- okay .
so two pairs , each <unk> a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to be able to imagine the <unk> , because if you look at all the time , you &apos;re not going to listen to me .
imagine that just for a moment .
and in this scenario , you can imagine that in a case , the headquarters is wearing a y <unk> , which is heading to the x chromosome of the surgeon .
and in the other case , the headquarters has a x chromosome that hits the x chromosome of the surgeon .
both of them are both <unk> , both <unk> .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people .
in most of my activities , i &apos;ve got two very hats .
under a hat , i was working with the history of anatomy .
i &apos;m an <unk> , and in this case , i study how people interacted with anatomy -- the human body , animal body -- how they were dealing with <unk> , with <unk> , <unk> , how they were thinking about body .
the other hat that i carried with my work is the activist , as an ecologist -- or , as i say , as i say , as the impatient -- of people who are patients who are patients .
in this case i &apos;ve been working with people , the <unk> , the social norms in question .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are <unk> twins , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve worked with people working with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than common .
and very often i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people whose gender is <unk> -- so people who don &apos;t have the average male or female <unk> .
and as a general term , we can use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;ll just give you a couple examples for the kinds of types of types that are not the male or female standard .
in one case , you might have seen somebody with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of the y <unk> , which is the <unk> that we &apos;re all about to do to testes , to testes .
and so , that &apos;s why the testicles on the <unk> stage testosterone .
but because this individual is missing the receptors to detect the testosterone , not the body , the body doesn &apos;t respond to testosterone .
and that &apos;s called <unk> .
so a lot of testosterone , but no reaction on it .
as a result , the body evolved to be more of the typical female trend .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s taken as a girl .
but it takes a lot of times until you reach the puberty and grow your breasts and evolve , but it doesn &apos;t get your period until somebody gets to that there is something different .
and they do a few tests and find out that instead of <unk> and spiritual , in fact , it carries a y chromosome .
and it &apos;s important to understand that you could actually hold this person in fact , but that &apos;s not really .
women , like men , have something in our bodies that you call <unk> .
they &apos;re in the posterior part of our body .
and the <unk> places , which are <unk> hormones .
most women , as i do -- i think a typical woman -- i don &apos;t know my actual <unk> , but i think i &apos;ve probably had the typical question -- most women like i actually talk to the <unk> .
we &apos;re producing <unk> , and we &apos;re talking to <unk> .
the consequence is that somebody like me actually has a brain that has been born as a woman who was born with balls , and a <unk> .
now , it &apos;s really complicated ; <unk> are not just in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some sense , you can be distributed across all the bandwidth .
another example : a few years ago i received the phone call of a 19 person who was born as a young boy , he had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , lived as a man , and he had just discovered that he had been slandered and a liberal .
he had a extreme shape of a natural <unk> .
it &apos;s got a <unk> chromosome , and in the womb , his <unk> were so strong that they were basically making a male <unk> .
and as a result , his own <unk> male burst , his brain was exposed to the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- no one knew anything .
and it was only when he became 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he found out that the physicians found that the physicians had found that he was in the inner economy .
okay , just a quick example of <unk> .
there are some people with <unk> chromosomes , creating something called the <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> .
we don &apos;t know exactly why this happens .
so gender can occur in many different varieties .
the reason why kids do with this kind of body -- it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> twins , it &apos;s spiny -- from surgeons often to the norm , isn &apos;t that because this is their physical health .
in many cases , these people are totally healthy .
the reason you &apos;re doing to you is , you &apos;re going to be doing different kinds of surgical surgeries , because it converts our social categories .
so our system is based on the idea that a particular person has a specific identity with a particular identity .
so , we have the concept that a woman is to have a female identity , a black person , says , means to have an african anatomy in terms of its own history . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
so we have this awful memorable idea .
and when we &apos;re faced with a body that is actually kind of a different way , we &apos;re confused that into this <unk> .
so in our culture , we have a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation really is based on a very romantic concept .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born , the two people are in a body .
where i had heard most of the time in the last time most of the time was the <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , whose gender had been asked to be in the <unk> world in berlin &apos;s question . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
many journalists call me the question of , &quot; what are you going to do with the question that tells us if <unk> female is female female or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalist that there &apos;s no one .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to admit that nature gives no line between male and female , or the male and <unk> and female and <unk> ; <unk> , we are that that &apos;s the case of course .
so we &apos;ve got a situation where we have , we &apos;ve got to be on our science , we have to redefine ourselves that these categories that we kept categories that we kept categories of <unk> categories to create permanent <unk> , much more <unk> than we &apos;ve accepted .
and that &apos;s not only in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also true in race , which is a much more complicated than ours has been allowed to do .
we &apos;re going to go through all sorts of different backgrounds .
we look at the fact that we have at least 95 percent of our dna in common .
what should we start with the fact that we &apos;re only going to distinguish ourselves from a few <unk> ?
as we continue to move our science forward , we &apos;re going to get increasingly into an area of the <unk> , where we have to acknowledge that the <unk> categories we have had are probably too simple .
we see that in all sorts of different backgrounds of human life .
one of the areas we &apos;re seeing to see in our today today , in the united states today , are the struggles over the beginning and the end of life .
we have difficult conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body to people , so he &apos;s got another right as the symbol of life .
we have very difficult hiv -- perhaps not as public as in medicine -- about the question of when someone is dead .
our ancestors had never been that hard to fight with the question , when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve got somebody under the nose , and when they moved , they haven &apos;t buried them yet .
if you weren &apos;t moving , you &apos;ve buried it .
but today , we are now in a situation where we take people out of <unk> organs and they want to give them to other people .
and as a result , we asked ourselves to the fight with the really tough question , when someone &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really hard place that we don &apos;t have as simple categories as we used to do .
now , you might think that the whole section of categories someone would be really happy to make me happy .
i &apos;m political <unk> , i <unk> people with infinite bodies , but i have to admit , it &apos;s going to make me nervous .
realizing that these categories are really more insecure than we thought , making sure .
and it drives me in terms of terms of terms of the democracy .
so , to tell you about this <unk> , i have to first find that i &apos;m a big fan of founding founding .
i know they were <unk> , i know they were <unk> , but they were great .
i found that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical where what they did was that i &apos;m going to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of the music that is absolutely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what &apos;s going on with the <unk> .
the founding fathers came out of my view of <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
what she was doing was a <unk> concept , and she used it through another , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and as you all remember , our founding fathers took the concept of monarchy , and monarchy , in a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the masters of the ancient world had no concept based on the dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of white blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power to have these political power , because of the <unk> <unk> from the grandfather to the father to the son and so on .
the founding cloud combines this idea , and it &apos;s coming through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all human beings were created .
it <unk> that video , and they decided that <unk> , the similarities , not the differences , and that was very radical .
now , they were part of it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things in common .
the democracy grew up , but the same time grew up in the same time .
when you look at the history of the founding , it &apos;s very clear that many of you have been interested in science , and you &apos;ve been interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went away from geography <unk> , and things like a supernatural concept of power , back , where the transmission is based on a very <unk> conception of <unk> .
she moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the reception studies , they talk about nature and the god of nature .
they &apos;re not talking about god and nature .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of that , she was able to give us a concept that was <unk> by <unk> &apos;s unique . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and in fact , you &apos;ve got a very wonderful way for the future civil rights movement .
they didn &apos;t think like that , but what they did for us was great .
so what happened after that ?
for instance , for example , women who <unk> the concept , the concept of finance , which says that modernization is more important than the anatomical difference , and said , &quot; we have an spiritual and <unk> than difference is not significant enough that we should not have the capacity to have the law , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women <unk> that successfully .
next came to the successful civil society , where we saw people like <unk> <unk> , who wrote about it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we &apos;re finding men in the <unk> rows of <unk> who say , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people of different skin cells that are rooted in <unk> constraints , again , successful .
we &apos;re seeing the same with the <unk> .
and of course , the problem is that , as we start to look at all of the similarities , we have to start asking the question of why we sustain certain problems .
now , suppose i want to maintain particular <unk> , in our culture , in our culture .
i don &apos;t want to give a fish for example the same rights as a person .
i don &apos;t want to say that we should be taking away from the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> should be right to give their provoke to sex or to marry .
so there are some anatomic <unk> , which make sense for me , and that , i think , should retain .
but the challenge is to try and figure out which it are and why we keep them out and whether they are meaningful .
so let &apos;s bring back to these two creatures that have been <unk> at the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both of the middle classes on the exact same day .
let &apos;s imagine that one of them , maria , three months <unk> was born , so it &apos;s been born on june 1 .
headline , on the other hand , it &apos;s born to be born on a tuesday morning , so it &apos;s been born at the end of a march .
only because of the fact that maria three months was born , you get all kinds of right three months before <unk> -- the right to have the right to have the right to drink the right to drink .
rabin has to wait for all this , not because it &apos;s actually a different old age , only because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re finding other forms of what your rights are .
<unk> , because you accept that it &apos;s male -- even though i didn &apos;t tell you that it &apos;s the <unk> -- since you accept that it &apos;s male , it can now be dragged , which gps doesn &apos;t have to worry about .
maria <unk> , can &apos;t be seen in all states of the same law , which is the red in all states , and that &apos;s the right to marry .
hacker can marry a woman in each state , but maria can only marry a woman in a few states .
so we have these sustained <unk> categories that are problematic in many ways that are problematic and questionable .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do because our science makes such progress in the realm that we have to admit that there &apos;s a democracy that &apos;s based on anatomy , ?
i don &apos;t want to give science to science , but at the same time it feels like the science of science is going to be durable .
so where do we go ?
it seems like our culture seems a kind of pragmatic posture : &quot; good , we have to pull somewhere in somewhere , so we pull them somewhere . &quot;
but a lot of people doodle in a very strange position .
so , for instance , texas at a point decided to marry a man that you didn &apos;t have a y chromosome to marry a woman , means that you have a y chromosome .
now , in practice , people are not tested to their hands .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story that i told you about the <unk> .
when we look at one of the modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he offers us in his &quot; i have a dream speak , &quot; a kind of solution .
he said we should not be talking about people , but by the nature of their character , &quot; judge , and about anatomy .
and i &apos;d like to say , &quot; well , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you look at people because of their <unk> ?
i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we should spread right in people &apos;s rights , because i have to admit that i have a series of golden <unk> that might prefer to deserve a little bit more than some people i know .
i want to suggest that i probably know some of the bright <unk> that are <unk> , more elegant and more flexible choices to meet their sexual relationships as some of the <unk> that i know .
so how do we make the question of the character of the character ?
it turns out to be a really hard time .
and part of me says , what if the contents of a personality would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- using fmri visible ?
do we really go to that direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we go .
what i know is that it &apos;s really important to think about the idea that the united states is shaking in it , thinking about questions of democracy .
in our efforts to democracy , we &apos;ve done really well in our business , and i think we would do a good thing in the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , in iran , where a man sitting sexually attracted to other men &apos;s disease , being punished with death , unless he &apos;s prepared to acquire a <unk> , in which case it &apos;s going to be alive .
so that species doesn &apos;t exist .
i &apos;m happy to say that we didn &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon that i spoke a few years ago with a few <unk> twins to separate them , to separate them , to make a name .
but when i was dealing with him , and he asked why he made these interventions -- it was highly <unk> surgeries -- his response that in his country , these kids would be very poorly treated , and that &apos;s why he had to do it .
i told him , &quot; well , you &apos;ve got political constraints in achieving instead of a surgery to separate them ? &quot;
the united states are offering incredible opportunities to allow people to be the ones that they are , without having to change the state of the nation . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
that &apos;s why i think we have to be surprised .
all right , just to wrap up , i want to realize that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i &apos;d like to think about the possibility of how democracy might look like , or have looked , if we had more involved in that .
and i want to say something that is a feminist a feminist , and i think there might be different kinds of insights based upon various types of anatomy , <unk> when people apply a <unk> .
since i was interested in years , since i was interested in <unk> , i was interested in research in research .
and one of the things that i really found really interesting is the difference between men and women in ways that you think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , on average -- not every , but on average -- more , more complex social relationships and the care for people who are vulnerable within the group , to give a lot of attention .
and so , if we think about it , we have an interesting situation in front of us .
years ago , when i took a graduate student , one of my <unk> , which was my interest of feminism -- i looked at myself as feminist , so it &apos;s still -- a really clever question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s going on on feminism . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , that &apos;s the <unk> question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s about stereotypes about gender , so on feminism is not female .
but the more i thought about his question , i thought that there could be something <unk> in lifestyle .
that is to say that there could be something , in the average , which is what &apos;s going to tell us about <unk> social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> .
so where the founding fathers could be extreme , how individuals could be protected before the state , is it possible that if we put more moms into this concept , we &apos;re more a concept , not just how you preserve , but how do we care for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we need to go in the future when we &apos;re dealing with democracy about anatomy <unk> -- less about the individual body of thinking about the individual body , and to think more about relationships .
so , if we &apos;re trying to make a more sustainable compound , we can think about what we can do to each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m a <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you what i &apos;m going to do , i &apos;m going to make a very public confession , and that &apos;s : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love to give you any opportunity to find a different kind of outfit , to be able to have , and to be able to get too blogging and to get married .
but i don &apos;t buy anything new .
i get all my clothes from second hand on <unk> and in <unk> .
ooh , thank you very much .
<unk> allows me to reduce the impact of my <unk> on the environment and on my purse .
i meet all kinds of great people , my dollars , for usually a good focus ; i look pretty unique ; and it makes to my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what will i find today ?
will it have my height ?
do i like the color ?
will it cost less than 20 dollars ?
when all the answers are , i feel like i didn &apos;t win .
i &apos;d come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i showed up for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven couple of years , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for just one week , everything i did in my suitcase .
i have estimated that i &apos;m going to have anything else that i might want to wear , if i go to palm springs .
and since you weren &apos;t heard of me than the woman who &apos;s here at ted in your underwear , it &apos;s called that i found a couple of things .
and i &apos;d like to show you my baseline for this week .
does that good ?
while i do that , i &apos;m also going to give you some of the lessons i &apos;m whether you believe it or not , from those <unk> , not to have anything new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call that the lower tiger .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost be great for less than 50 dollars .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , has 55 me 55 , and it was the most expensive piece that i carried in this whole week .
dave : color is something powerful .
it &apos;s almost impossible to be bad , if you &apos;re wearing pants pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you get other happy people .
tuesday : nevertheless , it &apos;s totally <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life , trying to be myself and to fit at the same time .
be just who you are .
when you surround the right people , you &apos;re not going to be able to understand it , you &apos;re going to appreciate it .
wednesday : welcome your inner child .
sometimes people tell me , i looked like i was doing &quot; blink &apos; games , or i could remember them .
i &apos;d like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot;
heather : self-confidence is the key .
if you think you &apos;re going to look into something good , it &apos;s almost secure .
and if you think you don &apos;t look good , you &apos;re probably right , you &apos;re probably right .
i grew up with a mom who taught me the day for day .
but only when i got 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to wrap it briefly for you .
if you believe that you are inside and there &apos;s a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse here in this audience .
we should be able to do everything we want .
thank you .
dh : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> fit to everything .
and finally , saturday : one of the unique , unique , personal style is a great way to tell the world something about one , without having to tell a word .
it was kept me once again , when this week came to me , just because of what i was wearing . and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to fit all of my tiny suitcase .
so , before i go home , i &apos;m going to do it again .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay to let go .
i don &apos;t have to <unk> these things , because just about the corner , it &apos;s always going to be a different cold , <unk> , <unk> outfit , just waiting for me , if i love a little love in the heart and it &apos;s looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody combined .
i have something i &apos;d like to show you .
think of this as an <unk> , as flying as flying .
that &apos;s what we call our lab , <unk> design .
so let me tell you a little bit about that .
now , if you take this picture -- i &apos;m initially italian , and every boy in italy grows with this image in its room , but the reason i &apos;m showing you this is what i &apos;m showing you that in the previous decades , something very interesting happened .
so a few days ago , when you wanted to win a formula , they took their budget and put money on a good driver and a good car .
and when the car and the driver was good enough , they won the races .
now , these days , if you want to win a race , something like this here -- something that is the car in real time , a few thousand sensors , the information from the car , put that information into the system , and then use it to bring things back to the system , and then use it to bring things in real time .
this is what they would call , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s made of two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
now , what &apos;s interesting about today is the main idea in our lives .
our cities , in the last few years , has been working with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to computer computers .
and as a computer in the free , they start to respond in other ways , they will be perceived and driven .
when we <unk> cities , this is actually a big thing .
and by the way , i want to mention that cities are only two percent of the world &apos;s land , but 50 percent of the world &apos;s population is living there .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the carbon dioxide -- cause until 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , this is a big thing .
beyond the cities , pulling all this complexity and it &apos;s going to be in these objects of everyday life .
this is from an exhibition that was paola antonelli for moma later in the year , in the summer , organized .
it &apos;s called &quot; with me . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , we start to talk to ourselves .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost like every atom there is coming out there , a sensor and a <unk> .
and that &apos;s radically changing the interaction that we have with our environment .
in a sense , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of michelangelo ...
you know , when michelangelo shaped his moses , it says that he would take the hammer and put him on the end of his hammer -- actually , you can see a little bit of <unk> -- and said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you don &apos;t get ? &quot;
now , today , our environment starts for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m going to show you just a few examples -- again , with the idea of our environment and power .
let &apos;s start with the sound .
now the first project i &apos;d like to show you is actually one of the first of our labs .
it happened four years ago in italy .
and what we did there was actually a new kind of network that was used all over the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and authoritarian and <unk> information from this network that will be collected by the operators to understand how the city works .
the summer was a happy summer -- in 2006 .
it was like the <unk> won .
now , some of you will remember it was a italy against france , and then at the end of <unk> , the <unk> .
and no matter , italy have won by the end .
now look at what happened on this day , just observing the activity of the activity that &apos;s going on in the network .
this is the city .
you see in the middle , the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
on the morning , before the game .
you see the timeline .
in afternoon , people here , and there , the calls are going to be moving and moving .
the game starts -- silence .
sun makes a gate . italy is a gate .
<unk> people make a short call , go to toilet .
second <unk> , at the end of the normal <unk> .
first of all , second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
no one wins . yeah .
now , in that night , everyone went to the center to celebrate .
they saw the big rash .
the next day , everyone went to the center to meet the <unk> and the prime minister .
and then everyone went down .
you can see the image of the living self-portrait <unk> , where , since the most of the time , people are going to celebrate -- to have a great party , and they &apos;ll see the last speaker at the end of the day .
now , this is just one example of how we can feel the city , in a way , as we can &apos;t do it a few years ago .
so even quick example of feeling : this is not about people , but it &apos;s about things we use and consume .
now , today , we know all about where our stuff comes from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we only know about where things go .
so in this project , we &apos;ve designed a few little markers to track the trash as it goes through the system .
so we &apos;ve started with a few volunteers who have helped us before a year ago , in seattle , the things that they have -- different kinds of things , as you can see -- things that they could see .
then we have the little chips , the little brands , in the trash , and we started tracking it .
here are the results we have right now .
seattle ...
after a week .
with this information we realized that there &apos;s a lot of fishing fleets in the system .
we can actually do the same things in fact with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but that &apos;s a lot of <unk> <unk> and more complicated things .
but the other thing is , we believe that when we see every day that the cup that we throw away , it &apos;s not just going to be anywhere on the planet .
and the plastic we &apos;re still daily away every day .
and if we were going to show that to people , then we can change behavior .
so this is the reason for this project .
now , my colleague at mit , <unk> <unk> , could tell you a lot more about the perceive and the many other amazing things that you can do with , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we thought about at the beginning , and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we did a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question that came to us and said that spain and <unk> have a beautiful tradition to use in public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you make technology , new technology with it ?
and one of the ideas which were at mit in a <unk> <unk> , and they &apos;d be able to look at these tubes , and valves , <unk> , valves that open and closing .
it &apos;s going to be like a <unk> with <unk> of water .
when these sailors vary , they can write on it , they can write patterns , images , text .
and you can look at it , and it &apos;s open to leave you with you , as you can see on this picture .
well , we &apos;ve exhibited the mayor .
it really enjoyed him .
and we got the assignment to design a building of the expo .
we called it the digital water .
the whole building was made of water .
there &apos;s no doors or windows , but if you look at it , it will open and put it in .
the roof was covered with water .
and when it &apos;s forgiveness , if you want to reduce the syringes , you can even turn off the roof .
or they could conclude the building , and it &apos;s going to be the whole architecture , as in this case , you know , when you put the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve got the building . &quot;
no , you haven &apos;t destroyed the building , it &apos;s just that architecture almost disappears .
this is how the building works .
you see the person who asks what &apos;s going on inside .
and here you see me when i was trying to test the sensors that opened the water , not wet .
now , i should tell you what &apos;s going to happen at night than all of the sensors .
but in fact , it was even more important .
all the kids from <unk> came to the building , because the way it was playing with the building was very different .
no longer a building that would open up to make you a building , but a building that was still rising and holes in the water , you had to jump to be jumping without wet .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we always think about how people are using things that we design .
but reality is always unpredictable .
and that &apos;s the beautiful thing about creating things that are going to be used and interact with people .
so here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the projections on it .
and this is what &apos;s going on to us about the project project i &apos;m showing you now .
so , imagine that <unk> could really start to fly .
imagine you could have little helicopters that fly through the air , and each of you with a little <unk> light with <unk> light -- almost like a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a helicopter , like the you &apos;ve seen before , with other moves , completely synchrony .
you can have these cloud .
you can have a kind of coherent screen or display , like this -- a smooth formation in two dimensions .
or , you know , in three dimensions , where what changes is changing , the light is not the position of the fittest .
they can play with different ways .
imagine the screen could just be in different <unk> or sizes , in different ways .
but then , it could only be a 3d cloud of plastic debris that you can go and be able to look through them that you can look at from many , many different directions .
and you can see here a real <unk> , the <unk> to form a <unk> <unk> .
when you turn the light , it looks like this . so , as we saw it before .
imagine that every single person &apos;s going to be controlled by people .
it could be every single password , which is coming from people , from the movements of humans or so .
i &apos;d like to show you something here .
we &apos;ve worked with <unk> <unk> , one of the most famous <unk> of our time -- the <unk> on the metropolitan theater in new york and the <unk> in milan -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d analysis to use them as a <unk> for the <unk> .
here you can see <unk> dancing .
on the left hand , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> sensations .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> .
that &apos;s how they can relate to the entire movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , once we have all the <unk> , they can play with it and play with color moving and <unk> .
that &apos;s what we want to do as a possible pulse for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something we &apos;re working on for the olympics in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
now , the idea is , imagine what we &apos;re dealing with to do with , to do something and change the environment -- almost as we call it , as we call it , as we call a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everyone can give a little balls for a <unk> .
i think that the remarkable last decades , the last decades , is that we &apos;re changing from an embryonic world to a digital world .
it has all digitized , knowledge , and power it through the internet .
today , for the first time -- and the campaign obama has shown that -- can we get from the digital world of networks to the physical world of networks to the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to design and create a symbol .
that means something that is built in the city .
but tomorrow can it take us to the coming challenges -- think about climate change , or the co2 emissions -- how can we change from the digital world to the physical .
so the idea is that we actually are dealing with the people in which they are doing things together .
the cloud is again a cloud of <unk> , in the same way as one cloud of a cloud .
and these haze particles are water , whereas our cloud is a cloud from <unk> .
it &apos;s an extraordinary character in london , but it &apos;s covered with <unk> .
you can move inside the inside and make different types of experiences .
you can actually look at it from below the most important moments of melting of 2012 and neuroscience , and use it as a kind of connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky and something at the top you can go , like this new <unk> .
they can go .
and a kind of digital <unk> in the night -- but as an ecologist , a new kind of experience for all that want to go to the top .
thank you .
as an artist , the context is very important .
through my work , i try to express that people are not separate from nature and all connected to each other .
the first time i was in antarctica , i was in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
it &apos;s called awe awe .
my heart sank , i was <unk> , while i was trying to conceive of what i was in front of me .
the <unk> around me approximately 60 meters from the water , and i could only wonder that this was a snowflake on another snowflake , year after year .
and so , born is born as a calf , or by making it out of <unk> .
each <unk> has his own individual personality .
they interact with their environment and their experiences .
some people rebel and wake up to the bitter end , whereas others can &apos;t be able to withstand and in a canadian physical passion .
when you look at one iceberg , you think that you &apos;re isolated , apart and alone , just as we humans see people .
but the truth is far away .
as a researcher melts , i got rid of his <unk> atmosphere .
as the iceberg melts , he <unk> <unk> freshwater , which feeds a lot of life .
i &apos;m going to go to my shots of this cartoon , as i would do portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness that they exist in these individual moments , and never going to exist again .
it &apos;s not a death when you melt ; it &apos;s not a end , but it &apos;s a <unk> of your <unk> along the life cycle .
part of the ice in the <unk> that i &apos;ve got <unk> is very young -- a thousand years old .
and part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
and the last pictures i &apos;d like to show you is a iceberg that i put in <unk> in greenland .
rarely , you &apos;re actually witnessing a <unk> iceberg .
so here you see it now .
on the left , you see a little boat .
that &apos;s about five meters long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s located on the ground .
you can see here , it begins to rollers , and the boat has moved on to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
it &apos;s about 120 feet of water , or 40 meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , it shows you the following one other side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really quite blessed by the work of some amazing projects .
but the coolest thing i &apos;ve ever worked on was this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading commanders of the 1980s .
then one day , he came back from running back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs . &quot;
and that was the outbreak of this .
<unk> is completely paralyzed .
it can only use his eyes .
i was to him .
i have a company that &apos;s design and animation power , so that &apos;s a complex part of what we admire in the world and look at it .
so we decided to put tony -- <unk> -- and to support it .
i met with his father and his brother and his brother and he said , &quot; we will give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to talk to him , and i said , &quot; wait a minute , i didn &apos;t know -- i saw stephen hawking -- can &apos;t be able to communicate all the paralyzed people using these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only when you hear about higher and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
ordinary people are not available for these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you communicate ? &quot;
anyone ever seen the film &apos; film and <unk> ?
so you communicate -- that &apos;s how you walk your fingers along .
i said , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just a check , and instead , i had a check that i didn &apos;t know how to make it <unk> .
i was moving to the place of his brother , and his father and his father -- with the words , &quot; good , my suggestion is this : tony will talk , we &apos;re going to get him a device , and we &apos;re going to find a way to get through his art .
because it &apos;s a farce that you have to carry all that in your gut , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i was talking to a few months later .
i met these people from <unk> , a <unk> lab lab , and they have a technology that allows them to put a light on each surface to each surface , and then to draw on it , which only matches the negative area .
so they &apos;re moving around and they make <unk> like this .
they say all the things that are being put up there , a life cycle .
it begins with the testes , and then the <unk> , the <unk> , and the last one , are actually doing art .
but there was always a life cycle in her presentations .
so , i went home and ate with my wife and told her about everything , and we thought , &quot; well , second time , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use to control your eyes to taxes things , then we should find a way that <unk> can control a laser , so that it can make a <unk> .
that was the beginning of the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we have achieved a few things .
first of all , we have the insurance <unk> the doors , and we actually have a device to communicate with it -- an stephen <unk> .
that was incredible .
and it &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk about it , or you get an email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and then we have seven programmers from all over the world -- literally from all over the world -- to us .
my wife , my children , and i pulled into the garage , and these hacker and programmers and <unk> and <unk> have taken our house .
many of our friends thought we were beautiful stupid to do that , and we were <unk> and all the images on the walls would be <unk> .
but for over two weeks , we have programmed that , we went to the <unk> in venice , my children , and we created this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is an extraordinary regularity that we bought at the <unk> of venice , something <unk> and a few things from the <unk> and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , put it on a <unk> , and now we have a device that has access to us -- you can build it yourself , we put the code for free , the software for free , the software , you can download for free .
so we created a device that is completely devoid of limitations .
no insurance can <unk> .
it &apos;s not a hospital .
all of them can actually communicate with his eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of two weeks , we went back into <unk> room .
i love this picture , because it &apos;s the room from somebody else , and that &apos;s his room .
there &apos;s all of these <unk> in front of the great unveiling .
and after a year of planning , two weeks ago , <unk> and <unk> nights , drew for the first time after seven years .
and that &apos;s an amazing picture because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking beyond his life cycle .
we have released his bed , so that it can look outside .
we have a projector tube against a wall of the hospital in front of the hospital .
and he &apos;d been sending back for the first time , in his family &apos;s family and friends , and you can only imagine what a feeling that was on the parking lot .
we also had to put in the parking lot in the parking lot , so we felt ourselves as a part of the <unk> .
by the end , he &apos;s going to give us an email with the supreme content : &quot; for the first time for seven years , i &apos;ve created something .
i felt that i was running underwater , and i finally got to go down and down my head , so that i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that fair ?
that &apos;s kind of like our <unk> .
that keeps us to the <unk> , and we continue to continue .
and we &apos;ve got to make a lot of things in this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it &apos;s a <unk> right there .
and someone that has a <unk> potential , deserves so much more .
so what we &apos;re doing is to figure out how to do better , faster and stronger .
since that time we &apos;ve got all sorts of recognition .
we won a few awards .
if you think it &apos;s free , no one &apos;s earned about it .
it &apos;s all from our own pockets .
so , the awards were , &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
armstrong <unk> about us , and then in december , it &apos;s been honored , as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010 , which was really neat .
the beauty of this is -- and that includes the whole circle -- that it &apos;s this april , at the <unk> <unk> in the downtown of los angeles a exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> &quot; of the <unk> . &quot;
and there might be pretty much the toughest advocates of the <unk> <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
it &apos;s going to be part of the show , which is quite <unk> .
so basically , what i &apos;m about to do is , if you look at something that &apos;s impossible , then you can do it .
all in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , the <unk> -- anything was impossible .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and i had never had anything to do with <unk> , but i just pulled something through and with amazing people , so that we could put together something on the legs .
and that question was , any of you should be asking for every single day where you have to make something that &apos;s going to be done , if not now , when do you go ? and if i don &apos;t , who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and probably the most general <unk> <unk> .
and i always tell people that i don &apos;t want to get to a scientist .
you can have me as a farmer , or in leather , but nobody ever voted farmer .
today i want to tell you about circles and i tell you about circles .
now , a enlightenment is something that you &apos;ll find is something you &apos;re going to fall down somewhere .
you go to the block and take it as a revelation .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends did it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle of which i want to tell you today .
my circle came in the &apos; 60s at high school in <unk> , ohio , where i was the <unk> .
i was the one that every week in the <unk> of green and blue had been beaten until a teacher had saved my life .
she saved my life by letting me use the toilet in the <unk> .
they did it .
she did it for three years .
and i had to go out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and i found myself in san francisco -- i found a lover -- and i found it in the &apos; 80s , and i found it in the &apos; 80s .
about three or four years ago , i got a phone call in the middle of that teacher , ms. post , who said , &quot; i have to see you .
i &apos;m sad that we never know each other as adults .
can you please come to ohio , and please come together with the man i know you &apos;ve found it .
and i should say that i &apos;ve got <unk> , and i want you to go back . &quot;
so the next day we were in cleveland .
we looked at them , we were laughing , we thought , and we knew they needed to be in a hospice .
we found one for them , we took them , and we went around it , and we gave them eight , because it was necessary .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman i wanted to know as adults , i met met myself , turned it into a box full of ink and got stuck in my hands .
what happened was that the circle had closed , it was a circle -- and the revelation that i &apos;ve been talking about .
the revelation is that death is part of the life .
she &apos;s saved my life , and my partner and i &apos;m saving her .
and you know , this part of life takes all the rest of the rest of life .
it takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is what &apos;s going to be described here today .
it takes the same -- it would need , love and pleasure . and it &apos;s to us to give these things .
thank you .
imagine a large blast , as you go to 1,000 meters .
imagine an airplane full of smoke .
imagine a solar system , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds fear .
now , i had a unique place on that day ; i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only one who could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at her right , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve got a few birds . &quot;
the pilot had already reclaimed the machine , and we weren &apos;t so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot <unk> the machine after the hudson river .
it &apos;s not usually the route .
he &apos;s turning the engines down .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> to your <unk> &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk to the <unk> .
i was able to see it in her eyes , and she was horror , that life was too late .
i &apos;d like to tell you three things that i learned about myself that day .
i learned that in a moment .
we have these <unk> , we have these things we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to do a hand and didn &apos;t do it , all the fences i wanted to do , and i never made it .
while i was thinking about it , a gentleman i thought to myself , which is , &quot; i &apos;m bad wines . &quot;
because when the wine is there , and the person is there , i open him .
i never want to change anything in life .
and that urgency , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing that i learned about this day -- and that was when we got the george washington bridge , pretty much about <unk> -- i thought , gee , there &apos;s one thing that i really adore .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity , and with my errors , i &apos;m going to get better to become better in everything i have .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve given my ego to my ego .
and i &apos;ve got the time that i wasted for most of <unk> things , with people who mean something .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to climb negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have my wife for two years with my wife .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to have any of that ; i &apos;m going to be happy to be happy .
the third thing i learned -- and while the interior watch <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> into the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want that thing into 20 parts of how you know it from documentaries .
as we were in , i had this feeling , man , man , to die .
it &apos;s almost like we prepare for our lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and these sadness <unk> really in a thought , which is that i just wish to give myself one thing .
i just wish i could see my children .
so a month after that , i went to my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
let &apos;s not .
and i <unk> , i missed like a little child .
and in the world , everything was a sense of me .
i realized that when i told the dots that it was only about being a great father .
more than anything , everything else , is my only purpose in life , a good father .
i got the miracle that i didn &apos;t get to die on that day .
i got another gift , which is to see the future and live and live .
now , my call to everybody who &apos;s flying today is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but ask yourself , and how would you change ?
what would you do about it , because you think you &apos;re going to be there forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything , you &apos;re the best parents you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is quite simple .
we don &apos;t want iran to build the bomb .
the most important post there for the development of nuclear weapons is the <unk> in <unk> .
the gray boxes you see here , they &apos;re <unk> .
now , if we &apos;re going to work with the systems that are <unk> and valves , we can actually address a lot of problems with the centrifuge .
these gray boxes don &apos;t run with <unk> ; they &apos;re based on a completely different technology .
but if we can do it that an effective <unk> on a laptop <unk> , it &apos;s used by a <unk> , to <unk> these gray box , we &apos;re in business .
and that &apos;s the planning behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> are converted into the gray box , <unk> the centrifuge and the iranian <unk> -- it &apos;s accomplished accomplished .
that &apos;s a <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started rubbing our research on six months ago , completely unknown , what the purpose and purpose was this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very , very complicated , which is the most <unk> part , it made up of <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed a little bit <unk> , with these gray boxes , these <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> of our attention , and we started a project project , where we were our environment with <unk> , and studying this .
and then something funny happened .
<unk> <unk> looks like a <unk> that didn &apos;t liked the cheese -- <unk> , but he didn &apos;t want to eat him .
that didn &apos;t make sense in my eyes .
and after we were experimenting with different types of cheese , i realized that this is a <unk> attack .
it &apos;s a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> active in the gray box , when a special configuration has been discovered , even if the particular program , which is trying to attack it , it &apos;s going to be trying on that goal .
and if you don &apos;t , you don &apos;t do anything .
so , this is really my interest and we started working with it , almost around the clock , because i thought , well , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
it could say , for example , a national american power station , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be trying to figure out what the goal is .
so , <unk> , we <unk> the <unk> code , and found that it &apos;s in two digital warheads -- a smaller and a bigger one .
and we also realized that they were constructed very professional , by people who obviously had all of the information information .
she knew all bits of bits and <unk> she had to attack .
it actually probably known the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already garnered that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and high-tech , let me tell you , the <unk> are a science for yourself .
it &apos;s much more than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we &apos;re talking about -- about 15,000 lines of code .
it &apos;s kind of like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to get out of this code .
so what we thought was the first thing we were looking for was <unk> <unk> , because we know what that is .
and then we looked for <unk> and <unk> and trying to bring those with the physical world -- with potential goals in the real world .
so we needed theories about these targets that we could study or <unk> .
now , to put that theories , let &apos;s imagine that it &apos;s definitely <unk> , it needs to be a <unk> goal , and very likely to be in iran because there are most infections where most of the infections have been reported .
now , in this territory , there &apos;s not a couple of thousand goals .
basically , it &apos;s going to go out on the <unk> , and put it on the <unk> in <unk> .
so i said to my assistant , &quot; take me a list of all experts for <unk> and power from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and they <unk> their knowledge to compare their expertise to what we found in the code and in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the little digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the rotor is this moving fraction of the centrifuge , this black object that you see .
and if you look at the speed of this consortium of light , you actually have to crack the rotor of the rotor , and then finally , to make the centrifuge explode .
what we &apos;ve found is that the goal of the attack actually was , it &apos;s slow down , and it &apos;s going to happen dramatically -- obviously , in the attempt of trying to get involved in the trial , so they can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to get behind it .
the great digital <unk> -- we got a view by looking at very precise data and <unk> .
so , for example , the number is very out of this code ; you can &apos;t miss it .
i started using scientific literature , about how these sailors are built in <unk> , and found that they &apos;re embedded in so-called <unk> , and each <unk> has <unk> <unk> .
so that made sense , it would fit together .
and it was even better .
these ringed seals in iran are in 15 .
and guess what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so , again , that was really good together .
and that gave us great confidence for that we examined here .
now , you don &apos;t get me wrong , that didn &apos;t just go like that .
these results were going through several weeks of hard work .
and in fact , we just got into a <unk> and we had to redesign ourselves .
anyway , we found that both of these digital warheads are actually based on one and the same goal , but from different directions .
the little <unk> takes a <unk> , and it <unk> the rotors and slowed down , and the large hadron collider with six <unk> in interaction and light valves .
so , in the great world , we &apos;re very hopeful that we &apos;ve actually determines what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry about other people &apos;s goals .
here &apos;s a really cool stuff that we discovered -- it &apos;s really out of the socks of the socks .
down there is the gray box , and it &apos;s on the top , you see the <unk> .
now , what this thing is , it &apos;s the <unk> values of sensors -- so for example , for example , of <unk> and <unk> -- and it &apos;s going to be <unk> code , which is still in the attack , with the wrong trial .
and in fact , this false sketch is already taken by <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in samboja lestari , where the oil blowout is used to be fed with earlier .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
now , the idea of this is obviously not just the <unk> in the control .
in fact , it &apos;s much more dangerous and more ethically .
the idea is to put a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> where a human <unk> can &apos;t respond fast enough .
so in a power station , for example , if the big aquifer is too quick , you have to open source plants in milliseconds .
of course , this can &apos;t be done by a human <unk> .
so at this point we need digital <unk> .
and when the stakes are , then really bad things can happen .
that power can explode .
and it &apos;s not the <unk> , even the <unk> is going to notice .
that &apos;s frightening .
but it &apos;s going to be worse .
and what i say is very important .
think about it . this attack is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , it would work so well -- in a power station , or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- when the finishes -- you don &apos;t have to put the <unk> on a <unk> stick , as we &apos;ve seen it at <unk> .
you could also use a regular <unk> technology to spread .
you just have to spread it as far as you can .
and when you do that , you end up with a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s the consequence we have to confront .
so unfortunately , the greatest number of goals are not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we &apos;ve got to put ourselves the consequences and we &apos;re going to get better .
thank you .
i have a question .
ralph , it &apos;s been reported that people assume that the <unk> is the <unk> .
that &apos;s also your opinion ?
okay , you want to know that ?
yes . okay .
and i think , in my opinion , it &apos;s the <unk> , but the driving force is not israel .
so the driving force is the <unk> superpower .
there &apos;s only one and these are the united states -- fortunately , for happiness .
because otherwise , our problem would be even bigger .
thanks to you , you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> . thank you .
i spent the last couple of years trying to place myself in situations that usually really difficult , and at the same time , are kind of dangerous .
i went to jail -- hard .
i worked in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i filmed in <unk> -- difficult and dangerous .
and i spent 30 days trying to eat nothing than this -- reading at the beginning , a little bit difficult in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i found myself the biggest part of my career looking for <unk> situations , which is all for trying to study the new way that you &apos;re thinking about , and hopefully in a way of explaining what you &apos;re doing for the audience and to do .
so when i knew i would come here to look at a tedtalk the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew that i would make something a little different .
some of you may have heard that i have a display on ebay .
i got a bunch of <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> on my tedtalk .
in fact , a few happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , the unique opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure that chris anderson will never let that to buy -- the <unk> of the talks that you &apos;re going to see .
so , what you got was this : your name here presented here : my tedtalk that you have no idea what &apos;s going to be the subject , and then you end up going to be able to fly after the ears , especially if i work your company for your participation .
but once again , it &apos;s a very good citizen opportunity .
do you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
by by the way , this is just the <unk> .
so despite this warning , i knew anybody would buy the <unk> .
so if you &apos;d been asked this one year ago , i would have not been able to tell you that with certainty .
but in the new project where i work , my new film , we study the world of marketing , advertising .
as i said , i &apos;ve gone through a pretty awful situations in some pretty awful situations , but nothing could prepare me , and i couldn &apos;t go to anything as hard as it was difficult and as dangerous as these guys into a space .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where the whole film is funded by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what &apos;s happening in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; is that everything , from the very beginning to the end , is totally covered with brands -- from the <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the movie , that &apos;s the brand <unk> <unk> .
now the brand , the <unk> center , the <unk> center ...
these guys will be connected to the film in infinity -- forever .
and so the film is going to study this whole idea -- that &apos;s what ? in eternity , forever ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to date .
it was &quot; in eternity . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand of x , but we &apos;re going to make sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a shoe and it &apos;s going to be the greatest shoe you &apos;ve ever worn ...
the greatest car you &apos;ve ever driven , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; the greatest drink you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so the idea is to show apart that brands are part of life , actually , to bring it to the film ?
and we &apos;re actually showing the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the whole film is transparency .
you &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the movie of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from beginning to end .
and i would be happy if <unk> was helping it to make it happen .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people are going to be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use &quot; perspective , &quot; because this has a negative <unk> -- but you know how that &apos;s going to be ?
how much money is it takes to realize that ?
1.5 million .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s not worth it , but i think it &apos;s worth any really familiar .
who knows if the film comes out of the movie , we might see like a <unk> <unk> .
what do you think the answer is going to be ?
the answer is probably not going to be &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a difficult thing because of the movie or a difficult thing to me ?
jk : both .
so , means not that optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
fantastic .
we need to think about the brands .
yes .
if you look at the people you have to do with ...
there are some places that we can address .
put the camera out .
i thought , &quot; well , imagine the camera out of &quot; dignity that we wanted to make a <unk> .
it turns out that it turns out , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so disappeared all these companies , one after the other .
i wanted something to do with the film .
i was struck .
they wanted nothing to do with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising is to present your product as many people as possible , as many people can see .
especially in the world today , this intersection of new and old media and the <unk> media landscape -- it &apos;s not the idea of being in this new new exciting technology , that the crowds is going to bring that message .
no , that was what i thought .
but look , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that was that .
in fact , that was not the mistake at all .
it wouldn &apos;t have been a problem at all .
it would have been okay .
but what this picture represents is a problem .
you see , if you look transparency at the core sector , this is one of the first images that seems to appear .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
that was the problem : transparency -- of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> , immediately , <unk> , <unk> from <unk> and the access to information , especially what <unk> -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re listening to a whole lot of transparency about transparency .
our politicians say , our president says it , even our ceos say it .
but if it &apos;s going to be implemented , it &apos;s going to change anything .
but why ? now , transparency is fear -- like this curious bear , still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and she &apos;s also very risky .
what else ?
it &apos;s a whole <unk> cool <unk> .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started speaking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to forgive a story , but we only want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a child , and my father was feeling -- and he &apos;s sitting there and looking at me with this view -- he would say , &quot; my son , there are three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the true version . &quot;
so you can see , with this film , we wanted to tell the true version .
but there was only one company , a agency ready to help us -- and just because i had john bond and richard <unk> for years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to go through the <unk> , and i had to go straight with my team .
so what they suddenly started to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that , when you start talking with these companies , the idea of how your brand is understood , is an energetic problem .
i have friends , the big , gigantic <unk> , and i have friends , the little <unk> , as i do .
and my friends , the large , gigantic <unk> , is that the reason their films are so successful , on the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends that are going to make little <unk> , &quot; well , how are we going to compete with these big , gigantic <unk> ? &quot;
and the film called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what are we going to see in the movie ?
every time i make myself go away , and whenever i open the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see <unk> <unk> .
and every time i throw somebody out , i can say , &quot; are you cute enough for this interview ?
are you going to be a little bit nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you ought to be a little bit of it a little bit of this . &quot;
and then we go to one of these great <unk> .
&quot; <unk> fusion , &quot; or &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; they &apos;ll have the choice .
we &apos;re going to be both for men and for women -- stuck , <unk> , or stick , whatever .
that &apos;s the <unk> .
now , i can all answer your questions and give them a coherent scale .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
as you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we are as a brand .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like other brands .
so , these things -- you know , remembered people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
so what words would you describe to describe ?
it &apos;s <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
woman &apos;s technology .
technology is not the way you describe something that &apos;s going to be someone under the <unk> .
we &apos;re talking about bold , fresh .
i think &quot; <unk> &quot; is a great word that this group is really too much to something positive , as opposed to &quot; fight odor and humidity . &quot;
it keeps you fresh .
how can we hold them longer -- better fresh , more fresh , three times .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and that &apos;s a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street that are like me , <unk> .
you want to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
<unk> , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like like nice clothing .
woman &apos;s hit on <unk> , except at the <unk> .
now , what &apos;s the brand brand ?
spectacular .
i think the <unk> , the style i have , is probably &quot; <unk> glamour . &quot;
i like a lot of black colors , many <unk> and such a stuff .
but usually i have a <unk> , like <unk> , or a jewelry and such a stuff .
woman &apos;s a brand if a brand would be a brand , he would probably be a classic mercedes <unk> .
man 2 : the brand i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
woman # 2 : part wingspan , part of the -- i don &apos;t know .
man three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> across all the country , globally .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
that &apos;s my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
man 4 : my brand is fedex because i &apos;ve been <unk> .
man 5 : brand <unk> <unk> <unk> .
is that ?
sp : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i &apos;m tom .
now , we can &apos;t be all the <unk> , but i often look at the intersection of <unk> glamour and <unk> <unk> .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could penetrate in my head , someone that could really help me understand what &apos;s called the &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have helped companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , trying to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for those , you could definitely help me .
they brought their pictures , right ?
that &apos;s what i have . the first image is a picture of my family .
let me just tell you a little bit about how that is connected to your thoughts and feelings about it .
these are the people that shapes my worldview .
talk to me about this world .
<unk> : that world ? i think the world is the world where you live -- how people around you , the friends , the family , the family , the family , the way you live your life , the way you live .
all of these things came and start from a place , and for me , and start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next . this was the most beautiful day of my life .
what context is that to the thought and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are obsolete . i like curious things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what does it bring us ?
what &apos;s the <unk> ? what are you going to be right now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what represents the red ?
talk to me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
what else <unk> have you gone through ?
i don &apos;t have to be afraid . what kinds of rollercoaster are they have ?
<unk> ! no , thank you !
thank you very much .
yes . now . okay .
yes , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to happen .
there was a lot of crazy things out there .
the first thing that i saw was this idea that their <unk> were two separate , but <unk> pages -- the morgan <unk> is an <unk> / / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ;
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a contradiction with it .
and i think some companies are going to focus on a strength , rather than both .
many companies tend to -- and that &apos;s human nature -- things that they &apos;re not secure , they &apos;re going to avoid anxiety , these elements , and they &apos;re actually going to turn them into something positive , and they &apos;re actually turning it into something positive , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other brands are doing ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can also see it here , <unk> , wii , mini by mini <unk> and <unk> .
now , there are <unk> brands and <unk> brands , these things that come and go , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand . how is your brand ?
when someone asked them to describe their <unk> , their <unk> , what would you be ?
you &apos;re a <unk> ? are you something that the blood is going to be in <unk> ?
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are you something that &apos;s slightly quiet , <unk> , conservatives ?
<unk> are things that are playful , both like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , agile and agile , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like <unk> .
or are they more like a <unk> ?
are they mindful and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they established , traditionally , <unk> , <unk> , compassionate , how oprah ?
are they reliable , stable , <unk> , secure , <unk> , holy , cost-effective , how the dalai lama or <unk> ?
over the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies that were hunter-gatherers and <unk> and the &quot; no &quot; because she didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do anything with this movie because they didn &apos;t have control , no control over the finished product .
but it &apos;s going to be 17 <unk> who were willing to give up on those control , who were willing to do business with somebody as well as i was , and the <unk> , and then <unk> us to tell stories that we didn &apos;t have to be able to tell -- stories that would never have happened .
it <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film , that you &apos;re using video games to make the <unk> of the brain , both to make advertising and movies .
we drove to sao paulo , where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city for five years there &apos;s no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , no <unk> , nothing .
and we drove in a newspaper where companies were adopting their way in foreign schools , in america .
and the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got the most feedback or where i had the biggest success , those are where i started with things .
and that &apos;s what these brands did .
because it <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the agencies , they said , well , maybe the agencies don &apos;t really have their interest in meaning .
i &apos;m going to negotiate with the artist .
i &apos;m going to work with him and build something completely different , something that people are thinking to think that our national happiness are .
and how did that look for you ? what do it successful ?
now , as the film film film festival has been festival , we can look at this .
it was the <unk> in january , and since then -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 900 million <unk> of this film .
this is actually only one of the two two weeks of two weeks .
it &apos;s only online -- no press , no tv .
the film didn &apos;t even know .
it doesn &apos;t even online it online . no <unk> .
he hasn &apos;t come out in other countries .
now , finally , the film has a very large tube .
and that &apos;s not bad for a project where almost every stall that we talked about , we talked to their clients to give the fingers .
i think what i believe is that , if you have your chance of influence , risk recognizing that in these risks .
i think when you get people out of it , you get them closer to failing .
i believe that if you &apos;ve trained your employees to avoid hazards , you get the whole company prepared to acquire a profit .
i felt that we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to be afraid of the possibilities that they might be <unk> .
finally , in the face , we should welcome the fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
they welcome the fear . welcome the risk .
so that &apos;s a great taste of a big taste , so we &apos;re going to welcome the risk .
and finally , we should be able to welcome transparency .
nowadays , more than ever before , a little bit of honesty .
and that said , with honesty and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; she &apos;s called transparency , &quot; was reported by my good friends of <unk> , who served for sale for the <unk> on ebay .
big data will be transformed for organizations around the world in large opportunities .
<unk> presents : &quot; you &apos;re going to welcome transparency &quot;
thank you very much .
now , morgan , in the name of transparency this : what &apos;s the only thing that happens to the $ 50,000 <unk> ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i have a check in my pocket , <unk> on the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> -- a check in altitude to finance my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
18 months ago , i was doing something else on google , and i was working on doing something with museums and art , and my <unk> , which is today , and i &apos;ve got the green light today .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> negotiations and stories , i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the display .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide and its access .
i grew up in india .
i got a great education -- i didn &apos;t shave -- but i didn &apos;t have access to many museums and this artwork , no access .
when i went to go and visit those museums , i started learning a lot .
and as i was working for google , i tried to do this longing -- art could do with technology -- using technology together .
we then started a team , a great crew , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and tell you some interesting things that happened since the launch .
so you just go to <unk> .
you can look at all of these museums here .
there &apos;s the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the van gogh .
i even come in one of my favorite , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
you come in two ways in it -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in the museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- bombay , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
you go around and be fulfilled .
they want to be in the museum ?
open up the card , and jumping them with a click .
in fact , they want to go to the end of the gangs .
just on . a lot of fun .
take it .
thank you , but the best thing happens .
now , i am in front of one of my <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the met .
i see this <unk> .
when the museum gave us the picture , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
these are all the metadata .
those of you who are really interested in art can click here -- but i &apos;m going to do it now .
this is one of the pictures we &apos;ve been doing with the so-called <unk> .
this image , for example , has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
now i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can go into it very easily and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is unaffordable .
but then they really want to go inside .
and so i started playing around , and i noticed that there was something happening there .
and i thought , &quot; wait a minute , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went to close , and i realized slowly that these children actually put something together .
i was a little bit earlier with a bunch of familiar with the met , and it actually found that it &apos;s a game called <unk> , where one of the <unk> is a force at the <unk> with a stick .
it was quite popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to go really close to the <unk> , you can go to the cracks .
just to give you the overview , i &apos;m out of it , so you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the picture .
but the best thing is , in a second .
let &apos;s quickly jump back to moma , again in new york .
one more <unk> of mine , <unk> .
so in the previous example , it was about finding detail .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what if you want to see van gogh making this masterpiece ?
you go inside . you can really go inside .
i &apos;m going to zoom into one of my favorite features of this picture , until i really get to the slot .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s many other ones , but i don &apos;t have time to have time .
that &apos;s the really cool part , it &apos;s called racing .
each of them , everyone -- right or poor , whether you have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can go online and online your own museum -- from all these pictures , you can put your own collection .
it &apos;s just going to go into -- and i &apos;ve created this , it &apos;s called the power of <unk> -- you can <unk> .
that &apos;s the <unk> , in the <unk> .
you can put it all up with <unk> , send your friends , and i start talking about what you feel when you look at these masterpieces .
i think , unfortunately , i think , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not going to come here from google .
it &apos;s not even from the museums .
i should not say that .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope we &apos;re going to be dealing with this digital medium of art , and putting it online online .
what &apos;s the biggest question i asked recently : &quot; did you have done this to replicate the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s going to be the experience of experience .
that &apos;s why . thank you .
thank you .
this is a marker of your brain . your brain can be stored in two halves .
that &apos;s the left half , which is the logical site , and then the right half , which is the intuitive side .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every hemisphere , we could have your brain .
for instance , this one would be completely bizarre .
this is somebody who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you see your brain on this scale ?
some of us might have thought to be one of these extremes , but i think , for most people in the audience , your brain looks like this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time in both of them .
it &apos;s not like they &apos;re both exclusive or something like that .
they can be logically and intuitively .
and so , as one of the people , as one of the individuals , with the most other experimental experimental <unk> that need a good proportion of logic to add the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good percentage of intuition to actually do the experiments .
how do we develop that intuition ? well , we love to play things with things .
so we go out and play it , and then look like it , and then we start developing our intuition .
they basically make the same thing .
so one of the study you &apos;ve developed about the years is probably that one thing can only be at a place at the same time .
i mean , it might sound familiar with that , that one thing at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed it .
i remember a child playing a child playing on a two-wheeler .
he was a toddler and not very good at it , and he constantly fell on .
but i bet that this plays the play with a very valuable lesson , which is the big stuff you don &apos;t just leave you with , and you &apos;re going to stay in a place .
and that &apos;s a great <unk> model of the world , so long as you &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be a terrible model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and when you play with your particles , you &apos;re all familiar with all kinds of funny things -- how that you can fly directly through walls , or you can be on two different places in two different places .
and so they wrote all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the state of physics a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics about the little , tiny , little particles .
but you didn &apos;t need it to describe the big everyday objects around us .
that &apos;s not my intuition , and that might only be because i don &apos;t have a lot of things with particles .
well , i play sometimes with them , but not very often .
and i &apos;ve never seen them .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but my logical side didn &apos;t enjoy it either .
because if all the things come out of particles and all of these particles are changing the rules of quantum mechanics , then , wouldn &apos;t you just follow the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see why that should not be like this .
so i &apos;d better be able to feel better with the whole thing , if we could somehow show that <unk> is also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so , a few years ago , i was working on this .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that was in the <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see that green dot there in the middle there .
that &apos;s the piece of the metal i &apos;m going to talk about .
that &apos;s a picture of the object .
this is where i get it . we look at the center here in the center here .
and here &apos;s a really big close-up of this little piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a little piece of metal as a springboard and it &apos;s about the edge of the edge .
so i did this thing in similar ways that you make a computer chip .
i went to a clean space with new <unk> , and <unk> for 100 hours on all the major ones .
for the last one , i had to build my own machine -- to get this kind of like a <unk> prisoner of <unk> hole and that thing .
this thing has the ability to be in the <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a full elevator ?
i mean , if i &apos;m alone in the elevator , i &apos;m going to do all kinds of funny things , but then you go to other people , and i &apos;m listening to all of these things because i don &apos;t want to stand with it , or , frankly , you <unk> .
so he says , &quot; well , that <unk> objects are just as comfortable . &quot;
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not only humans , but the light that seems to you , and the wind that &apos;s going to you over and over and the heat of space .
and so we knew that when we wanted to see that this piece of metal is changing , we had to cut all the <unk> out of <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we put it on the light , put it into a vacuum and <unk> all the air , and <unk> it down to almost right now , in the elevator , the piece of metal was free to behave as it was .
so we measured his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
so instead of that it &apos;s just quiet , it <unk> it . the way it was like this -- like this -- like a <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and when we gave him a little push , we could sell it at the same time , and we weren &apos;t allowed to vibrate -- something which was allowed to be allowed in the mechanics .
so what i &apos;m just about to give you right now is fantastic .
what does it mean for a object at the same time and not sell to vibrate ?
let &apos;s think about the atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms that are the piece of the piece of the metal , and at the same time , the same atoms gets down and down .
just access to precise <unk> voices .
the rest of the time are they <unk> .
that means that every atom in the same time is in two different places , which is actually that the entire piece of all of the metal is in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
it &apos;s worth me for all this year in the clean space , because , check that , the <unk> between a single atom and this piece of metal is about just like the difference between the piece of metal and it .
so if one single atom at the same time can be two different places , that piece of metal can be two different locations , why not ?
i mean , that &apos;s just what my logical side .
so , imagine you would be at the same time in several places , how would that feel ?
how would your mind start expressing your body in the room ?
there &apos;s another part of the story of history .
when we <unk> it , the light hits the light and <unk> the box , we saw that the piece of metal is always in a piece .
and so i had to develop these new intuition that it looks like all the objects in the elevator actually are only temporary objects that are embedded in a small room .
you hear a lot about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not quite right .
there &apos;s more , it &apos;s still deeper than that .
it &apos;s that these connections , their ties with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
and in 2007 , i decided that we should be thinking about how we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that when families think about where they live and work , they want to give them the possibility to give them an opportunity to connect to a hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new citizens .
right now , we &apos;re very far from this goal .
there are billions of people in developing countries that are not even a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth so much more than it costs them .
so , we could just do the world with <unk> , perhaps hundreds of hundreds of new cities .
now , this may sound absurd for you , if you haven &apos;t thought about new cities .
now , if you look at the building blocks of apartments against cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in homes , they have already done that ; the other half is not yet .
they could try to expand the capacity of the existing apartments .
but you know what they &apos;d be like to be in these homes and their environment , law to avoid malnutrition and <unk> <unk> .
so it turns out to be very hard out of all of these extensions .
but you could go to a completely new place , build a whole new retreat , as long as the laws would give you such a building and not be able to do it .
so i &apos;ve suggested that governments can create new areas that provide enough space for a city and give them a name : <unk> cities .
later , i found out that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> over the challenge of a reform in honduras .
they knew that every year , their country left their country to go into the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country , and they can do exactly the same thing in honduras .
at this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we get a moist area of our country , which is , if we just put them on a message , a part of the american embassy -- a part of the canadian embassy , and when people are going to work in the canadian , they can work there , and can they go to the area of those notes , and can they work there , they can go to the area of the paper , and they can go to the area of the
in the summer of 2009 , we had been suffering under a severe <unk> .
the nearest <unk> elections , won <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , whose program are both innovations , as well as <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> to become his <unk> .
in the meantime , i was writing on a talk at tedglobal .
through improvement , jeanny and through the study of consumers , i &apos;ve tried to reduce this complicated concept of the <unk> city .
the first point is the importance of laws , laws that determine that you can &apos;t tell existing <unk> .
we &apos;re giving new technologies , but for the public demand , it uses technology and laws , and it &apos;s usually laws that are heading us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend from guatemala <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
the <unk> showed him .
the two call me .
and said , &quot; let &apos;s put it the head of our country . &quot;
so we met in december in the <unk> of a hotels in miami .
i &apos;ve been trying to make sure how valuable cities are cities , how much more valuable they are as they cost .
and i &apos;ve been using these graphics to show you how value <unk> is in a place like new york . remember that there &apos;s a place in some cases in some cases , thousands of dollars per square meter of dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract argument on one place than there was a break , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so , the tedtalk , in very simple form , is that an <unk> city is a place , which is the laws that defines the laws that reflects there , and the people will have the opportunity to decide to live either of those rules or not .
and that &apos;s why i was asked by the president of honduras who said that we have to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that this is the way to bring it to our country .
i was asked to come to <unk> , and once again at the fourth and fifth january , a talk .
so i &apos;ve been able to talk to another <unk> talk , which is a graph like this , trying to illustrate that if you want to make a lot of value in a city , it has to be a very large city .
this is a picture of the city , and the sketch contained the new airport that was built in <unk> .
so , at the airport , there &apos;s an area of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to convince the <unk> of this when you want to build a new city , you have to start with an area of at least 1,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s more than 250 thousand tomorrow .
now have all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very serious and cared .
the director of congress came up on stage and said , &quot; professor <unk> , thank you very much for your lecture , but maybe we could look at the tedtalk .
i got him here on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they were playing the tedtalk .
and i &apos;ve come to the 1980 that a new city offers the people new opportunities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in honduras , from hundreds of miles away from the north .
and a new city includes new opportunities for leaders .
the leaders of the government in honduras would be on the help of <unk> , and they could benefit from their own <unk> , which they would have been encouraging to the laws of the law for these charter and the <unk> that everybody could trust that the charter really is going to be drawn out . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ;
and the realization of president <unk> , was that the certainty of the <unk> that i thought were thinking about as a way of getting the foreign investors to be able to come and build that city for all the parties that have been under fear and mistrust for many years under anxiety and mistrust .
we &apos;re in an area .
this is from this place .
it &apos;s a thousand square kilometers .
and shortly after , at the 19th century , you &apos;ve got a little bit of congress for a change in the constitution of the constitution to have a <unk> view for special <unk> .
in a country that has just been a <unk> crisis in the congress , in the congress , it &apos;s been picked up with a voice to a voice .
all parties , all the <unk> of society , they supported this .
in order to become part of the constitution , it &apos;s got to be eradicated by congress .
at the 17th february , it was taken for the second time with <unk> to a voice .
so after this election , between the 21st and february of february , a delegation of about 30 <unk> of the two places of the world that were most interested in the world that were most interested in the business of the <unk> .
one place is south .
this is a picture of a large , new urban sphere built in south korea built as the <unk> .
so all you can see on this picture is actually built by four years after it took four years to preserve the permits .
the other place that was very interested in is singapore .
it was already two cities in china , and the third one is in preparation .
so if you think about it , it &apos;s that where we are today .
they already have a <unk> ; and they already have this area for the second city .
it &apos;s already been working on a physical system that allows people to participate , and it &apos;s going to work on a external basis .
a country already has offered to provide his supreme court , as a court for the <unk> appeal of the <unk> system . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and also , <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring funding with one .
one of the things you already know , there &apos;s been a lot of <unk> .
there are lots of things that would be like in america , especially at a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who &apos;d like to live there .
over the world , there are 700 million people that they want to live in a different place .
a million people killed every year and go to the united states .
many of you are fathers who are forced to get their families to <unk> , sometimes it &apos;s translucent mothers that have enough money to make food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes it &apos;s children who are trying to find their parents that they have seen in some cases , in some cases , for a decade .
so what &apos;s an idea about thinking about this in honduras a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of thousands of around the world ?
so what &apos;s it for an idea to insist on that every family has a choice between several cities that are in competition to be new citizens ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
my friends from honduras have asked me to say thank you ted .
you know how many choices you make on a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you meet in a typical week ?
i recently did a survey with about 2,000 americans , and the average number of choices that <unk> a typical american on a day is <unk> <unk> .
in recently , recently did a trial with ceos that they took a week for a week .
and these scientists have documented the different topics that have been engaged with this ceo , and how much time they have spent money to make decisions that relate to the issues .
and they found that an average ceo was engaged in the week with <unk> tasks .
of course , of course , of course , of course , many smaller choices .
50 percent of their choices have been given in nine minutes or less .
it &apos;s about 12 percent of their choices for about 12 percent of their choices .
think of their own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you meet in the nine minutes in the nine minutes of an hour ?
how good do you think you &apos;re dealing with ?
today i &apos;d like to talk about one of the biggest culprits in our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some possible solutions .
now , when i talk about this problem , i &apos;ll give you a few questions , and i want to know your answers .
when i ask you a question , you know , because i &apos;m blind , only the hand when you want to burn a few calories .
so , if i ask you , if i ask you a question , and your answer is , well , my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very , very <unk> , at at the time at at the time .
it was a store , the <unk> &apos;s .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different types of mustard and <unk> and over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different types of water -- and that was at a time when we were actually drinking <unk> .
i loved it to go to that business , but at a time i &apos;d asked myself , well , how is it that you &apos;re never going to be anything ?
here &apos;s the olive oil gear .
they had about 75 different constructs , including those that were embedded in neighborhoods that came from a thousand years old <unk> .
so i decided to go to the leader one day , and i asked the ladder , &quot; works this model that you really want to offer the people all of these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up the <unk> of tourists who came every day and usually their cameras .
we decided to do an experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
this is her <unk> gear .
they had <unk> different types of <unk> .
we have a little <unk> directly at the entrance to the <unk> .
we &apos;ve got six different flavors <unk> , or 24 different <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i mean , what would more people have to stand on and <unk> ?
there are more people standing there when it was 24 , about 60 percent than when it was six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at what people were doing to a glass of glass .
now we saw the damn effect .
now , from the people who were there when it was 24 , only three percent actually had a glass of plastic .
now , from the people who stood up when it was six , now we saw 30 percent of them actually bought a glass of plastic bags .
now , if you calculate it , people would spend six times a little <unk> , who you had six to choice than when you had 24 .
now , to decide not to buy glass of glass , it &apos;s good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our waist -- but it turns out that the <unk> is affecting us as well .
we don &apos;t decide to decide even though it &apos;s about our own best interests .
so the subject of the day : price save .
i &apos;m going to show you a study that i did with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , where we could make decisions about the retirement of almost a million americans from about 650 plans in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of internet users that were able to make a difference , which is the probability that affects the probability of whether more tomorrow is going to be saved for tomorrow .
and what we found was that , in fact , there was a correlation .
so in these plans , we had about <unk> plans , which is something that people have something between two to 15 different occasions .
and what we found was that the more money had been offered that , in fact , the participation remains less .
now , if you look at the extremes , the plans that the two hits , had a <unk> in the education -- still not as high as we want .
in the plans that nearly 60 hits , the <unk> is now at about the <unk> <unk> .
now it turns out that even when you &apos;re going to go to <unk> , if more possibilities for choice , even then , it has negative consequences .
that &apos;s how the people who decided they were going to be more like the more opportunities they were , the more they have , the more they have to establish it and choose to be able to vote with each other , and they have to be able to vote for them to vote . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ;
the more opportunities you have available , the more you put your money in pure <unk> .
none of these extreme choices , belongs to the choices that someone &apos;s recommend would recommend when we teach their future well-being is important .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three essential consequences of the consequences that bring that to more choices to more and more choices .
it feeds the decision -- push them on , even if it &apos;s against their own their own best interest .
they make more worse choices -- poorer financial and worse medical decisions .
they &apos;re going to decide for things that they make themselves less happy , even if they make it objective .
the main reason is that we might enjoy this enormous debt of <unk> , mustard , <unk> and <unk> , but we can &apos;t be able to draw the comparison and market in fact , and then actually , from the fantastic services .
so what i &apos;d like to suggest to you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we tested in various ways and have tested tested -- they can just apply in their business .
first of all , 18,000 .
you &apos;ve heard it before , but it was never true than today , that less .
the people are always worried when i say , &quot; learning . &quot;
they &apos;re always worried that they &apos;re losing <unk> .
but in fact , we &apos;re going to see it more and more that if you &apos;re ready to knit , and the <unk> <unk> opportunities are going to be released , now , then there &apos;s a rise of sales , it will cost the cost of the sales , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s an improvement of <unk> .
as a cross-country and gamble , the different light bulb and <unk> sorts of 26 on 15 salaries , they have a rise of sales to 10 percent .
when the golden flush corporation gave her 10 to the <unk> <unk> <unk> , you know that profits increases 87 percent of the time -- a result of two , the rise of the sales and the reduction of cost .
you know , the average <unk> today is offering you 45,000 products .
a typical wal-mart offers them today 100,000 products .
but the <unk> supermarket , which is now <unk> supermarket in the world today , and they &apos;re offering them only 1,400 products -- a kind of tomato sauce in doses .
now in the world of <unk> , i think one of the greatest examples that recently come to market , about how you best <unk> the choices , was something that david <unk> has been very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be offered to harvard .
now , every single harvard half of life is automatically encoded in a <unk> .
people who really want to make a choice will be offered to 20 each disease , not 300 or more .
you know , as people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how to give it to you .
it &apos;s all important opportunities . &quot;
and the first thing i asked the employees is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities is different from each other .
and if their employees are not able to reset them , they can &apos;t do their customers . &quot;
now , before we started lunch , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he &apos;d be prepared to be prepared for all the people in this audience to the most beautiful road in the world .
this is a description of the road .
and i &apos;d like to read it to you .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read them , and then i ask them to clap , if you &apos;re willing to assume gary &apos; s .
okay . everyone &apos;s prepared to assume gary &apos;s .
that all ?
okay , let me give you a little bit more of that .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
now , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think i &apos;ve probably heard more hands .
good .
in fact , when you look at the first time , the first time had more information than the second time , but i would dare to do it for the second time .
because the pictures made it to be true for them .
which brings me to the second technique that helps you deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about people to understand the difference between opportunities , which are the consequences of the individual possibilities that are associated with each other , and that would have to be felt that consequences and concrete .
why do people spend roughly 15 to 30 percent , if you use a <unk> or a credit card than in cash ?
because it doesn &apos;t really feel money .
and it turns out that if you make something concrete , it &apos;s a very good tool , so that you get people to save more people .
so , in a study that i did with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- employees that have worked for <unk> -- and those people were all in a street where they had their participation for their <unk> .
and during that meeting , we &apos;ve got these tedx just as close as it was always , we &apos;ve added a little <unk> .
the little thing that we had about <unk> is we asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their lives if they save money .
in that simple thing , there was an increase of participation around 20 percent , and there was one rise of the number of people who were ready to save or a rise to four percent of the time you were willing to pay for the <unk> .
the third technique : <unk> .
we can do better than we can handle more choices .
here &apos;s , for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out it &apos;s going down into the <unk> <unk> , and down in the northeast space , the number of magazines had different kinds of magazines to <unk> <unk> .
but you know what ?
if i give you 600 papers and put them in 10 categories , or i would give you 400 magazines , and those in 20 categories , you think , i &apos;ve given you more choice and a better <unk> , when i gave you the distribution .
because the categories tell me how to make it apart .
here are two different constructs .
one is called &quot; jazz &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left eyebrow is <unk> , and the readout is jazz , then they clap into your hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that the on the left is jazz , and the one on the right is <unk> , then they clap .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the on the left is jazz and the on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a huge disconnect of <unk> .
the categories have to say something , not to tell the choice of the selection .
and that problem is often shown when you look at the long bullet of all of these fund .
so what do you want to do with it ?
my fourth technique : embrace for complexity .
it turns out we can actually deal with more information than we think , we just need to simplify them .
we need to increase the complexity .
i &apos;ll show you one example of what i mean .
let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : the purchase of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> who gives you the opportunity to <unk> your car &apos;s own car .
they have to make different choices to make their car completely .
now these choices are different from choices in the number of choices that make them a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the cars -- i have 56 possibilities .
cheap , check -- four choices .
now , what i do now is , i change the order in which the choices are .
half of the users are going to be heard of the many possibilities , 56 <unk> to the very small opportunities , four gears .
the other half of the users have been talking about , four continents , to the 56 <unk> , lots of possibilities .
what do i look at ?
how are you interested in .
if you &apos;re constantly using the <unk> of the decision , that you &apos;re going to be catastrophic , the <unk> , i &apos;m losing it .
what you &apos;re finding is that the people that go from the many to the very low <unk> , and over and over and over and over again .
we &apos;re losing them .
go from the little choices to the many , then you stay there .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same amount of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is the order of changing this information .
when i start with the simple one , i &apos;m learning how to go through .
even though the check requires nothing to tell me anything about my preferences at the conference , it &apos;s still sorry about exposing me .
and it &apos;s also confused to me in excitement about the big product that i &apos;m <unk> , and that &apos;s why i &apos;m willing to be involved with interest .
so let me wrap up .
i told you about four techniques , which is the problem of <unk> -- nevertheless -- you &apos;re going to get rid of the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- make it real ; <unk> -- we can handle more categories .
so every one of these techniques that i have to tell you today is to help them give them the possibilities -- good for you , you can use them for yourself , good for the people that they offer .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in selecting selection .
and the more we &apos;re going to be the more we are , the better we &apos;re going to be able to practice the art of choice .
thank you .
hi . i &apos;m kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . so i look at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk to you about how video games are going to be <unk> , and then that &apos;s why that &apos;s important .
we all want to be <unk> -- celebrities , singer , comedians -- when i was young , that seemed so hard .
but <unk> have made that we all have , all of us , all of our creative activities can be done in a part of the culture of our world .
each one of you could be about the internet to next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute .
again , that &apos;s only going to be a tiny percentage of ever , and it &apos;s viewed thousands of times , and that &apos;s the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , let &apos;s do that .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> wrote this video that he had filmed his house in the yosemite national park .
in 2010 , it had been looked at 23 million times .
this graph shows what it looked like when the video was reported for the first time .
in fact , disabled doesn &apos;t want to do a viral video .
he just wanted to share a three-year-old .
because that &apos;s what you do when you go to the <unk> <unk> .
he had a lot of <unk> uploaded .
and this video was actually been sent in january .
what &apos;s going on here ?
there was jimmy <unk> .
jimmy <unk> <unk> <unk> the tweet , which was so popular .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> puts us new and interesting things , and show you a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> on <unk> . <unk> &apos;s <unk> &apos;s <unk> sent to the <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> . <unk> &apos; <unk> on <unk> . she didn &apos;t think that we were going to lead that conversation without talking about this video , i hope .
rebecca <unk> <unk> is one of the most recent videos of the year .
this year , almost 200 million times .
this is what the image looked like .
it seems to be like &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; it seems to be like nothing .
what happened to that day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know it , those other tips are also <unk> .
but what about that day , this particular friday ?
now , <unk> <unk> it , a lot of blogs began to write about it .
michael <unk> <unk> from the <unk> science fiction was a first one that did a joke about this .
what &apos;s important is that a person or a group of <unk> is a point of view , with a big audience and <unk> the process .
then this community of people who shared this big <unk> shared , and started to talk about it , to <unk> .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
in the first seven days , there was a spoof for each week .
contrary to the <unk> entertainment entertainment , the participation of the community is our way of becoming part of this phenomenon -- either by spreading it or something new out of it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
it &apos;s very simple .
this year , it &apos;s been looked like 50 million times .
and if you hold that for crazy , you should know that there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
so watching cats look at the cats that look at this video .
it &apos;s important to creativity , which is the creativity of <unk> and <unk> .
there was eight .
someone was making an old-fashioned version of it .
and then it became international .
it &apos;s a whole <unk> survey from the ground that made it from a stupid joke to something that we can all participate in .
today we don &apos;t just find pleasure on something we &apos;re doing .
anyone could you have predicted that ?
who would have called &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; or rebecca black or &quot; <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
what <unk> would you write to write in that ?
in a world where every minute a minute and a half days of video , there &apos;s only really unique and unexpected <unk> like the <unk> video .
i admit , i was not very interested when i said a friend , i was to look at this great video , about a guy who in new york for bicycles of bicycles .
i got a traffic ticket because i didn &apos;t get on the <unk> , but there &apos;s lots of challenges that don &apos;t drive you to drive into the <unk> .
since that was completely surprising and humorous , casey was seen casey with the <unk> idea and his argument of five million times .
so this approach is all new , what we do creative .
and that &apos;s all that leads us to a big question ...
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , entirely unexpected , are the features of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to that , and in which the audience defines .
as i said , one of the world &apos;s largest stars -- justin  -- he &apos;s got his beginnings at youtube .
no one has to give your ideas of green light .
and today , we &apos;re all feeling of our pop culture .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re barely seeing the media of today , but they &apos;re going to determine the entertainment entertainment of the future .
thank you .
i mean , how can i talk to 10 minutes about the relationship between women in three generations , and how the amazing strength of this connection was living in life of an existing girl , when she was about 30 years ago with her little sister , her mother and her grandmother , five days and nights in a small boat in the chinese sea , and she &apos;s going to talk to you in a little zodiac in san francisco , and she &apos;s going to talk to you today ?
the story is not over yet .
it &apos;s a jigsaw puzzle that is still popping .
i &apos;d like to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece : a man who burns his life &apos;s length .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a man whose entire life was held by the simple hope of oneness and freedom of his home .
if you think about it in the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> , as he says , his life has been a single waste .
the words , so long his friends , <unk> now .
he moved back to silence .
he died , broken by history .
it &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me live his life .
i didn &apos;t have to worry about it , and it was my job to learn that the story was trying to <unk> us , but we got it .
the next <unk> shows , like a boat in the early <unk> , <unk> into the early <unk> .
my mother was 18 when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage , already with two little girls .
for her , she had a task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was completely clear that they could fail .
after a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , a boat <unk> on the sea , as an <unk> .
they were aware of the risk of adults .
the biggest fear had them before pirates , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> at the boat .
when i was a <unk> , i had only got my sister and i was , you know , it &apos;s going to be my grandmother .
my first memories are from this boat -- the promise of the engine , the clapping of each wave on the packing , the high and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the pirates that came across a lot of times , but from the <unk> of the men on our boat , or the <unk> of the engine , the six hours didn &apos;t want to start .
but i remember the lights of <unk> from the <unk> coast , and the young man , the union and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first <unk> i gave on the platform .
no apple has ever even thought back again .
after three months in a refugee camp we landed in melbourne .
and the next <unk> is about four women in three generations that build a new life together .
we flew down in <unk> , which is one of the most natural <unk> suburb whose population is made of <unk> .
contrary to the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was totally unknown to me , in <unk> , no <unk> .
the standard from the <unk> came out of the rest of the world .
and the <unk> man-made <unk> were <unk> among people who had one thing in common : they started new .
my mother was working on farms , and then on a square kilometer in a <unk> , six days .
it kind of got to find the time to find out of english and <unk> .
we were poor .
each one has been confused and was put in other education for english and mathematics , no matter what we needed to do to that . mostly the new stuff that came out of the hand .
two <unk> for high school , each to serve the holes in the other .
a <unk> to the <unk> , because she had to pass six years .
and there were the rare but <unk> <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; and here and there , &quot; daddy , &quot; &quot; speaker , go home . &quot;
when home where ?
something <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to the reconciliation , and a calm voice said , &quot; i &apos;ll go out of the way . &quot;
my mother , my sister , and i stuck in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted every night , but we were told each other from our day , and hearing the movements of our grandmother in the house .
my mother was suffering from the boat .
and it was my job to stay awake every night until their <unk> came , so i could <unk> them .
she opened up a <unk> , and then she got a <unk> and a business plan .
and the women came with their stories about men who are not <unk> , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , trapped between two worlds .
clusters and sponsors have been searched .
dna were built .
i was living in <unk> .
in one , i was the classic asian student , the <unk> demands of himself .
in the other hand , i was involved in ongoing life , the tragic scars of violence , of the <unk> and the isolation .
but that &apos;s how many people had been helping .
and because of this help , i was born in the last year of this as a young <unk> of the year .
and i was born by a <unk> to the nearest , and the edges didn &apos;t work together .
<unk> le <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was now <unk> , refugee and social activist who were invited to the places that they had never heard of , and in habitats , whose existence would never be able to imagine .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
i wanted to go into the routine and the comfort of the life of a unknown <unk> -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters , each of the stories of their day , told each other the stories of their day , told each other the stories of their day and <unk> , we &apos;re still in the same bed .
i told my mother , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
it reminded me that i was as old as it was when we got the boat .
no one was never a possibility .
&quot; do it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i talked about <unk> and education , and the neglect of <unk> and <unk> .
and the more open i was talking about , the more i should tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of them did what they loved was living on the bounds of the possible .
and even though i graduated through my degree , i realized that i didn &apos;t have a career in denial .
there had to be another <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a maverick , a <unk> , new in the picture -- not just okay , but something you need to be grateful , maybe a godsend .
because <unk> can lead to the collapse of the horizons , so light can be so light that you accepted the assumptions of the environment .
i went to know enough from my <unk> , to know that , yes , the world is <unk> , but not how you <unk> it .
so , that didn &apos;t have been allowed , it &apos;s been <unk> .
there was a energy , a <unk> optimism , a strange inversion of humility and the <unk> .
so i followed my gut .
i &apos;d collected a little team of people around me , which is not &quot; a <unk> challenge . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have a long time ago .
and by the end of every interview , i would have a huge amount of equipment that we shared .
we went to the night late .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a bunch of brilliant , and we did the breakthrough .
i met the decision to move into the u.s.
it &apos;s only a journey there .
my gut again .
three months later , i was moved , and the adventure went on .
before i talk to the talk , i &apos;d like to tell you about my grandmother .
she grew up at a time , in the <unk> of the social norm and the local people , the most important person was the most important person .
the life hasn &apos;t changed since centuries .
her father died after her birth .
her mother moved on .
17 , she became the second woman of a friend whose mother she did .
it was a little bit of support of your man &apos;s <unk> , by putting him in front of trial and she was in her own case , and a bigger <unk> than she won . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / she won .
&quot; it &apos;s not &quot; a <unk> . &quot;
i was sitting in a hotel room in sydney when she died . 1,000 kilometers away in melbourne .
i looked through the <unk> and i saw it on the other side .
i knew they were coming to say goodbye .
my mother called me a few minutes after that .
a few days later , we went into a buddhist temple in <unk> and sat at their coffin .
we told stories , and we <unk> her that we were still in her .
at midnight , the monk and said , he needed to close the coffin .
my mother asked us to hold their hand .
she asked the monk : &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because you &apos;ve been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t have it . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band in our family , it &apos;s going through the women .
so , who we were , and how life evolved to us , we can now see that the guys who might have come to our lives to get us into the <unk> .
the defeat would have been too simple .
now i &apos;d like to do my own children , and i &apos;m still thinking about the boat .
anyone would ever be a wish ?
yes , i &apos;m afraid of privilege in front of you before <unk> , before teapots .
can i give you a bug in your life , the courageous every wave , the <unk> , is <unk> of the engine , the amount of horizon , the amount of horizon , the amount of horizon ?
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give that to you , i would do it . i would do it .
and also , <unk> mom is here in the fourth or fifth row .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with you .
is it all that photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture you can &apos;t record with your camera .
but i started my interest in photography when i received my first digital , at 15 years old .
i found it with my earlier predilection for drawing , but it was a little different , because it was a little bit different , because the camera was actually in planning .
and if you look at a picture with a camera , end of the process when you go to the trigger .
so , for me , the photography seemed to go to me at the right place at the right time at the right time at the right time .
i believed everyone could .
so i wanted something else to do something else , something that begins when the stakes is falling .
so , like this : a construction along a much quieter road .
but it has a unexpected twist .
and <unk> yet a realistic level .
or photographs like these -- dark and <unk> , but all of the common objective of keeping a realistic level .
when i say reality , i think <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can really capture , but i &apos;d like to look like this as though you could have that , on a photo .
so you have to think that you have to think a little moment to figure out the trick .
so it &apos;s more about trying to capture an idea than really a moment .
but what &apos;s the trick that makes it look like ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but ultimately , it &apos;s about how we &apos;re going to interpret the world , and how it can be made by a two-dimensional space .
it &apos;s not about realistic , but what we think is realistic .
so i think the underlying is very simple .
i look at it as a puzzle puzzle of reality where you can take different bits and sketch to create an alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
so , here we have three perfect <unk> of physical objects that we can all identify with in a three-dimensional world .
but in a certain way , you can combine something that &apos;s still <unk> , as though it might exist .
but at the same time , we know that that &apos;s not possible .
so we &apos;re advising our brains because our brain just doesn &apos;t really make sense that it doesn &apos;t make sense .
and i see the same process in combining photography .
it &apos;s really only about combining different realities .
so , the things that make a picture of value , i think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t think about , things that we &apos;re not thinking about in our everyday life .
but if we combine the pictures , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because you look just kind of false .
so i would say that there are three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , that &apos;s not three special images .
but , but you can see something special like this .
so the first rule is that combining photography should have the same perspective .
second of americans should have the same <unk> .
and these two pictures fulfill these two sets -- from the same altitude , and the same <unk> .
and third , it &apos;s about making it impossible to distinguish where the individual images start and end by making them seamlessly .
it &apos;s impossible to say , how the photo was actually created .
so by raising color , contrast and brightness to the edges of the individual images , physics causes , like <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we <unk> the boundaries between the different images , and as a single picture , there &apos;s a single picture , even though a picture is basically a picture hundreds of levels , even though there &apos;s a single picture .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is only a landscape , and the lower part of light .
now , this picture is completely complete , from pictures of different places .
i personally <unk> that it &apos;s easier to create a place than finding a place , because you don &apos;t have to compromise any trade-offs with the ideas in your head .
but it takes a lot of planning .
and when i had this idea in the winter , i knew that i needed several months to plan them , to find the different places for the rest of the puzzle .
for instance , the fish was taken on a <unk> .
the shore is from a different place .
it &apos;s from a quarry quarry .
and yes , i even got the house up on the island of red , to make it look like it .
so to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s from me looking at planning .
i always start with a <unk> , an idea .
it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a piece of very good planned .
and if you make good shots , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also quite bizarre .
so it &apos;s all the tools there , and the only thing that motivates us is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic trade-offs .
and i think the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped talking to our patients .
and one of the things we introduced at the <unk> was to make a <unk> .
it &apos;s not about scientifically scientifically -- she &apos;s putting a cup of coffee or tea tea , and asks the patients , families , relatives , are , &quot; how do you go ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want this to think that this is one of the main problems of why all of you -- maybe most of the electronic <unk> peaks : because we &apos;ve stopped listening .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
it &apos;s got a button at / / .
and every morning i &apos;ve got it .
and yeah , i have a job as you might recognize .
i have my job at 95 pounds .
it works very simple : every time i look at the temperature , you put my dataset on google health .
and there you &apos;re going to be from my <unk> , so that you can see where my <unk> is , not just the moment i have <unk> support or whatever , but with a look at the past .
but there &apos;s something else .
perhaps you &apos;re familiar with this , i have about 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i &apos;ve come to my <unk> , and people talk to me before i sit in the car , &quot; lunch just a small salad today , <unk> . &quot;
but that &apos;s the <unk> thing that can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> to help patients , because that could be used to obesity , or it could be patients that <unk> <unk> .
it could be used to get people out of their chairs and get them to play in any kind of play , to control their health .
next week , it &apos;s going to be the market .
it &apos;s going to be this little <unk> that you put on a iphone or something like that .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure , to put it in their doctor and send him with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
at that point , the patients get to play , and they can &apos;t just take control of their own ship on their own ship , but they can also help us with the health challenges that are before us , and the <unk> of health , and so on .
make a little bit of practice that are easy to use , and begin with this to hug patients in the team .
and they can do it through such practice , but also through behavioral markers .
and one of the things we did , i &apos;d like to share with you through a short video .
we have all encoded in our cars .
maybe even in our cell phones .
we know exactly where all the atms are around <unk> .
we know one where all the stations are .
and sure enough , we can find targets .
but where would the next <unk> get to help this patient ?
we &apos;ve got <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next mad date was in that moment .
so , what did we do ? we did english in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve got a website and we &apos;ve asked a website , &quot; if you see a <unk> , please share with where he is , when he &apos;s on it , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s in <unk> , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> were reported in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps of this .
and we &apos;ve created a 3d scan .
we have created an app for <unk> , augmented reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> and someone &apos;s got to go , you can use your iphone , and within the next weeks , you can use your <unk> to find the next <unk> that can save lives .
and today , we don &apos;t just want to do this as <unk> as the product is called the product , but as a result .
and we want to bring this to a global level .
and we ask our colleagues around the world , from other universities , about helping us to help ourselves look like <unk> , to crowdsource those <unk> around the world .
and when you &apos;re sitting in vacation , you get a seat , you &apos;re going to be your own creation or somebody else , you can find such a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask is that companies are helping us from the world at the end of these <unk> .
these could be <unk> , or a technician , for instance , just to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still in its own place .
please help us and try and do the health of health , not only make a difference , but to put into your hand .
thank you .
today i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in the <unk> .
and my little <unk> wants to put us to the environment by making ...
i mean , there &apos;s a lot of evidence that we have .
here &apos;s a quick video of what we do .
oh . a moment .
it might take it until it &apos;s been loaded .
now -- we can just go through that -- i &apos;ll just go through the video .
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is already over ?
okay . thanks very much .
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in technology and design , a year sabbatical , and to work in a environment that &apos;s pretty much everything that they actually hate , we have them work in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> of america .
we &apos;re going to vote every year , and we &apos;re letting them work with <unk> .
instead of sending them into the third world , we &apos;re sending them in <unk> .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban collaborators .
but what you really do is show you what &apos;s possible today with technology .
so they make al qaeda .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
this is what it looks like for a date , but what it really looks like , somebody who <unk> him when he &apos;s <unk> , because he knows it &apos;s not very good in the <unk> when he &apos;s <unk> from a meter snow .
how did he get to look for this particular way ?
last year , we had a team of fellows in boston in boston in the code for america .
they were there in february , and it has a lot of unfinished stuff in february february .
and they realized that the city never <unk> these wells .
but one of the special fellow fellow , a man named erik <unk> , even something else , and that was that the inhabitants were able to <unk> the sidewalks in front of these parts .
so he did what everybody would do good developers , he wrote an app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
you <unk> to him when it supports you .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al qaeda .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can take it off .
so there &apos;s a nice little game .
this is a very humble little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of 21 apps that have written the fellows in the last year .
but she does something that doesn &apos;t do any other <unk> .
it &apos;s moving away .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> <unk> of the city , who &apos;s seen that he could use this app , not for snow , but for the citizens to adopt their citizens .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> work , but people steal the batteries .
so he got the citizens to check them .
and then seattle seattle , the app , to use the app to get the citizens to clean up the <unk> .
and chicago has just been introduced to the people the <unk> when it melts .
we know nine cities that are planning to use this app .
and it turns out , organically , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know it doesn &apos;t usually go like that .
the <unk> of software are usually a few years .
we had a team that was working on a project project in boston for the three of these three and a half months .
it was about a way of dealing with the parents , which is the right public schools for their children .
it was told later that when it would go about the normal canals , it would have taken over two years , and it would have taken over two million dollars .
and that &apos;s not even anything .
now , there &apos;s a project at the present scale , which is about two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so , an app that &apos;s written in a few days and then moves by <unk> , is a kind of shot front of the bow to the institution of the government .
it shows how government could work better -- not like a private company , how many people think they should think .
and not even like a <unk> , but rather like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which is open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more importantly , it &apos;s a new generation that represents the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and that &apos;s a very good news , because it turns out we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
now , there &apos;s a great community of people that make the tools we need to make things that we need to do in common .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , &quot; there are hundreds of people around the country looking up and <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they didn &apos;t kill the government .
they &apos;re very frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about , they repair them .
and these people know something that we lost from the eyes .
and that &apos;s when you all of your feelings about politics and the snake in the <unk> , and all the other things that we really care about , is government , in the core of tim o , and in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what do we do in common we can &apos;t do . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of people living the government .
and if you &apos;re one of these people , i ask you that you &apos;re talking about it , because things are changing .
politics doesn &apos;t change ; the government is in change .
and because the government finally gets rid of us -- <unk> you , &quot; we &apos;re the people ? &quot; -- how do we think about how that change happens .
i didn &apos;t know much about government as i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought this was primarily about choosing people in a foreign office .
now , after two years , i &apos;ve come to the conclusion that it &apos;s primarily about intervention to <unk> .
that &apos;s the call for service and information .
that &apos;s where you typically get out of your city in your city .
if you ever have the chance to work in your <unk> call , like our fellow fellow scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to do all the -- you &apos;re going to see that people , the government to call a lot of different problems , including that there &apos;s a <unk> in your house .
scott is going to get this <unk> .
he &apos;s called &quot; <unk> &quot; into the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have an idea . he begins with the <unk> .
and then he said , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house and see very loud music and see if the livestock is <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . applause for scott .
but that was not the end of the <unk> .
boston has not only a call center .
it has an app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t write that app .
this is a very clever people at the office of new urban <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is an egyptian report -- came in : &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . can &apos;t tell if she &apos;s dead .
how do i get them away from ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
scott sets copies of human beings .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is all right , so everyone can see it .
and in this case , it saw a neighbor .
and the next post that we received was , &quot; i went there , found the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes . alive ? <unk> .
turned the <unk> on the site . go home .
great night , sweetheart <unk> . &quot;
very simple .
that &apos;s great . this is where the digital digital is the physical .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going into the <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t really mean a technical definition of platform .
i &apos;ll talk more about a platform for people to help themselves and help others .
a citizens helped another citizen , but the government was playing an central role .
they &apos;re connected to these two people .
and you would have been able to connect them with government services , if they had been needed , but a neighbor is a much better and cheaper alternative to corrupt services .
when a neighbor helps to help other people , we strengths our communities .
let &apos;s put the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is we need to think that government isn &apos;t the same as politics .
and most people understand that , but they think that &apos;s one of the input of the other .
that our contribution to the system is .
how many of you have taken a political leaders -- and sometimes we have a lot of energy to vote for a new political leaders -- and then we lean back , and we &apos;re expected that the government to reflect our values and our needs , and then hasn &apos;t changed much ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a wider ocean and politics that are the supreme court .
and what &apos;s underneath is what we call bureaucracy .
and we use this word with these contempt .
but it &apos;s these contempt that we own , and for that we &apos;re paying for , something that works against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to us , we have to make bureaucracy sexy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we don &apos;t need to put ourselves on the machinery of government .
so the <unk> did it .
did you see these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of early citizens who wrote a very detailed <unk> report , which is an answer to the <unk> of the <unk> .
that &apos;s not political active , which is <unk> active .
now , for those of us who have given governance , it &apos;s time we think about it , about the world we want to leave our kids .
you have to introduce you the enormous challenges that you have to confront .
do we really do that we &apos;re achieving what we have to achieve without an institution that can be used in the names of all of us ?
the government is absolutely necessary , but it needs to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology makes it possible that the function of the government is fundamentally <unk> in a way that can actually achieve something by using society .
and there &apos;s a generation that &apos;s grown up on the internet , and the knows that it &apos;s not so hard to do things together , you need to just build the right systems .
now the average age of our expertise is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost a generation than most of them .
this is a generation that grew up to see their voice as granted .
they &apos;re not fighting that battle we all fight to talk about who are talking ; they all allowed to talk .
you can put your mind on every channel at every channel , and you do it .
so , if you &apos;re going to be faced with the government of government , you don &apos;t care about using your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that improves the government of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to enhance our communities .
that might be a fire hydrant , <unk> , a <unk> with a <unk> display .
and surely , we could have these facilities out of all the time , and a lot of people do that .
but these apps are like little digital memories that we &apos;re not only consumers , and we &apos;re not only consumers of government paying taxes and benefits .
we &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to make government better until we improve the citizenship .
so the question i &apos;ve all shown for you all here : when it comes to the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , we will only be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
most of my role is to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are at the end , and i thought to myself , because i &apos;m under friends , i would tell you what i really think , and i &apos;m trying to look back and understand what &apos;s going on here , with these incredible <unk> , which so quickly happens .
i &apos;m going to start with you just briefly a single , boring slide .
i want you to just give the slide for a moment .
this is a slide that i &apos;d randomly picked up from my folder .
i &apos;m not about the details of the slide , but rather the overall shape .
this slide shows a analysis of us about the performance of <unk> processors with the performance of a <unk> area .
now , the interesting thing here is that this slide , like so many others , which we often are in our field , a kind of straight curve .
in other words , every step here is at the end of a desert in the <unk> .
and that &apos;s an awful lot that we have to use this type of scale on <unk> curves in technology in technology .
a very curious thing happened here .
this is basically what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you ask the light back up again .
something else , because i &apos;m going to draw something on the paper here .
now why do we draw graphs in the technology on <unk> curves ?
and the reason for that is , if i would draw it to a normal curve , where , let &apos;s say that &apos;s the years , so the timeline of one species , and this is an ongoing inversion of technology that i want to show with a graphs , and then the interesting silly .
they look like this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to share a different technology , let &apos;s say a <unk> , and then it would be very <unk> in the <unk> scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this , it changes the <unk> scheme .
so , when the sailors would grow as quickly as the <unk> material , we could go into a cab and be in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but that &apos;s not that quick .
that was never before in the history of <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is changing the light every few years .
so the question i want to ask you now is if you look at these exponential curves , you &apos;re going to go on .
it &apos;s not possible that everything goes through forever and forever as quickly as now .
there are two ways .
either it &apos;s going to be a classic <unk> like this , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
that &apos;s something like that .
now , i &apos;m an optimist , so i think , in the way that this is going to happen .
is that true , it means we &apos;re in the right place in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the present world to a new kind of world .
so the question i want to make is i want to ask myself , and i also have a lot of questions about how this new world is going to be ?
what &apos;s this new state that goes through the world ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing , when you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a child , the future was somewhere in 2000 , and people talked about what would happen in the year 2000 .
now we have a conference here , where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still in 2000 .
beyond that we &apos;re not going to go .
so in other words , the future has shrunk every year since i was in this world .
and i think the reason for that is we realize that there &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
the transition is happening . we can all feel it .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense to try and see 30 or 50 years into the future , because everything is going to be so different from what we &apos;re doing now to make no sense .
now , i want to talk about what that might be , this transition where we are right now .
and to do that i first talk about a few other things that are really nothing to do with technology or computers .
because i can really understand that , we need to go back a step back and look at the thing on a longer scale .
and that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to look at on the <unk> of the earth .
i think the sound makes sense , if you look at it in a few <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and we have 2.5 billion years ago , the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> with lots of chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , it gives us a pretty good image about how it &apos;s called the <unk> .
i think there are theories that are starting to understand how everything has started with rna , but i &apos;m going to tell you a simplified story of what &apos;s going on , that at that time , there &apos;s little <unk> <unk> , which is a different kind of <unk> of chemicals for chemicals .
some of these <unk> contain a special combination of chemicals that allow them to integrate other chemicals from outside the outside and to grow .
all of these were like that , gradually began .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> .
but those <unk> were not about living in today &apos;s , because every single one of them was just a small , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time it shared , it turns out to be <unk> chemicals into disparate amounts .
so each <unk> was a little different .
in fact , the <unk> , which is one for the growth of growth faster than others and more , more and more chemicals from the outside and shared faster .
so this is the key to survive longer , and they put it in <unk> .
so , that &apos;s just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting , if these <unk> make a trick on abstraction .
in some way , which we haven &apos;t quite understand yet , these <unk> are the ability to learn , information .
they have learned to store the recipe of the cell as information , in a particular chemical shape , which we call dna .
in other words , you have been in this <unk> , evolutionary way of a way that allowed them to be able to put them in , so that this information could be stored and copied .
and the amazing part is that this kind of information has been able to store the information about the time of a billion years ago where it was created .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from exactly the same code and the same area .
and every living organism is using the exact same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re in fact that we can write , just to the <unk> , the way that code can write in that code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to hold back in airports from <unk> .
in fact , what i did is , i took this code -- the code is from normal letters , which we use to the <unk> -- and i &apos;ve written my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i &apos;ve done it 10 ^ 22 times .
so if somebody wants a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i have enough for everyone in this room , and even for everyone in this world , and it &apos;s right here .
if i was actually a <unk> , i would have written it to a virus and put it in the room .
so what &apos;s the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then another , very interesting step , where things were completely different , so these cells started to communicate and exchange information so that communities developed by cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually replace their dna .
and that &apos;s why , for example , the consistency is growing to antibiotics .
some bacteria figured out how they can stay from penicillin , and they have this information together with other bacteria into the dna , and now we have a bunch of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin because the bacteria communicate each other .
now , this communication is allowed for the reasons of communities that were in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they survived all together , or they were going through , which meant that if a community was successful , all individuals were repeated , all the individuals of the community were repeated and by evolution .
the <unk> is now where these communities are so close that they &apos;re determined to write the recipe for the entire community into a <unk> of the dna .
and the next interesting stage took about another billion years .
at that time we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which together together as a single organism .
in fact , we are also a such community community .
we have lots of cells that are not allowed to put themselves on .
their skin cells are useless without heart disease , muscle cells , etc . and so on .
so , these communities started <unk> , so the layer that evolution occurred , no longer the single cell was the single cell , but the whole <unk> , which we call the organism .
now , the next step is now within these communities .
the <unk> started to get information .
and they developed special structures that didn &apos;t make anything else than the information inside of the organism .
and these are the neural structures .
so the neurons are the <unk> that have built these <unk> .
they began to help specialists within the community , special structures , which are responsible for learning , understanding , and capturing information .
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities .
this gave them a evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , one individual -- learning happened now within the decades of a single organism , rather than that evolutionary time .
so , an organism could learn for example , not to eat a particular principal , because they drink badly and make him sick , the last time he eaten it .
now , that could happen within the lifetime of a single organism , whereas from hundreds of thousands of years , because this information had to be adopted by the individuals who died because of these <unk> because these <unk> were not present yet .
so , the nervous system , this is the <unk> technique in this particular molecule , because evolution could now happen within a single event .
it could happen inside of a <unk> .
what happened after that , is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
for example , as an example , the <unk> version of these <unk> is human language .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing invention , when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and sweet idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and i &apos;m basically <unk> notes of myself in hopes with a similar <unk> idea in your head , which has a resemblance to my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , transform it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the head of others .
so this is allowing us to work again as a broken organism .
and what we did in fact , we humanity , is we started to touch .
we &apos;re going through the same stages that have gone rampant -- the abstraction of our methods , how we hold data , is process .
the invention of language was a small step in that direction .
<unk> , computers , <unk> , <unk> and so on are all of our bricks that we built in our community to allow that information .
and it connects us all together to something that is much bigger , and even able to develop faster than we were before .
so today , evolution can happen at the time of microseconds .
you &apos;ve seen <unk> little <unk> <unk> , where he showed a little bit of evolution in the <unk> program , right before your eyes .
so now we have the <unk> again .
the first steps of history i told you about , <unk> a billion years .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , is a hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , as language and so forth , less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to take a few decades .
now , the process itself moves itself and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> is the word for it -- when something is <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that affects itself .
i live on the building of computers , and i know that i &apos;m going to use the mechanism that i use to build computers , not use , without the recently regular advances in computing .
my current research is to design objects with such a high complexity , that it &apos;s impossible for me to design this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single transistor is doing in the <unk> .
it has billions of those .
what i do instead , and what &apos;s going to do with the designers of thinking , is , we &apos;re thinking about a conscience , putting these the machine , and the machine makes it something that our ability to go beyond our capabilities , better than we could ever make it .
and she does it partially , of course , which we don &apos;t even understand right now .
one way , which is especially interesting , and which i &apos;ve been used to spend recently is evolution itself .
in fact , we &apos;re installing a 3d scan in the machine , which is what &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
to give you an example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that &apos;s developed from random degrees .
we say , &quot; computer , <unk> please give a hundred million randomly groups of mine .
now , now it &apos;s now going to take off the chosen chosen chosen , put all the programs , and vote at the end of the hand , which are the closest of my lips to the nearest . &quot;
so in other words , i define first what i want .
let &apos;s say , i want to put statistics on numbers that would be a simple example of which i &apos;ve been used to that .
so , think of programs , which are most of the numbers of the numbers .
and of course , the chances of randomly elected a very small thought that you might just have number of numbers of numbers , so you probably won &apos;t be able to do that .
but one of those may be a little bit of a good number of numbers in the right order .
now i &apos;m saying , &quot; computer , take the 10 percent of the sequence now , which are the closest ones .
and then they go off , <unk> the rest .
now , all the certainties that have the number of numbers .
it &apos;s with a method of <unk> , analog to reproduction . &quot;
two programs , and they produce kids through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are missing the features of the <unk> of the two programs .
so now i have a new generation of programs that have created by combinations of programs that have something closer to the pleasures than others .
tell , &quot; please repeat this process . &quot;
<unk> her again .
so maybe a few mutations .
and try this with another generation .
all of these generations need a few milliseconds .
and so i can run a evolution over millions of years in the computer in less minutes , or in some cases , a few hours .
and finally , i finally got a second idea that can be done on the numbers of the numbers .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i would ever write by hand .
when i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i &apos;ve tried to understand them .
it &apos;s funny and odd programs .
but she did the job .
i know , i &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to do the job because it comes out of a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because their life depended on whether they did the job right .
i sat down in a 747 meeting with marvin minsky , and he <unk> a card <unk> and he said , &quot; oh look . look at that .
it &apos;s called the airplane of <unk> <unk> , which are working together to make their flight secure . &apos; doesn &apos;t you <unk> that ? &quot;
we know that a <unk> isn &apos;t going to be avoided if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to rely on computers , for a process that &apos;s very different from the classic sensitivity .
it allows us things with a much larger complexity than the regular methods would allow us to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of that yet .
so <unk> <unk> us the technique .
so , we use these programs now to make the computer much faster , so we can be able to do this processes even faster .
so it &apos;s going to be a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be faster and faster and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all of these new technologies are fed by itself .
we &apos;re going down .
we &apos;re at a point , which is analog at at the time , as a result of <unk> .
so , we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t quite yet see what the hell we &apos;re doing right now .
we &apos;re in the middle of this .
but i really do believe that after us .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> from us to say that we are the product of evolution .
and i think that all of us here are all part of the creation of whatever it &apos;s next .
now , the lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear you now before i &apos;m going to go through .
now , my story starts right here in tahrir , about two years ago .
i was under the sky in the desert , with <unk> <unk> ali .
we talked about that hasn &apos;t changed since the time of ancient indian <unk> . &quot;
when we wanted to travel indians , we put in a cart and <unk> across the sky .
now we do that with airplanes .
when the big indian <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , he got a bow , fired into the ground and water .
now we do that with <unk> and machines .
we came to the conclusion that magic and magic of machines were replaced by machines .
that was really sad to me .
i got some fear of technology .
it was afraid that i could lose the ability to enjoy the sunset without a camera and no <unk> to my friends .
i found that technology should make magic possible and not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this is a piece of old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
it became an <unk> access to a world full of pirates and <unk> ships and to images in my imagination .
i came up with this as we thought about our fancy <unk> and cameras out of it .
they kept us going to be inspired by this .
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use them to kill the magic rather than kill it .
at the age of 16 , i started to illustrate books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device to connect the readers around the world .
it can know how we hold it .
it can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sound and touch .
and that storytelling always takes more senses .
but what do we do with this ?
i just go to <unk> , an interactive ipad .
here &apos;s : &quot; put your finger on every light . &quot;
and so -- here it sits : &quot; that box heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and it &apos;s going to be a character in the book .
and again , a letter gets down for me -- and the ipad knows through gps where i live -- which is really to me .
the child in me is really enthusiastic .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i don &apos;t mean magicians and dragon , but the magic of childhood , those ideas that we all had as children .
in a glass of glass , i found all very exciting .
so you have to blow up the ipad and the fireflies hatch .
and the light bulb the way through the book .
another idea that fascinated me as a child is that a whole galaxy can be stuck in a single <unk> .
and so , here &apos;s what &apos;s going to be every book and every world , a little <unk> that i put up here to the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always been maps , but these maps were static .
and that map grows and glows , and it &apos;s going to be the orientation in the rest of the book .
it &apos;s also showing the other places of the book .
i &apos;ll go in here .
it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is also very <unk> .
these are the <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard of all of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside of india know their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were caught thousands of years into <unk> <unk> in an old book book .
and we bring them back , in a contemporary history for children .
a story working with new issues , like the <unk> .
on the subject of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids are sitting in their dorm , on their computers , without refueling .
but now with mobile technology , we can take our kids into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book you &apos;re going to be sent to a quest . you have to go out and get out with the camera of the ipads images of natural objects .
as a child , i had collections of <unk> , stones , <unk> and <unk> .
in fact , the children don &apos;t do it anymore .
this is going to be <unk> . you have to go out in a chapter a picture of a flower and tag .
in a different chapters , you have to have a piece of <unk> <unk> and mark .
that &apos;s how you create a digital collection of photographs that you can ask online .
a child in london showing the picture of a <unk> and says , &quot; oh , today i have seen a fox . &quot;
a child in india says , &quot; today i &apos;ve seen a monkey . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photographs that you actually recorded .
there &apos;s a wide variety of opportunities to combine the world and technology .
in the next book , we plan an interaction where you use the ipads of ipads , and through <unk> , you can see a animation of improvisation that appear on a plant in front of the house .
at one point , the screen is <unk> with leaves .
you have to make the sound of the aral sea , and you read it and read the rest of the book .
we &apos;re all moving to a world where the forces of technology are getting closer and in the magic and technology and technology .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our kids and us closer to the natural world , and to the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , prisons , or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social weakest in the <unk> and places where there &apos;s a lot of hopelessness .
and to see here at ted , to see and hear how widespread that was , i gave a lot of power .
in the short time , i got a clear thing : ted has a identity .
you can say things that have the world &apos;s impact .
and sometimes when something comes over ted , it gets a meaning and force that doesn &apos;t have otherwise .
i say that because i think that identity is very important .
we saw some amazing presentation .
i think we &apos;ve learned that the words of a teacher is really meaningful , but that &apos;s the words of an outrageous teacher .
as a doctor , you can do good , as a doctor , but you can do it more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t learn that as a lawyer in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i was raised big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , which was dominated by a <unk> , and that <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had damage .
she had the last word in any <unk> .
she was also the beginning of many assets in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in virginia as slaves .
she was born in 1880 , and the experience of slavery shaped very strong .
and my grandmother was strong , but she was also <unk> .
when i met her as a young boy , she came to me and <unk> me .
she <unk> me so emphatically that i could barely breathe , and then she got rid of me .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and she said , &quot; <unk> , you &apos;re feeling my embrace ? &quot;
and when i said no &quot; no &quot; said , she <unk> me . when i said , &quot; yes , she said to me .
she was something that she did was she always wanted to be close to her .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mother was the youngest of their 10 children .
sometimes , when i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to acquire their attention .
my cousins were all over the place .
i remember , i got to be eight or nine , that i woke up one morning and i went to the living room . all my cousins were around .
my grandmother sat at the end of the wheelhouse , and i was staring at myself .
first , i thought that was a game .
i looked at her and smiled , but she looked very serious .
that &apos;s about 15 or 20 minutes , and then she came up and came to me . she took me on the hand and said , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i , we need to talk . &quot;
i remember even though it was yesterday .
i &apos;ll never forget it .
she took me out and she said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;ll tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to tell you that you &apos;re not going to be <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; dear , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat down and looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to be watching . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;ll never forget that .
she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to get me just three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; okay , grandma . &quot;
she said , &quot; first of all , i thought you will always love your mommy . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mommy is my baby and you &apos;ve got to get through that you &apos;re always going to care about them . &quot;
i put my mother , so i said , &quot; yeah , grandma , i &apos;ll do that . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , next to me that you &apos;re always going to do the right thing , &quot; even though it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , &quot; yes , grandma , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
and finally she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to tell me is you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
now , i was nine years old and so i said , &quot; yes , grandma . i promise .
i grew up in the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s older and a year younger sister .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and brought this <unk> beer with grabbed my sister and i went to the forest .
we &apos;re just hanging out there as though .
then he took a drink drink and saved my sister &apos;s sister , and she assumed , and then offer me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . ok . do you . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
now , my brother said , &quot; well , you know , we &apos;re doing that , you &apos;re going to do everything we do .
i had what , your sister had something . go , <unk> a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want it . i &apos;m just going to do it . &quot;
my brother was staring at me .
he said , &quot; what &apos;s wrong with you ? well , what &apos;s going on . &quot;
and then he looked at his face , and he said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t always make you crazy about the entertainment of grandma ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandma told all of the grandchildren that she &apos;s special . &quot;
i was devastated .
i &apos;m going to give you something like that .
i should probably not do that .
this is what &apos;s going to be <unk> publicly .
i &apos;m 52 years old and i realize that i &apos;ve never had a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say that because identity is power .
if we create the right kind of identity , we can tell the people around us that they don &apos;t think initially .
we can get them to do things that they thought they were doing .
of course , my grandmother would say all their grandchildren , they &apos;re something special .
my grandfather was in prison during prison .
my uncles died of <unk> disease .
and she believed that these are the subjects that we need to do .
i &apos;ve tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
uganda were 300,000 people in <unk> and prison .
today it &apos;s 2.3 million .
the united states today have the highest incarceration rates of the world .
seven million people are <unk> , or <unk> <unk> .
and i think , in fact , the world has changed our world .
in social and black parts of the population , despair and hopelessness , because of these changes .
one of the three male black black in 18 and 30 is in prison , in prison , in prison , or <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities all across the country -- from los angeles about philadelphia , <unk> to washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all black men in prison , in prison , in jail , in jail , or <unk> .
so , our system is not only shaped by questions that have to do with <unk> , it &apos;s also going to go through poverty .
so in this country , we have a <unk> that they are much better treated when they &apos;re rich and guilty than poor and innocent .
ataturk , not <unk> , it affects the result .
and yet , we seem to be very pleased with this .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost the touch .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of woven things there .
my home of alabama , they &apos;re going to keep hollowing away , if they &apos;re going to be demolished .
now , here in alabama , 34 percent of the male black population is lost their <unk> .
we conjecture that in ten years , the coverage of the <unk> of the edits are going to be as high as the <unk> of the <unk> .
the silence is <unk> .
i <unk> kids .
many of my clients are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the children &apos;s children to death in prison .
in this country , there are children <unk> <unk> without <unk> .
we &apos;ve already run a lot of research .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the death penalty death is an interesting question .
we believe that because you &apos;ve taught us that the true question is : has a man earned to die for one of him to die ?
that &apos;s a very sensitive question .
but you can also think differently about how we see our identity .
the other view is not : did somebody make a crime death , but , did we put it to kill ?
i find that fascinating .
the death penalty in america is defined by error .
nine people we &apos;ve been executed , one that we have had been to innocent exhibitions , the <unk> and the death of death .
an amazing accusation . one of nine innocent .
i find that fascinating .
we would never fly somebody with an airplane if for nine planes , the blood vessel .
but somehow , we &apos;re going to do it by this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our burden .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i &apos;m talking a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about race , and the question is whether we have the right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting because i &apos;m teaching my students &apos; worth &apos; history . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , at the end of the <unk> , to the beginning of the two world war ii .
we don &apos;t really know much about it .
but for the african-american , in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many places , people have had to fear .
bombs .
it was the fear of terror that shaped her life .
now , the older people are coming to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , they talk , they talk about it . they tell people that they should stop saying that we should stop doing it for the first time in our nation , for the first time .
you say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after the terrorism , of course , the <unk> and decades of <unk> are motivated and apartheid .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
and so we don &apos;t really understand what the meaning of our actions have in the historical context .
we constantly poke each other .
we &apos;re always creating new tensions and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about race , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not willing to access the truth of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , the people understood that the <unk> is not too clear without the willingness to truth and reconciliation .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in that country .
i &apos;ve kept a couple of talks in germany about the death penalty .
and it was fascinating because one of the scientists came to my talk and said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s deeply troubling to hear it . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there &apos;s no death penalty .
and of course , it can never give them more . &quot;
it was silent . then a woman said , &quot; with our story , it &apos;s impossible that we ever kill ourselves for the systematic killing of people .
it would be <unk> by us , consciously and common people . &quot;
i thought about it .
and as it might feel , in a world where the german state of people would <unk> people , especially if there were a lot of jewish ones .
it would have been fixed .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in the states of the old testament , we get people -- here is the risk of death , 11 times higher , when the victim is white , than when it &apos;s black . 22 times higher , when the <unk> black is black and the victim -- in the same states , the bodies of <unk> people are .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is threatened .
when we &apos;re not dealing with these difficult issues , then the positive and wonderful things are afflicted .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but then finally , these realities are going to be suffering from sorry , abuse , <unk> .
i think it &apos;s important to unite both .
because we &apos;re ultimately talking about that we need more hope , more engagement , more dedication , to be able to be in a complex world .
for me , it means time for me , thinking and talk about the poor , the disadvantaged , the ones that never be at ted .
but think of it in a way that is embedded in our own lives .
we all have to believe things that we can &apos;t see .
we do that . so we &apos;re doing so much , we &apos;re worthy of intellect .
innovation , creativity , and development is not only coming out of our heads .
they come from ideas that are driven by the believers in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i think that you make us not just open for all the bright and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great lexicographer politician , once said .
as we flew across eastern europe , we wanted to do all sorts of things , but what we needed most was hope , a devastating orientation , the willingness to be , sometimes in <unk> places , and witness . &quot;
this intellectual orientation is the core of what i think is that , as well as the research agency has to do it .
there &apos;s no line around technology and design that allows us to be more human and more human , as long as we don &apos;t have eyes and ears , and injustice .
i want to warn you . this kind of identity is very much more of us than if we don &apos;t understand ourselves .
she &apos;s going to deeply touch it .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the great privilege to meet pink parks .
once came back to <unk> , where they had two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , who had the <unk> <unk> -- an incredible <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white , a husband , whose husband , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk> <unk> . &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp;
so these women met and looked at it .
and then , a woman named ms. <unk> me and said , &quot; <unk> , ms. parks is coming into the city . we want to talk to ourselves .
do you want to <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , very happy . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do if you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;ll listen . &quot;
and i went over and i was just hearing .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
and one day i sat there , and after a few hours a few hours after a few hours , woman came up to me and said , &quot; well , let me tell you what the initiative is .
what are they trying to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to go beyond injustice .
<unk> people want to help people who were convicted .
we want to fight and discrimination in the <unk> .
we want to abolish <unk> <unk> without <unk> <unk> for children .
we want to do something about the death penalty .
we want to reduce the number of girls .
we want to abolish <unk> . &quot;
i gave my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; that &apos;s going to be very , very tired . &quot;
and then lady <unk> <unk> to me , putting a finger on my face and said , &quot; and that &apos;s why they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted should be <unk> .
we need to be able to confront ways of asking these challenges , these problems , that sorry .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on all of our humanity .
in my work , i learned very simple things .
i &apos;ve learned a couple of simple things .
we &apos;re all more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for every human being on the planet .
when somebody says , it &apos;s not just a liar .
when someone takes something that doesn &apos;t heard him , it &apos;s not just a burglar .
even who kills someone is not just a killers .
and because that &apos;s like that , there &apos;s a basic human dignity that has to respect the law .
i believe that in many parts of this country , with safety in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i think in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that even though she &apos;s so dramatic , so beautiful and inspiring , and so forth , we &apos;re not going to be measured in our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not to the things that we &apos;re developing , not on our intellect and minds .
after all , a society is not going to be treated how they are rich and powerful and privileged and privileged and privileged , but how they handle with the poor , the <unk> .
because in that context , we start to understand the real amazing things that make us .
sometimes i really appreciate that balance . a story to conclude .
sometimes i make too much .
i &apos;m tired of how we all .
sometimes these ideas are ahead of our thinking , in very important ways .
i <unk> these kids who were sentenced to very hard sentences .
i go to the <unk> and visit a client , which may be 13 or 14 years old , and who &apos;s supposed to be as an adult in court .
then i ask myself , how could this happen ?
how can a judge make someone into something that he isn &apos;t ?
the judge looks at him as adults , but i see a child .
one night , i stayed up for a long time , and i thought , oh my gosh , if a judge can transform us into something else , then he has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should also be asking for them .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t really think of it right , i started working on a bill .
i had a <unk> , poor young boy as a client .
and i started with this bill . the headline said , &quot; well , my poor , <unk> black user as a privileged , white , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i explained that there was ownership of the <unk> and the police and the police as well as <unk> .
there was a crazy line about that , in this country , there &apos;s nothing that there is no longer any cases .
the next morning i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was only hearing this crazy assessment or actually had written it .
and to my horror , i didn &apos;t write it , but i was speaking to the court .
a few months after , and i was just going to forget it .
but , finally , i decided , my god , i got to put into the court , and this crazy case .
i got into the car , and i was really overwhelmed -- overwhelmed .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that this is going to be so hard .
eventually , i went from my car , and i went up the stairs to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was an elderly , black man , the janitors in the court .
when he saw me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; you &apos;re lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came to me and <unk> me .
then he whispered me to the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud to you . &quot;
and i have to say , there &apos;s no force .
it &apos;s got something very deep in me , identity , the ability to contribute to a community , to a culture of hope .
now , i went to the <unk> .
once the judge looked at me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you put this crazy assessment ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to debate .
more people came in , just because they were angry .
that i wrote that crazy stuff .
<unk> came in and <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
in the <unk> , the <unk> of people who were angry were that we talked about skin thinking about skin , about poverty , about inequality .
from my <unk> , i saw the janitors down and down .
he looked through the window through the window and could hear all the <unk> .
he went up and down .
eventually , this older black guy came with a very energetic <unk> in the <unk> , and he sat straight in front of me , almost on the <unk> .
ten minutes later , the judge announced a break .
during the break , a <unk> came in , which it was meant that the janitors was in the <unk> .
this <unk> ran over to the older black .
he said , &quot; jimmy , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood up . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m here to tell you that young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal . don &apos;t give up .
i came to ted , because i think that many of you have understood that the moral council of the universe is far away , but that it &apos;s the justice of justice .
we &apos;re not completely evolved as humans , as long as we don &apos;t care about human rights and <unk> .
that our entire survival is all more connected to each of us .
we have to connect our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , compassion and justice .
and in spite of all , i &apos;d like to tell you , just to say , don &apos;t you lose the goal of your eyes . don &apos;t give up .
you have seen this audience , this community , a obvious wish , and heard of them to help them and do something .
what can we do to do that ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there &apos;s opportunities everywhere .
when you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> where it &apos;s going to be that , actually , a effort to companies , something from the <unk> <unk> , which is in the politics of the punishment .
so , here in california , for example , you &apos;ll be a billion dollars for the death penalty , a billion dollars .
and yet , 46 percent of all <unk> don &apos;t belong with a <unk> .
<unk> percent of all of americans don &apos;t come in front of court .
there &apos;s the opportunity to do something .
this is what &apos;s going to be like to invest in more <unk> and safety .
i think there are opportunities everywhere .
during the last three decades , the <unk> is <unk> in america .
that fact is often put in context with the passenger pigeon .
what would you tell somebody who thinks that ?
well , in fact , the number of <unk> didn &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country doesn &apos;t really found in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
so the dramatic numbers are coming to the test .
we &apos;ve questioned ourselves from the rhetoric of punishment .
now , we have &quot; <unk> , &quot; which is the people who are always behind bars , for a <unk> , for the theft of good , rather than that you force it , the things that sacrifice sacrifice .
i think we need to do more to help people who have become victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i believe that our current facts is not allowed to do anything .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve really got a translator here , you know .
they &apos;re a inspirational personality .
thank you for coming to ted . thank you very much .
bin death is a risk of collision .
two : famine in somalia , at 3 : spray of the police .
at 4 : <unk> <unk> . i think five : dangerous <unk> .
six : social mania . so seven : 65 dead .
at 8 : <unk> . speaker 9 : <unk>
other speakers : <unk> . weapons . tornado .
peer-to-peer . 1990 . <unk> . egypt . syria .
crisis . death . catastrophe .
oh my god .
so , these are just a few of clips i &apos;ve collected over the last six months -- it could have been the last six days , or the last six years .
in fact , the media is to show us negative topics , because our minds are going to be using these subjects .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for that .
every second every every day , our senses are able to grow much more information than our brain .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first charter for all the information is part of our <unk> , the amygdala .
so the amygdala is our early warning , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> all the information on the ground for any kind of risk of danger in our environment .
so when we see the news , we prefer to look at negative news .
and the old adage , &quot; when it comes out , the demand is very true .
now , with all our digital devices , the week , 24 hours a day , all of these negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we &apos;re pessimistic .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks it &apos;s always worse .
but maybe it &apos;s not the case .
perhaps that &apos;s the reality .
perhaps the enormous amount of progress we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces , so strong that it &apos;s possible for us to create a world of saving .
now , i &apos;m not suggesting that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate crisis , <unk> , water and <unk> -- we have already .
and as humans , we are much better at doing problems in a very long view of time , but they ended up with .
let &apos;s look at what we &apos;ve reached in the last century so that we can approach the development .
over the last 100 years , the average life expectancy has been more than doubled , which is the inflation of ancient greek the world &apos;s population has tripled .
it &apos;s about a tenth of energy .
it &apos;s because the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and communications costs have been adjusted by a mere <unk> .
in fact , we &apos;ve shown that we live in a very peaceful period of time .
and unfortunately , charles <unk> is the <unk> in the past 130 years of 25 percent in 80 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and a lot of people forget that .
and we increase our expectations all the time .
in fact , we &apos;ve redefined poverty .
if you think that a large percentage of americans that live under poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , roads , tv , etc . , etc .
the richest capitalists of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never be able to have these <unk> .
the basis of a lot of these kinds of technologies , and these are growing up .
now , my good friend ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to information technology , on the curve of moore &apos;s law , and the average likelihood is doubling every 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s how the mobile phone is about a million times less , less than a supercomputer from the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law for the last hundred years .
put two things on this curve .
one , how economies are going to be -- in good places , in the bad time , war or peace , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers that build operational computers .
it slowed down for none of our big problems .
in spite of their logarithmic <unk> on the left , it &apos;s moving upwards .
so the rate of self is speeding up .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available .
&quot; <unk> &quot; , something that my friends at autodesk in autodesk &quot; <unk> , &quot; sensors and networks , robots that allow us to democratize the personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> and <unk> , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have seen the victory of <unk> supercomputer on &quot; risk ? &quot;
that was a great thing to do .
i &apos;ve been looking for the newspapers and looking for the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human adversary . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; isn &apos;t a simple game .
it &apos;s about understanding the nuances of language .
imagine that these artificial intelligence would have been given to each of the <unk> .
four years ago , ray kurzweil , and i was here at ted a new university called singularity university .
we bring our students all of these technologies with special focus on how these can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students to create businesses , products and services that are positively correlated with people &apos;s lives of billions of people .
if you think about that , a group of students today can impact the lives of billions of people .
thirty years ago , this was ridiculous .
today we can look at dozens of companies that have done exactly that .
when i think of making surplus , i don &apos;t mean a life of luxury for everyone on the planet ; it &apos;s about making a life of opportunities .
it &apos;s about adding hormones surplus .
as it is , it &apos;s <unk> , and technology is a resources of the force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy on the left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers got <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but the king of <unk> but got <unk> .
twenty-three was the most valuable metal on the planet , more powerful than gold and <unk> .
this is why the dome of the <unk> of aluminum was made of aluminum .
although , aluminum <unk> percent of the <unk> , it &apos;s not going to be as a pure metal .
it &apos;s connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology of technology developed and made <unk> so cheap that we use it with our <unk> .
then , let &apos;s put that analogy into the future .
we &apos;re thinking about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet which is filled with more energy than we used to use .
16 percent of energy is <unk> all the attributes of the earth &apos;s surface .
it &apos;s not about legitimacy , the problem is .
and there are good news .
this year , you &apos;ve been able to get it for the first time , in india &apos;s cost to 50 percent of the fuel efficiency -- <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees .
the cost of solar fell last year at 50 percent .
and last month , this is published with a trial that shows that until the end of this decade , in the sunny parts of the united states , are six cents per square inch , compared to 15 cents in national average or 15 cents in national average .
and if we have a <unk> , we &apos;ll also have water in the surplus .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
remember , as carl sagan the <unk> 1990 , when it was on saturn , back into the ground heading back towards earth ?
he took a famous photo . how did it be ?
&quot; a <unk> blue physicist . &quot;
because we live on a carbon-neutral life .
we live on a planet that &apos;s covered 70 percent of water .
yes , it &apos;s 2,200 percent of saltwater , two percent are <unk> , and we fight to fight percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean <unk> , one of the innovators of the <unk> , i &apos;d like to share with you , i &apos;d like to share with you the permission -- he gave me the authorization -- his <unk> , the &quot; <unk> , &quot; and many of you may have heard of it . it &apos;s got the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can create a thousand liters per day of different sources -- whether saltwater , polluted water , latrine -- and all that &apos;s less than two cents per gallon .
the <unk> of coca-cola has just been <unk> , a large <unk> with a hundred units in developing countries .
and when all goes well , i &apos;m very confident , so coca-cola will apply that technology globally in <unk> countries on the entire planet .
this is barricelli innovation that are today .
and we &apos;ve seen that in mobile phones .
i mean , we &apos;re going to reach the 70 percent <unk> of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of 2013 .
just consider a cell phone in the middle of kenya in the middle of kenya , a better child mortality , as president reagan 25 years ago .
and if you look at it with your smartphone on google , you have more access to knowledge and you have information as president clinton 15 years ago .
they live in a world that has information and communication , how no one could ever predict .
and it &apos;s better , the things that you do , and i &apos;ve spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photo , with the books and the music , to medical imaging imaging -- literally <unk> and cheaper in your cell phone .
and the best part is probably what &apos;s going on in health .
last month i had the pleasure , with the <unk> that so-called &quot; $ 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize . &quot;
we &apos;ve got teams all over the world , all of these technologies in an mobile phone , that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s with ai , you can <unk> <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , it has to be a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there are no doctors , but 25 percent of the staff &apos;s staff and 1.3 percent of the employees of healthcare education .
when this device is a <unk> or a <unk> , which is not known , it &apos;s called a <unk> , and it &apos;s got a pandemic in front of their outbreak .
but now to the biggest force that &apos;s going to lead us to a world of excess .
i call them &quot; the coming billion . &quot;
the white lines are for population .
we &apos;ve just crossed the <unk> .
and only by the way , the biggest <unk> against one population is a better education and food in the world .
in 2010 , we had just connected to two billion people with each other .
by 2020 , we climb from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new ones we never heard of before , the global communication is going to go .
what do these people need ?
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to fight ?
and instead of creating gridlock , i see one of the greatest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent several trillion trillion dollars that will flow into the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be used by using the use of <unk> , and they get better trained by the <unk> , and by changing the opportunity to become 3d and more productive than ever before , as much more than ever before .
so what &apos;s going to be three billion growing , healthy , educated , productive members of <unk> ?
now , how about a sentence , never before <unk> .
how would it be like that , wherever you &apos;re going to be a voice to make payments attention and change change , for the first time ?
what are they going to bring these three billion people ?
how about <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through x transformation is that little teams that are motivated by rights and focus are motivated to create extraordinary things , things that can make big businesses and governments only create in the past .
i want to close with a story that really excites me .
there &apos;s a program that some might know .
it &apos;s a game called the grass .
it was developed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids to study how the protein is going to develop .
and as soon as we can , we can predict the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
it was a problem of supercomputer &apos;s problems .
and this game was played by professors .
and it &apos;s hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that , today , the human constitution better than the best supercomputer , as the best supercomputer .
and when these people came and looked at who &apos;s the best culinary story of the world , it was not a <unk> , it was someone who was a woman who was a woman who was a woman who was working on the day of the <unk> in a <unk> , and at night the best <unk> of the world was .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me exquisite confidence in our future is the fact that we have more power than individuals to confront the great challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with technology .
we have the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we have three billion new ones we can work online with the new challenges , and to do that , and to do that .
we &apos;re expecting a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i think we need to do something about a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it &apos;s going to be with a physician and that &apos;s me .
and maybe i &apos;m a long time in business , as i can allow me to give it a piece of my own <unk> <unk> to allow that .
but before i get to the actual issue of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re close to the <unk> , and we &apos;re moving to the world .
we all love baseball , right ?
plate is full of great statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; seems to be about statistics and to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to show you a statistic i &apos;m hoping that most of you have heard of it .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the aral sea .
we &apos;re talking about a 300 when a bat hits .
that means that the player will secure three of 10 beats .
it &apos;s called the ball , it &apos;s coming on , it &apos;s not going to be caught , and who &apos;s trying to throw the ball to the first base , it hasn &apos;t been done in time , and the street was in safety .
three of 10 10 .
do you know how you &apos;re called a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how you call a <unk> ?
this is somebody who &apos;s safe to do four out of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> baseball <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> over 400 times .
let &apos;s go back into my world of medicine , where i feel about a lot less , or maybe a little less likely after i talked to you about it .
if you have a <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be a <unk> milestone , which is 400 400 in terms of <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
put them living in a particular remote area , and they have a beloved people with <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk> to a <unk> , which is <unk> at age 200 .
but , you know what ?
it &apos;s a lot better . it &apos;s on the cutting edge .
and she proposes a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse , an <unk> , should you be a <unk> ?
king , very good .
the truth is that no one &apos;s going to be a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor .
what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re going to be able to make me translate into the world with the aspiration of perfect .
never make a mistake , but no one &apos;s going to do the details of how this is going to be done .
and that &apos;s the message that i ingest in medical school .
i was a <unk> student student .
in high school , a state said that brian <unk> would learn to be a <unk> .
and that &apos;s how it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> in the house in the days of general <unk> at the toronto of general hospital , <unk> by here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and the <unk> of each car , every branch of each artery , which is from the aorta <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> to classify <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that time , i was able to know more and more .
and i was good , i was with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the explanation with the impression that i had , if i knew everything i knew , and it knew everything , or at least as much as possible , as close as possible , as close as possible , i was making immune function .
and it worked for awhile for a time , until i met woman .
i was <unk> on a <unk> <unk> in toronto , as a woman , to me , was brought into the <unk> of the hospital .
at that time , i was the most <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my assignment as the <unk> <unk> advice to investigate the <unk> .
and to give it to my <unk> .
i looked at ms. woman and she was in <unk> .
and when i listened to her , she made <unk> sounds .
and when i was feeding your breast with the <unk> <unk> , i was able to hear an <unk> sound on both sides , which told me that she was suffering under <unk> heart disease .
this is a state where the heart is failing , instead of pumping the entire blood and a part of the blood in the lung and filling those gradually , so the <unk> .
and that was not a <unk> diagnosis .
i put them on , and i started to give it to the treatment .
i gave her <unk> . i gave her medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water pills , so they <unk> the liquid .
and over a five-year period of one to two hours , they started feeling better .
i felt really good .
and then i took my first mistake ; i sent them home .
in fact , i did two mistakes .
i sent them home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t take the receiver , and i did what i should have , which was a call in my <unk> , so that he had a chance to have a chance to make a sense of the face of his own image . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and he knew it , he would have been able to have extra information to her <unk> .
maybe i was doing it with good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so successful that i was so worried that i was so worried , and so i would be able to do it for my patients without trying to contact him .
my second mistake was worse .
that &apos;s what i sent them home , i <unk> a little voice in mine who tried to say to me , &quot; dig , no good idea . don &apos;t do that . &quot;
in fact , it was very <unk> to me that i asked the nurse , which was a woman &apos;s worth of wife , &quot; do you think that &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it and said in <unk> ways , &quot; yeah , i think it will be good . &quot;
i remember this as if it was yesterday .
so i got the <unk> and a ambulances and a <unk> and i got them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest of the day , i had this <unk> feeling in my belly .
but i was working on .
and at the end of the day i took my things , i got my things , and i went to the hospital to drive home with the car , when i did something i didn &apos;t .
i went home by the <unk> on my way home .
and there was another nurse , not the sister who had seen this after ms. , but another three words to me and those three words , most of the <unk> i know .
other doctors fear that too , but the <unk> is particularly particularly because we see the patients just as fleeting .
now , the three words , remember ?
&quot; remember the patients you turned home home ? &quot;
did the nurse shut .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular book .
so she was back .
she was back and dying .
about an hour after she got home , after i got home to her home , she <unk> , and the family used to be 911 , and the <unk> brought them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
they were barely sleeping and was blue <unk> .
the <unk> is all strands .
they gave her <unk> .
she put them on the <unk> .
i was shocked to go to the interior <unk> .
and i found that rollercoaster , because she came to the <unk> and i hoped that she would be going to recover .
and after two , three days realized that she would never check again .
she didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
their family copies .
and over the course of eight or nine days , they went to the <unk> .
on the shuttle day , they go to -- ms. printer , a woman , a mother and grandmother .
you say that you never forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i learned this .
the next weeks i took myself , and i learned that , for the first time , the most unhealthy shame that exists in our medical culture -- i felt alone , isolated , not the kind of healthy shame that you feel because you don &apos;t talk to the colleagues about it .
you all know the healthy shame , if you give a secret of the greatest friend award , even though that one on <unk> <unk> , and then you get caught and the best friend will have to have a deal with it , and when you end up with you , you can &apos;t make one of these errors , you know , you &apos;re never going to make one of these errors .
if you look at <unk> and you never do it again .
that &apos;s the kind of <unk> shame .
the unhealthy way i &apos;m talking about is the ones that make you sick in the heart .
it &apos;s the one that tells you that not what you &apos;re doing is bad , but you have bad yourself .
and that was what i felt .
and it was not based on my <unk> , it was very gentle .
he was talking to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he &apos;s got rid of him and secure that i didn &apos;t have sued to be sued .
but i was asking these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why am i going to go home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make such a stupid mistake ?
why am i left in medicine ?
but surely , surely it turned out .
i started feeling better .
and then on a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds , and the sun broke up , and i might tell myself , maybe i can feel better again .
and i was with me that if i had put my efforts to the berlin , and never again a mistake , that the voice could be <unk> .
and she did .
and i was working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had a service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto and i was offering a 25 year-old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of los , and i was in a hurry .
he always showed up here .
i looked into the <unk> , and it was a little pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and he would wait him .
and even when he went out of the door , he showed up on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to a conversation in her office .
and she said the three words : remember you ?
&quot; remember the patients with the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out it &apos;s a <unk> .
he had a potentially <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can click the google , but it &apos;s not a infection , but it &apos;s the top of the <unk> and causing the benefits of the <unk> .
luckily , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> and recovered , a few days later .
and i went back through the same genealogy of shame and self-doubt , i felt <unk> , and i went to work on the work until it happened again and again .
in a <unk> , i have two times a <unk> .
there &apos;s a lot of that , especially if you think you &apos;re working in a hospital , that &apos;s only 14 patients per night .
in both cases , i didn &apos;t wait them home , and i don &apos;t have any imperfections in their treatment .
at one point , i thought it would have been <unk> .
i put the x-ray of the kidneys , and when it was without <unk> , my colleague was a <unk> in the lower right-hand sector , and called the <unk> .
the other one had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> , and i asked my colleagues too .
and that &apos;s what he did when he was a <unk> in the right of the right sector , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , they were <unk> , and they were good at it .
both of cases <unk> me , <unk> me .
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors happened only in the first five years , which was a lot of my colleagues , but total nonsense .
i &apos;ve happened in the last five years .
so , without support , without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t finish with my errors and talk about them , if i tell the little voice that tells me what really did not find , how can i share it with my colleague ?
how can i teach them my errors so that they don &apos;t do the same commit ?
if i got into a room -- like now , i have no idea what you &apos;re thinking about me .
when &apos;s the last time you heard of somebody &apos;s last time talking about <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and you like to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about your own mistakes .
when i was in a room full of millions of times , and in order to help their <unk> , and to tell you what i &apos;d just told you about , i would probably never achieve the end of the second story before you really get rid of it , and you would forget the issue and forget the rest .
and in fact , when i knew , or my colleague , there was a <unk> in my hospital , who would have lost the wrong leg , then i think i would have trouble to look at it into the eyes .
that &apos;s the system that we live in .
it &apos;s a totally denial of errors .
it &apos;s a system where there are two basic positions -- the ones that make errors and the ones that don &apos;t make . the ones that are <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and the ones that are with bad outcomes .
it &apos;s almost a devastating response as antibodies that attack a man .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we have the ones that make mistakes , we have a secure system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of medical research and journalism , i had a personal medical study about medical errors and absolute procedures to do so much for one of my first papers , which i was on for the toronto to my show , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; was writing .
and what i learned is that errors are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re going to work in a system where one of the 10 <unk> are either a false or wrong <unk> , where <unk> is always <unk> and all the time and a destruction or a dead or dead .
in this state , about 24,000 canadians of <unk> errors .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is the number of medicine in 100,000 .
they &apos;re really strong , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as exactly as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in a <unk> in which that medical medical care is doubling every two to three years , we can &apos;t keep up .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we own a cognitive errors so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient with chest .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , making it <unk> and <unk> , and then you give it a light <unk> breath , and all of a sudden , the story is <unk> with contempt .
i don &apos;t take the same trend .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patients are no cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms , they don &apos;t always tell me their symptoms .
all of these are actually errors .
so when you take the system as it &apos;s been taught , as i was taught it , all the <unk> <unk> add off , then at the end , there &apos;s no longer left .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , &quot; i &apos;ve got the habit of saying , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say to each of the <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> , &quot; this is my worst mistake &quot; blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . &quot;
and then you expand your pupils , you &apos;re struck in front of your head , you look down and eat down , and you start telling your stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake that i &apos;m referring to . &quot;
what you need is an environment that is able to do it .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new political doctor is a human being , knows about his humanity , it &apos;s not very proud to be proud of mistakes , but it &apos;s all about learning anything from them , so that it can be passed .
they share their experience with others .
they supported when others talk about their errors .
and it shows other people &apos;s mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a sense , meaningful ways all benefit from it .
and she &apos;s working in a medical culture , which recognizes that people fill the system with life and if that &apos;s like that , then people make errors from time to time .
so the system is creating evolved , which make it easier to make it easier for people to make people , and it allows treatment to create supportive spaces , to create supportive spaces in which everybody who are watching the health services , even things that are <unk> , and it &apos;s actually <unk> for people like that , which is a potential errors , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be done for people like that .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the new political doctor .
i &apos;m a man . i make mistakes .
i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn to be able to learn how to make it different .
i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about me , but i can live .
let me close by three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories to use the time .
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you know , he &apos;d be here in <unk> .
you might think that he <unk> <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
in fact , he did fish .
he described one of them as very &quot; usually . &quot;
it was a <unk> .
up to the &apos; 80s , he was found in great style .
now it &apos;s on the red list of the species .
this story we &apos;ve heard a lot of times from the galapagos or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
and yet , we &apos;re still coming in on the galapagos .
we &apos;re still thinking they &apos;re initially initially .
the <unk> describe them as pristine .
what &apos;s going on here ?
the second story is to be a different concept , the <unk> <unk> .
because i experienced it when i was in 1971 a lagoon in <unk> .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could integrate myself .
and i got a terrible <unk> , and i was convinced that i didn &apos;t really exist from there .
it was my first job .
and as you can see , the lagoon of <unk> and a few mangroves .
there were <unk> of about 20 inches , <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> and the fishermen were living in ghana , and they were good at ghana .
when i got there , 27 years later , the fish fell on half of his height .
and what they did was they put five centimeters .
they were genetically modified .
it was still fish .
the people were still happy .
and the fish was also fortunate to be there .
so nothing changed , and yet it changed everything .
my third little story tells me about my <unk> at the introduction of <unk> in southeast asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather , at the beginning of the 1960s -- <unk> europe .
<unk> <unk> + countries that started hundreds of thousands of fish , the industrial fishing bear is called <unk> <unk> .
i was driving on that , and we did the census of the entire new ocean , and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we started with there .
i now know that it was the bottom of the sea .
ninety percent of our <unk> were sponges , other animals that are connected to the cause .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots there on the rubble , the <unk> , were <unk> .
it was basically the reason that the ocean was on deck , and then it became <unk> .
these pictures are extraordinary , because the transition goes very quickly .
within a year , you go through a <unk> , and then you start with commercial fishing .
the reason it changes . from -- in this case -- a hard reason or soft corals is <unk> crap .
that &apos;s a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they threw them away because they were dead .
we started a long story .
she wasn &apos;t <unk> .
they wanted to kill them , because you could eat them good .
in fact , this mountain of rubble is actually accumulated by the fishermen , if you drive into areas where you &apos;re never going to be stored in that .
it &apos;s not going to be documented .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we adjust our <unk> of the new level , and we didn &apos;t worry about what was there .
when you put it , it happens .
on the y-axis are a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the <unk> .
over time , it changes . it changes , because for the people , their actions , of course , are very natural .
every generation looks at the pictures that you &apos;re looking at at the beginning of your gaze , as a standard and everything that &apos;s going to happen .
the difference will be perceived as a loss .
but they don &apos;t take the previous losses .
there can be a order of changes .
and at the end , they want to get rid of the <unk> remains .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now .
we want to get things that are gone or things that are no longer as they were .
now , you might think that the problem of people who certainly were sure when they were living in <unk> societies , animals , and they were just realized for a few generations of what they had done .
because it &apos;s obviously an animal that &apos;s very common , once rarely , before it <unk> .
so you don &apos;t have a lot of popularity animals .
you &apos;re always losing rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be seen as a big loss .
with time , we focus on the big animals and in the sea , that &apos;s the big fish .
they &apos;re going to rare because we catch them .
over time remains a little fish , and we think that &apos;s the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because you don &apos;t know it was a different place .
of course , a lot of people will say that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to confirm it , because the evidence , as they operate in a earlier shape , are not as they would like to make the evidence .
so , for example , the anecdote , for example , is that the report of a <unk> named <unk> , which is <unk> , not going to be used , or <unk> normally , because it &apos;s not <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientifically . &quot;
so we have the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
that shows the tremendously great role that can play a higgs boson game .
because by marine marine reserves , we &apos;re basically making the past .
we &apos;re making the past back , which people can &apos;t understand , because the <unk> have changed and very low .
you can see the people who see a higgs boson and they benefit from the views that allows us to be <unk> .
what about the people that you can &apos;t do , because you don &apos;t have access to -- the people in the midwest , for example ?
you can see , i think , the art and the film , maybe the gap can fill , and simulation .
this is the simulation of chesapeake bay .
a long time ago , there were <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> , you might remember &quot; avatar . &quot;
when you think of &quot; avatar &quot; thinking , if you think about why people have been touched by this -- except by the <unk> , why were they so struck by the <unk> ?
because it &apos;s a little bit of a <unk> that has been lost in a way .
so , my recommendation , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you , is that it &apos;s called &quot; avatar ii &quot; underwater .
thank you .
in the &apos; 80s , in communist , in communist <unk> , you had to have a typewriter in the <unk> .
they also had to get a leaf with <unk> from this typewriter .
the reason for that : the government could <unk> where a text came from .
and if you had a paper with <unk> <unk> , you could detect the creator of these thoughts .
and we weren &apos;t able to understand how anybody could do something like this , and how much that would be <unk> .
in our own own countries , we would never do something like this .
but if you &apos;re going to buy a new <unk> from the leading <unk> and print one page , then these hand bright yellow yellow <unk> on each page , in a pattern , which is clear to them and their printer .
that &apos;s what happens to us today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and that was an example of how our own governments make the technology against us , the citizens .
and that &apos;s one of the three <unk> of these today are <unk> .
let &apos;s look at what &apos;s going on in the world : we can split the attacks in categories .
we have three <unk> .
there &apos;s <unk> .
for instance , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> in ukraine .
and the motives of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use ambiguity to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are several well-known cases of <unk> , <unk> , which have earned their money through attacks .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in estonia .
this is alfred hitchcock .
there &apos;s 11 watts .
<unk> <unk> .
these are matthew anderson , <unk> <unk> and so on and so forth .
these people have come online up online , but they &apos;ve been done illegal by using <unk> , for example , to claws money from our <unk> , as we do , or <unk> , which we &apos;ve collected on the keyboard , as we go through a infected computer online , as we go through a infected computer online .
the u.s. intelligence agency <unk> , two months ago , the swiss account of mr. sam jain here , and on this <unk> , <unk> million dollars when it was frozen .
and mr. jain himself is on the border foot , which is unknown .
and i &apos;m claiming that today is that we &apos;re more likely to be victims of a <unk> than one fellow in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this will only be worse .
in the future , most of the crimes will play online .
the second <unk> we can observe today are not motivated by money .
they &apos;re motivated by something else -- deconstruct , a opinion , or by the audience .
so , like anonymous , like anonymous , over the last 12 months , has become one of the <unk> in the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : criminals that are doing it for the money , <unk> like anonymous that are filling with it , but the last group are nations , governments that lead the attacks .
it &apos;s us to be aware of what &apos;s going on .
it shows what happens when governments attack their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> of the netherlands -- it was that .
in the last fall , it had to be <unk> , because it was been hacked .
someone was <unk> and had the system of a sudden thorough .
and last week in a meeting week , with dutch <unk> , i asked one of the senior members of this group , whether it &apos;s possible that because of the <unk> people had died .
and his answer was &quot; yes . &quot;
now , how are people dying in a row ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a certificate you need if you have a website with <unk> , with <unk> , for example .
now we &apos;re all using , or many of us , gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are particularly prevalent in <unk> states like iran , because they know that they can trust them as a local <unk> , and they can &apos;t be able to trust the local government , so that the local government can &apos;t <unk> in their conversation . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but if you look into a foreign foreign system .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the case of <unk> .
how does it happen with the arab spring and the things that have happened in egypt ?
now , in egypt , the pours in april <unk> the headquarters of egyptian <unk> , and they found a lot of records .
in these records , a folder called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this folder , there were notes in germany of germany in germany who had sold the egyptian government a few programs where they were -- in very great flux -- all the communication of egyptian citizens could bring citizens . . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
they had sold this program for energy-efficient euros to the egyptian government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western western governments make governments of <unk> governments , so that they can take their own citizens to their own citizens . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
but western governments help themselves .
so , for instance , in germany just a few weeks ago , this was a <unk> , which was used by german <unk> to <unk> their own citizens . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp;
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , you &apos;re going to be <unk> with your phone .
but today we &apos;re far beyond that .
they tap their <unk> .
they use tools like the <unk> to <unk> their computer with a <unk> that allows them to monitoring their entire communication , their <unk> , their <unk> , their <unk> .
so if we keep thinking about these things , the obvious answer of the people , &quot; okay , that sounds bad , but it doesn &apos;t really matter me because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about it !
i don &apos;t have anything to hide . &quot;
and that argument doesn &apos;t make any sense .
privacy needs to be present .
privacy is not about debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and safety .
it &apos;s a choice between freedom and control .
and as we &apos;re today , in 2011 , our governments are trust , but every right thing we &apos;re going to do is we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and trust we trust ourselves , we trust each of our future government , a government that we might be going to be in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to do to the next 50 years .
it may show you odd , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first offshore ones were made <unk> and <unk> of a simple idea : tiny out of concrete with actual gains that fit .
airs were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they put us into building things that were larger than we , buildings , bridges , a stone after the other .
basically , the <unk> has become the building block of our time .
it &apos;s a hundred years later , in 1947 , lego that came out of lego .
it was called &quot; automatically <unk> stone . &quot;
and within a years , moved lego in every household .
it &apos;s been estimated that over 400 billion stones have been produced -- or 75 rocks for each person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful homes , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings .
lego made it for everyone .
what ataturk did was basically the <unk> , the building block of the world , and it &apos;s taken a building block for our imagination .
in the same year , in the same year , the next revolution announced the next revolution , the next building .
the transistor was a little <unk> that was taken us from a world of <unk> building blocks to a world where everything was interactive .
like the <unk> , let &apos;s imagine treating transistor much larger than building more complex circuits , a stone after the other .
but there &apos;s one <unk> : the transistor was only experts for experts .
i personally don &apos;t accept the application of our time for experts , and so i decided to change that .
eight years ago i was at the media lab at the media lab , and i started studying this idea of how you put the power of engineers into the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i started developing <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic injuries that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , sound , engine and sensor .
and the best part is that they connect to magnets .
you can &apos;t put them wrong around you .
the stones are <unk> .
green is copy , blue is power , pink is input and orange .
so all you need to do is build a blue and a green one , and you can build very quickly <unk> .
they add a blue into a green , and they can do light .
you can put a switch in between you and so you have a little <unk> .
take the switch out for a <unk> , which is here , and they have done a little <unk> .
if you add this <unk> for a extra impact , and you &apos;ve created a <unk> .
i &apos;ll stop that .
in fact , if you look beyond the simple game , it &apos;s actually quite powerful .
so instead of you , you have to program <unk> or <unk> , allowing them to code with simple , intuitive gestures .
so to slow down the <unk> , or slow down , they just turn on that button and it does the momentum faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring each person in the world into a <unk> rock .
solar , sound , <unk> , motors -- it should be available .
we &apos;ve got access to kids and see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most beautiful is , how do you start the electronics that you see in the everyday life , and you don &apos;t learn to be in school .
for example , for example , if the <unk> works , or why the doors &apos;s doors , or how a ipod responds to touch .
we &apos;ve also brought together to be <unk> .
so , we had , for example , designers with no experience in electronic things that began to play with <unk> as a material .
here we see here , with <unk> , paper and water , like <unk> ...
so a few weeks ago , we had access to risd and give them a few designers that had no technical experience -- just breeze , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; do what . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they did , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a hummer made of play-dough , the fear of the darkness .
for this <unk> , it became a other material , electronics was just another material .
and we want to make this material for all available .
so <unk> open source .
you can go to the website , all <unk> download and make it yourself .
we want the world of creators , the inventor , the <unk> , because this world that we live in , these interactive world , we have heard of us .
so , pull off and start to invent them .
thank you .
