you know , one of the big <unk> to travel , and one of the <unk> research in the <unk> research is to live together with the people who can remember the old days , and they &apos;re still in the wind , they &apos;re always able to touch them on the <unk> rocks of plants .
you know , you know that <unk> is still beyond the milky way , or the meaning of the <unk> of the oldest <unk> , or that in the himalayas , the <unk> of <unk> , means that in the himalayas , it &apos;s still <unk> , but only as a model of reality , as a result of a group of particular possibilities , the <unk> of our experience , even successful , a lot of generations , a lot of generations .
and of course , we share all the same <unk> .
we &apos;re all born . we bring kids to the world .
we &apos;re using <unk> .
we need to get out of death through death of death , and so we should not surprise ourselves that we all said , dance and and the art .
but interesting is the unique <unk> of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
now , it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s about the <unk> in the desert , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or the <unk> in haiti , or a <unk> in the middle of the sahara , this is about the colleague that i grew up with a month in the desert , everest , the <unk> of the world , everest , the <unk> of the world .
all of these people teach us that there are other kinds of <unk> , other things , other ways to <unk> on earth .
and this is an idea that if you think about it , you can only be able to deal with hope .
together , the other cultures in the world is a network of <unk> and <unk> life that the earth &apos;s <unk> , and that &apos;s the way that the earth is just important , like the biological <unk> that you know as biosphere .
you can think of this cultural <unk> than an <unk> , <unk> <unk> , as the <unk> of all of the thoughts and dreams , <unk> ideas , <unk> and information that have been used by human imagination since the beginning of consciousness .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it &apos;s the symbol of all of what we are and what we &apos;re doing as amazing <unk> species .
and the same way that the biosphere was a lot <unk> , this is what happened with the <unk> -- only more expensive speed .
so , i would say , for example , to say that 50 percent or more than a lot of all sorts of time is , it &apos;s just not true . and yet , this -- this -- the <unk> <unk> on the area of biological diversity -- is hardly that what we &apos;re known as <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity .
and the key part of this is that it &apos;s about languages of languages .
once every one of them was born in this room , the earth was talking about 6,000 languages .
now , the language is not only the <unk> of the <unk> or a series of <unk> .
one language is expression of human mind .
it &apos;s a means that the soul of a certain culture has access to the physical world .
every language is like a <unk> institute of mind , an <unk> , a thought , a fact , an ecosystem of the potential possibilities .
and from these 6,000 languages today , while we &apos;re sitting here in monterey , that half of half no more in the ears of children .
they &apos;re not going to be taught anymore . that means if nothing is going to be done , they &apos;re actually dead .
what could be lonely as the ross <unk> , one of the last of the people who talk to your language , not to have a chance to have the wisdom of the ancestors of the ancestors , or the hope to expect children ?
and yet , this horrible fate was actually about someone in the earth , about all two weeks ago , because all two weeks ago , after all two weeks , after all two weeks , a older language is going to be in the grave .
and i know that some of you would say , &quot; isn &apos;t it better ? &quot;
let &apos;s be <unk> . &quot;
and then they would suddenly recognize how it would be if you couldn &apos;t talk your own language .
so , i want to take you to a trip to a trip through the <unk> , a short journey through the <unk> , to try to try to make them understand what &apos;s actually going to be lost .
now , there are some of us who forgot that i think , if i say , &quot; different possibilities of his own , &quot; really different possibilities of his mind .
so , for example , this kid &apos;s <unk> in the center of the amazon , the people of the <unk> , the people of the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from the east , in the belly of holy snakes .
this is a people who don &apos;t have safer between the colors of blue and green , because the <unk> of the woods of the woods that people depend on .
they have a <unk> language , and a <unk> <unk> is called <unk> : you have to marry somebody who &apos;s going to talk a different language .
all of this <unk> in the <unk> past year , and the <unk> of these big houses in which we &apos;re going to be talking about the <unk> six or seven languages , but that &apos;s probably that you never hear somebody who learn a language .
you just hear and start to talk about it .
or , one of the most amazing tribes that i &apos;ve ever met , the <unk> of <unk> , a amazing people , the first year , the first one was <unk> .
in the year , i tried to put five <unk> <unk> , and made a <unk> mistake .
they took <unk> photographs from the air , which we &apos;d like , as a nice gesture , i forgot that these people from the rainforest was never seen a little bit more <unk> in their life in their life .
they took these photographs from the forest , trying to see the face or the character , they didn &apos;t have to see the face of the devil , and they were killing the <unk> of the devil and killed the five <unk> with the <unk> .
but they don &apos;t kill the <unk> , not only , with the <unk> .
they <unk> each other .
95 percent of the deaths happened by <unk> .
we took the <unk> eight generations back , and we found two cases of natural death , and when we have the people with the <unk> , they gave them that one of the people was so old that he died because of his time , and we had killed him with the <unk> .
but at the same time , they had a clear <unk> of the woods that was amazing .
and they were able to <unk> the <unk> of a invention from 40 steps , and they define what the organism of this was .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job when i was interested in my professor in harvard , if i was interested in my professor in harvard , and <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> that was used to do is to make <unk> <unk> .
so , to give a sense of this <unk> , i had to give you something about this remarkable belief of <unk> knowledge , and <unk> is not an <unk> of black magic magic .
in the opposite , it &apos;s about a complex <unk> .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i would ask them to ask the big world , what would you say ?
museums , islam , <unk> , <unk> , or whatever .
so a continent is always <unk> , because the <unk> was that it &apos;s not a religious belief , of course , and of course , there was one , and <unk> is just the <unk> of this very awful religious thought that was in the tragic <unk> of <unk> .
but what <unk> is so interesting is this <unk> relationship between the living and the dead .
the living relationship is the instructions .
the instructions can be <unk> from under the big water , answers on the rhythm of the dance to <unk> the spirit of living in the world , so that the <unk> for a short <unk> moment for god is to god .
<unk> tells the <unk> , &quot; your white is in the church , and you &apos;re talking about god .
we dance in the temple and will god . &quot;
and because you &apos;re obsessed with it , you &apos;re going to go from the mind . how can you eat damage ?
now , you see this amazing <unk> : <unk> in a <unk> , the <unk> coal , without <unk> <unk> , an amazing explanation of the ability to change the body , that this is <unk> , if it &apos;s in a state of extremes .
now , of all people i met , the <unk> from the sierra valley of santa <unk> <unk> <unk> , the most popular .
<unk> <unk> civilization , which is the <unk> <unk> of colombia , and in the context of <unk> , this people went to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is about the <unk> <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , these people were the only ones that never had been done by the <unk> .
and after today , they &apos;re going to be <unk> by a <unk> <unk> . the education is very extraordinary , but it &apos;s very extraordinary .
well , the boys are <unk> in the age of three and four years of their families from their families , and in a <unk> world of <unk> <unk> <unk> , and two years from nine years ago , <unk> <unk> , who they spend in the lap of their <unk> mom , they spend now <unk> in the car of the big mother .
and while this whole time , they &apos;re going to be used in the values of their society , values that <unk> the argument that their <unk> and only their prayers , the indus world -- or we could say the ecological -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing <unk> , they &apos;re looking at one day , and at the first time in your life , in the age of 18 years , you &apos;re going to see a <unk> . and in this <unk> moment of consciousness , you &apos;re going to see a <unk> . and in this <unk> moment , it goes back and says , &quot; look , you know ? it &apos;s really what i told you .
it &apos;s so wonderful . you need to protect it . &quot;
they call the older brothers , and they say that we are the younger brothers , for the destruction of the world .
now this level of intuition will be very important .
even when we think about <unk> and landscape , we &apos;re not going to <unk> , and the old <unk> of the ridiculous wild , which is in his <unk> , is a <unk> thought , or the <unk> and say , these people are more connected to nature than we are .
so , <unk> are not <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> by the <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t use a lot of place in the <unk> <unk> of <unk> or the cold corners of tibet , but they still have been able to be close by time and ritual in a far <unk> intuition , which is not going to be close to the idea that the earth can only exist because it &apos;s going to be <unk> in human consciousness .
well , what does that mean ?
it means that a little kid from the <unk> , which is in the belief that the mountain is a <unk> , which is that the mountain , or your fate , is going to be a <unk> , or a different relationship with this resource , or a different relationship with this resource , is that a mountain of rocks can be <unk> .
if it &apos;s a <unk> of a mind or a bunch of <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> .
the interesting thing is the metaphor of which the relationship between the individual and nature of nature .
i grew up in the woods of <unk> censorship , and he believed that these forests are going to be <unk> .
and this led me to one other people as my friends under the <unk> , who believe that these forests of the <unk> of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> goods , and the <unk> of the world are living in the world of the world .
now , if you start to look at the idea that these cultures can create different realities , you can understand some of their extraordinary discoveries , like this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph that i had only taken last april in the northwest coast of the amazon .
this is <unk> , from the many of you heard , the most powerful <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> .
what <unk> is so fascinating , not only the <unk> potential of this <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s going to be made by two different sources of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . it &apos;s going to be <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be <unk> by the <unk> of the family <unk> with the names of the names of <unk> <unk> .
this plant contains some very strong <unk> that the <unk> of water , <unk> and <unk> are very similar .
if you &apos;ve seen the <unk> <unk> , like they <unk> this stuff , this substance that they have from different kinds of forms is also <unk> .
so this is about being able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of a <unk> , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the <unk> on a ocean of electricity .
it &apos;s not going to produce the <unk> of reality , but the resolution of reality .
i even have my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man who <unk> the <unk> <unk> with the discovery of the magic mushrooms in mexico in the <unk> years , and i told you that you couldn &apos;t make this <unk> as a <unk> , in the moment that you feel the implications , you don &apos;t have more there to experience a <unk> .
but the thing that i mean , is that they can &apos;t be <unk> , because they can &apos;t be <unk> , because it &apos;s in the human mind , of course , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
they can only be <unk> with some other chemicals that are <unk> <unk> .
now , the fascinating thing is that the <unk> that are in the <unk> , <unk> from exactly the way that is necessary to <unk> the <unk> . so , you ask yourself yourself .
how can these people come from a <unk> of 80,000 species , <unk> plants that are not able to find <unk> plants , which is , if we create this way , a kind of <unk> version , so that the whole bigger than the sum of his parts is ?
we use this great <unk> , trying and errors , which is what it turns out .
but if you ask the american , you say , &quot; the plant talks to us . &quot;
so what does that mean ?
this tribe , the <unk> , of 17 areas of <unk> , which you &apos;re all in the woods that you &apos;re all in the woods in the woods that you can see for our eyes as a kind of <unk> .
and then you ask them how they put their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i thought you understand something of plants .
i mean , you don &apos;t know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
so , it turns out that you &apos;re looking at every one of 17 areas in <unk> , and they sing them in a different <unk> .
now , it doesn &apos;t take a <unk> in harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than <unk> .
now , the <unk> of the problem is that even those of us who are <unk> , the sympathy for the hard way of the population , it &apos;s as <unk> and <unk> , but it &apos;s kind of kind of <unk> in the past , while the real world , that &apos;s our world .
so , the fact is that you know about the 20th century , in 300 years , not for his body or technical innovation , but even as a era of a era where we were growing , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity on earth is not the change .
all cultures have been involved in the dance with new <unk> .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> heard is not going to be less in the sioux , when they <unk> and arrow , as the americans told americans to be americans when they were a horse and <unk> tasks .
not change and technology , the integrity of the <unk> . it &apos;s power . the ugly face of <unk> .
now , in the world , in the world , in the world , you &apos;re going to discover that these cultures are not going to be <unk> , and these are dynamic areas that are <unk> in the woods , and these are dynamic areas in the middle of the <unk> , which is going to be <unk> in the woods , which is going to be <unk> in the sea , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> in the 1960s , where you can see the airport , or like in the case of <unk> ,
or if we go to the mountains of tibet , where i &apos;m interested in the mountains of tibet , you will see the ugly face of political television .
you know , the genocide , the <unk> of people are going to be <unk> by people , but the <unk> , the destruction of the life of people , is not just <unk> , but in general and <unk> as part of a <unk> .
and you can &apos;t understand the suffering , if you haven &apos;t experienced it on <unk> level .
i met with a young colleagues of 6,000 miles from <unk> <unk> by <unk> , and only when i looked at <unk> , i saw the face behind the statistics of whom you hear . 6,000 anderson <unk> , which was made in <unk> , 1.2 million people who were killed during the <unk> of the <unk> .
so the father of this boy was <unk> as the <unk> of the <unk> lama .
and that meant that he was killed during the chinese invasion .
his uncle , with their <unk> , in the players who brought people in the players who brought people back to nepal .
his mother was <unk> , as a <unk> for -- to be the crime .
he was in the age of two years in jail for two years to hide under their <unk> <unk> , because they couldn &apos;t live it .
the sister that made this brave did was <unk> in a <unk> .
one day , she came out to a <unk> <unk> , and for those <unk> , they had to have to <unk> it for seven years in a very difficult <unk> .
the suffering can be <unk> , but the <unk> mind of human beings is something <unk> .
and at the end of the end , we really want to have a choice , do we want to be in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity ?
<unk> <unk> , the big prize said before she died that it was their biggest fear that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to see the whole range of human imagination on a <unk> way , but that we would read one day from a dream of a dream , and we forgot that there was ever possible ways .
and it &apos;s extraordinary to think that our species might exist for 200,000 years .
and the <unk> revolution that made us agriculture , and in this moment , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry of <unk> <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and leadership created -- only 10,000 years ago .
modern industrial world as we know it is hardly 300 years old .
now , this <unk> story doesn &apos;t tell me that we &apos;re all answers to the challenges that we &apos;re in the next millennia .
if we ask these more <unk> to the importance of human beings , answers with 10,000 different voices .
and in this song , we &apos;re going to make the possibility of what we are : people with all of the things that are aware of the importance of the importance that all people and enemies have to be <unk> , and there are great moments of optimism .
here &apos;s a photograph that i was in the northern end of the <unk> , when i went to <unk> , and this man , <unk> , and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his grandfather .
the south government doesn &apos;t always be very good with the volcano , and during the <unk> years , in the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of our <unk> , they were forced to be forced to <unk> .
the head of this old man killed .
the family who was scared about his life , he took them all the weapons and all the tools .
now you &apos;ve got to know that the volcano doesn &apos;t have fear of cold . they used them to have advantage of their advantage .
the <unk> of their <unk> were taken out of fish that was <unk> in <unk> .
the head of the man &apos;s head didn &apos;t have been from the arctic night , or the <unk> iphone .
he <unk> out , <unk> his foot out of <unk> and <unk> in his hand , and as the <unk> , and as the <unk> , he made it in the form of a <unk> .
it was <unk> <unk> on the sides of the <unk> , and when it was completely frozen , he <unk> a dog .
he <unk> the dog and <unk> a gram , the skeleton of the dog , and <unk> a <unk> , <unk> a different dog , and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> .
so you can &apos;t do something like that .
and this is in many ways to be a symbol for the resistance of the volcano and all the population in the world .
the <unk> government had the volcano in april , in 1999 , the full control of a area , which is bigger than california and texas .
it &apos;s our new house , and it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> area . they control all the <unk> .
and an amazing example , like a nation , a state that can look at <unk> with their beings and achieve .
and finally , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious , at least , at least for the people who are going to come to these distant goals of earth , to see that they &apos;re not removed .
they &apos;re the <unk> of somebody .
they represent parts of the human imagination that <unk> in the past times , and for all of us , the dreams of these children , how the dreams of our own children are part of hope .
what we &apos;re trying to end up with national geographic , is that we believe politicians never do something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> is not serious , but we believe that architecture can change the world , and so we &apos;re probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website has 35 million <unk> every month every month .
thousands of nations send out our <unk> .
our frustration are going to read from millions of millions .
and we have a series of travel in the <unk> , where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places from such a cultural question that you can take out of such cultural questions , that the world is <unk> , and hopefully , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to find a <unk> in a really <unk> world , where the wisdom of all humans can do to our common well-being .
thank you .
now , what i think is that fast as possible as possible , is the fundamental work , a new technology , a new technology that we have microsoft as part of a world , and it &apos;s an environment , and it &apos;s a environment where they &apos;re either a <unk> or removed with huge amounts of visual data .
we see many , many <unk> of digital photos here that you can see <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , in any way .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how many information we &apos;re looking at how big these foundations are or how big the images are .
most of you are digital photos of a camera , but this is the example of this , for example , a scan of the <unk> , and it &apos;s in a area of 300 <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that the performance of a system is like this , is the number of <unk> on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible architecture .
this is a whole book , a example of <unk> .
this is <unk> house from <unk> . every <unk> is a chapter .
to prove that it &apos;s really about a text and not about a picture , we can do something like that , to really show that this is a real representation of the <unk> and not image .
maybe this is an artificial way to read a <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t read it .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
and this is really what you really have the pleasure and the good experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is a kind of medium with multiple sources .
we also have something on the corner of this special copy of the guardian .
we &apos;ve designed a wrong fan with very high <unk> , which is much higher than a normal protocell , and we &apos;ve created additional content .
if you want to see the functions of this car , you can see them here .
or other models , or even a <unk> <unk> .
and this is really what these ideas are going to be able to create these conditions for the <unk> place on the screen .
we hope that this is not going to be <unk> and other <unk> , that should not be necessary .
of course , this is one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i really don &apos;t want to spend a lot of time , except to say that we &apos;re going to be doing this area .
but these are all the streets in the united states .
<unk> on the <unk> image of nasa .
so let &apos;s take something else else .
this is still live in the internet . they can <unk> it .
this is a project with the names of <unk> , which is really two different technologies together .
the one is <unk> , and the other is a very good research about <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> <unk> , a <unk> of university in washington , under the <unk> of steve <unk> on the <unk> .
and rick <unk> was done by microsoft research . a very good collaboration .
so this is live in the internet . it &apos;s going to be driven by <unk> .
and you can see that if we create this kind of perspectives that we can get through images , and these experience of <unk> <unk> .
but the destruction of the images is here in the fact of meaning .
the <unk> have made these images together with the real room , where these photographs that have been done all of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and you can see the elements of <unk> slides or <unk> <unk> , and these things were all made in the relationship in the relationship with each other .
i don &apos;t know if i have time to show you different environments .
there are the ones that are much <unk> .
and i &apos;d like to show god of the <unk> data of <unk> , and this is from a early prototype of <unk> , which we first &apos;ve been working on in summer , to show you what i believe is that it &apos;s really the <unk> behind this technology , which is <unk> , and that &apos;s not necessarily obvious if you look at the environments that we have on the website .
we had to make ourselves from the lawyers and worry about the lawyers .
this is an <unk> of the cathedral of the cathedral , which is only in the computer with pictures of flickr , and they &apos;re going to be able to take pictures of men in <unk> , and they &apos;re going to get pictures of men in rwanda , and you &apos;re going to get the pictures of men , and that &apos;s what was discovered as to this model .
so this is all <unk> , and they all are in the world in the relationship with each other .
and we can move on this very simple way .
and you know , i never believed that i &apos;m going to work on microsoft .
i &apos;m very grateful for the <unk> here .
and i think you can see that these are many different kinds of cameras : all of this , from the <unk> to the professional <unk> , a pretty big number of <unk> , a pretty big number of them all in this environment .
and if possible , i &apos;m going to find some of the strange things .
many of them are separated by faces .
there &apos;s a series of photographs -- here they are .
this is actually a poster , and this is actually a poster photograph , which was right .
we can change from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
the point is that we can do things with the social environment , and we &apos;re going to get data from all of all -- from the entire collective memory of how , like , visual the earth looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photographs are connected to each other , and it creates something that is bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that comes from the entire earth .
look at this as the <unk> of the work of stephen <unk> on virtual earth .
and this is something that &apos;s about the complexity that people use it , and they &apos;re using it to use the use for the user to get bigger .
their own photographs are going to be <unk> with <unk> , which has taken another person .
and if somebody has done it , and you &apos;re going to take all this <unk> and tell you who you &apos;re all going to do , and i &apos;m going to use them to start with my photograph , and i can use them as the beginning to put in this room , in these <unk> , the photos of other people , and so a kind of <unk> <unk> of social experience with the use of others .
and of course , <unk> of all of these are the massive rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth that doesn &apos;t only be through <unk> or <unk> and so forth , but by collective memory .
thank you .
i understand it right ? you know , the software allows you to be in the next years , within the next years , all the images that are going to be used by somebody in the world are used to be connected to each other ?
yeah . it doesn &apos;t make any other other than discover .
if you want to get them out of the images between the images .
and they &apos;re doing this because of the content in the images .
and that &apos;s really exciting , if you think about the <unk> of the <unk> information that many of these images have .
as if you make a <unk> for images , where you &apos;re looking at sentences , and the text of the website there is a lot of information about what is the image that is .
but how would it be if the image you &apos;re doing with all of their images ?
then , the <unk> of the <unk> and the amount that makes it creates , really enormous . it &apos;s a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that &apos;s really incredible . thank you .
thank you very much .
i &apos;m going to tell you some things from my book , like i hope that we &apos;ve heard of other things that you &apos;ve already heard about , and i &apos;m going to try to create a couple of connections if you don &apos;t notice that .
i want to start with what i call &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
the gift <unk> of what ?
the official <unk> of all western western societies .
so the gift of <unk> works like this : if our goal is the <unk> of the potential of our citizens , that &apos;s all about the <unk> of the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom in itself is good , valuable , meaning , a <unk> goal for human beings .
when people have freedom , every one of us is to do the things that our local <unk> and no one has to decide to decide .
the way freedom to protect freedom is to protect choice .
the more choices people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more <unk> you have .
this is , i think it &apos;s so deep in our water , that there would be no one in the sense that it would be like that .
and it &apos;s also <unk> in our lives .
i &apos;m going to give you some examples of what modern progress allows us to be .
this is my supermarket . no big .
i just want to say a little bit about <unk> .
there are <unk> <unk> in my supermarket , if you couldn &apos;t make the 10 different <unk> , <unk> and 12 <unk> that they could buy a big number of <unk> , in the fundamental case that no one of the <unk> in the store is right for them .
so this is how the supermarket is .
and then they &apos;re going to go to the <unk> business of a <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> , <unk> , and in this kind of electronics business , there are so many <unk> facilities .
we can have <unk> millions of different <unk> of the components of the components that are going to be killed in this one of a business .
you have to say that this is a big choice .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time when i was a boy , there could be a boy , there could be a boy , and he wanted to get to her , as long as he came from sir bell .
they &apos;re <unk> her phone . they didn &apos;t buy it . <unk> <unk> .
one of them was that the telephone was never broken .
these days are over .
now , we &apos;re almost a infinite choice of phones , especially in the world of neurons .
these are the <unk> of the future .
my favorite thing is in the middle of the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and i don &apos;t want to see that till you &apos;ve seen in your business , you can be sure they &apos;re going to be happy .
and what it does is to get people to go into the business and ask this question .
you know what the answer to this question is ?
the answer is , &quot; no . &quot;
it &apos;s not possible to buy a mobile phone , not too much .
in other parts of life that are very much <unk> than the buy of objects , the same explosion is the same explosion of choice .
history -- it &apos;s not more than the case in the united states that they &apos;re going to go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , they go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you : we could make a plan or we could do b .
one has this benefits and risks .
b has this benefits and risks . what do you want ?
and they say , &quot; doctor , what do i do ? &quot;
the doctor says one has this benefits and risks and b and b has the benefits and risks .
what do you want ?
and if you say , &quot; if you were , let me say , doctor , what would you do ? &quot;
the doctor says , &quot; but i &apos;m not . &quot;
the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonomy . &quot; that sounds like a good thing , but in reality , is a shift in the <unk> of responsibility for someone who knows something -- <unk> the doctor -- to someone that doesn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s why not in the best constitution is a decision to meet -- <unk> the patient .
there &apos;s enormous marketing for <unk> drugs for people like them and me , which , if you think about it , it doesn &apos;t make sense , because we don &apos;t buy it .
why don &apos;t you do that if we can &apos;t buy ?
the answer is : you expect to expect the doctor &apos;s doctor &apos;s next morning and to ask a change of the choice .
this is how our identity is like our identity is now a question of the choice , like this slide .
we don &apos;t feed identity , we invent them .
and we &apos;re trying to do as often as we want to do .
that means that every day , if you wake up at the morning , you have to decide to decide what a kind of person you want to be .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in which the <unk> was that almost every one had had one , and they were able to <unk> them so fast as they could , and then so fast children got out of them as they could .
the only real choice was , &quot; who , not when , and not what they did .
today , everything is easy to have .
i teach me wonderful intelligent students , and i &apos;m going to give you 20 percent less work than i did .
and that &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and not because they &apos;re less carefully .
it &apos;s because they &apos;re working with other things , they ask yourself , &quot; should i marry marry or not ? am i going to marry ?
should i marry later ? should i have kids , or only career ?
these are all <unk> questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , regardless of whether that means all the tasks that i &apos;m going to do is <unk> , and i don &apos;t have a good note in my age .
and in fact , they should do this . these are important to <unk> questions .
now -- we &apos;re blessed , like carl , with the technology that allows us to work every minute of every day from every day to work on the planet -- until the <unk> hotel .
so there &apos;s a corner of the corner that i &apos;m not going to tell you about the <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to tell you because i want to use it .
so what it means is this incredible freedom of choice that we have to make decisions , again , and again , and again , whether we should work or not work .
we can look at our children with <unk> , and we &apos;ve got our mobile phone on which a hip , and our <unk> on other treatment , and our laptop would probably be on our car .
and also , if you &apos;re all <unk> , every minute in which we &apos;re going to do with our child , we &apos;re going to ask us , &quot; should i say this call ?
should i answer this email ? should i write this letter ?
and also , if the answer to the question is , &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s just going to be the experience of the <unk> of their child &apos;s <unk> in their child .
everywhere we look at , big things and little things , material things , material things , life is a question of choice .
and the world in which we &apos;ve been looked like this .
so i want to say there were some choices , but not anything was a question of choice .
and the world in which we &apos;re going to see life looks like this .
and the question is , are the good news or bad news ?
the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about this , so i &apos;m going to think about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of these choices have two effects , two negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> way , is that it &apos;s more than <unk> .
with so many options that you can choose , it &apos;s very hard to decide to decide .
i &apos;m going to give you another <unk> example of this , a study about investing in volunteers in volunteers .
a colleague of mine had access to <unk> from <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of about a million employees and about 2,000 different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> <unk> that was <unk> , and it took a half percent .
they give 50 <unk> -- 10 percent less employees as if they were just five , and why ?
because it &apos;s 50 <unk> , which is so hard to decide that it &apos;s so hard to decide what you &apos;re going to choose .
and then tomorrow , and then morning , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , i never had .
you know that this is not just called the people &apos;s emotional food , if you &apos;re going to go to the interviews , because they don &apos;t have enough money to be able to get it out , it means that the decisions are so hard that they &apos;re going to give you a <unk> .
it &apos;s not <unk> , they give up to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year from the <unk> , who would have happy would have been <unk> .
association is a result of a lot of choices .
and i think it turns out that the world looks like this .
they want to make the decision really right , if it &apos;s for all of it , right ?
they don &apos;t want to choose the wrong investment , or even the wrong <unk> .
so this is one effect . the other effect is that even if we put the <unk> and make a decision , we &apos;re going to end up less happy with the outcome of choice , as if we had to have the opportunity to decide between less possibilities .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is designed by the big choice of different <unk> , if you buy a buy , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what happens is that you could have a different decision to have better . and what happens is that you could have a different decision for happiness , even if it was a good decision .
the more possibilities there are , the easier is it doesn &apos;t seem to worry about anything that they meet .
secondly , what economists call <unk> .
dan gilbert has done a big story today by what he told about how much the kind of things that we call things about it is based on what we &apos;re looking at .
well , if there &apos;s very many alternatives , it &apos;s easy to think of <unk> properties of alternatives that <unk> them , that makes them less happy with the alternatives that they &apos;ve met .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who are not new york , i apologize .
but here &apos;s what they should be .
here &apos;s a few on the <unk> .
very expensive change .
great beach . great day . they &apos;ve got it all the time .
what could be better ? &quot; <unk> &quot; the man thinks , &quot; it &apos;s august .
every one in my <unk> neighborhood is gone .
i could swim directly in my house . &quot;
and he spends two weeks ago from the thought that he had the possibility to have a little bit about a day to have a great bucket .
<unk> <unk> the happiness that we get through our choice , even if that we &apos;ve chosen to be fantastic .
and the more possibilities that we have to make , the more attractive characteristics of this choice is going to be <unk> in the <unk> .
here &apos;s another example .
well , this cartoon makes some of the message .
it makes a statement about this in now life , and maybe things are slow forward to do things .
but a very important point that he &apos;s doing is , all of whom they decide to do for one thing , they don &apos;t decide to do other things .
and these other things like many bad properties , and it becomes what they &apos;re going to do , and it becomes what they &apos;re going to do .
third : <unk> of expectations .
this has met me when i wanted to meet my jeans .
i &apos;m in jeans , almost the whole time .
and there was a time in which there was only jeans , and they &apos;ve bought them , and they &apos;ve bought them , and they were <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> , and if they had a long enough , and they were often sufficient , and they were going , &quot; ok . &quot;
so , i went to buy new jeans for many years , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans here , and i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to have a couple of jeans here , here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the <unk> said , &quot; do you want <unk> , is just <unk> , or <unk> ?
do you want the <unk> or <unk> ? rock ?
do you love with holes ?
if you go down to the bottom , <unk> , blah , blah blah , &quot; and so on , he told me , &quot; and so forth he told .
my chest was the bottom , and after me , i said , &quot; i &apos;d like to say , &quot; i &apos;d like to have the way that the only kind of was . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent a hour after all these <unk> jeans , and <unk> the business -- and i say the truth -- and i say the truth -- with the best <unk> .
i had better . all these choice , it could be better for me to have better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to explain it myself .
and the reason for that , i felt bad , with all these <unk> possibilities , my expectations for what a good couple of jeans , went up .
i had very low expectations . i didn &apos;t have a specific expectations when it was only in a kind of kind of one .
when they came out in 100 ways , <unk> , one of them would have been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and this is how i had to get out of what i was expected to do , and what i had was surprised to think about what i was expected to do .
it &apos;s the only way that the people in the life of human beings are not <unk> the expectations of people like that , as good as these possibilities are going to be .
and this leads to less happiness with the results , even if the results are good .
no one in the world of <unk> knows this . because , if you would , you don &apos;t know what it is .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that it was better than everything was worse than everything was worse than everything was possible for people to make experiences that was a simple surprise .
now , in the world we live in the world we live -- we <unk> , <unk> citizens , with venezuela -- the best thing you can ever hope is that the things are so good about them .
they &apos;re never going to be <unk> because their expectations , my expectations , <unk> .
the secret to <unk> -- that &apos;s what they all come from -- the secret to <unk> is low expectations .
and i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i &apos;m married with a woman , and she &apos;s really really wonderful .
i didn &apos;t have to do better . i don &apos;t have <unk> .
but <unk> is not always as a bad thing .
so , finally , a result of the <unk> of a bad , jeans if there are only a way to buy jeans , and you ask questions why who &apos;s responsible , the answer is responsible . what would you do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy one of them , and they wonder why , who &apos;s responsible ?
is it also clear that the answer is : you know .
they could have better .
there are 100 different kinds of jeans in the <unk> , there &apos;s no excuse for mistakes .
and so , when people meet decisions , and even if the results of decisions are good , you feel disappointed about it , you &apos;re <unk> yourself .
depression depression in the industrial world in the past generation .
i believe a <unk> -- not the only one , but an <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also poverty is that people are <unk> because their standards are so high , and then , if you have to explain that experience itself , you think it would be their taste .
and so this is the <unk> that it &apos;s going to be better in china , namely , and we feel worse .
so let me remind you .
this is the official <unk> , which is one that we all think about right now , completely wrong . it &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s no question that &apos;s better than not , but it doesn &apos;t say that the more choice is better than something .
there &apos;s a magical lot . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty sure that we &apos;ve been surprised with this point of a long time that we &apos;ve been able to be able to improve our existence .
now , as a <unk> question -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a <unk> question , the thing about thinking about is what all of these choice allows to be in the <unk> societies , is the material wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we &apos;ve heard about many of you who are the problem to be the big choice .
the problem is that they have a little bit .
so the things i &apos;m talking about is a remarkable problem of modern , rich , western societies .
and what &apos;s so frustrating and <unk> is : steve <unk> has told them about how this more expensive and hard car is not going to help them . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i tell you is that these expensive , complicated decisions -- it &apos;s not easy to help them .
they don &apos;t even do .
they &apos;re concerned about that we &apos;re bad there .
if something of what the people of our society allows us to meet decisions to meet the societies in which people would have been able to have a little choice , not only the life of human beings , but we &apos;re going to be improved .
now , we call this a <unk> <unk> .
<unk> will worry that it &apos;s going to be better -- not only the poor -- because all these big choice are <unk> .
at the end , you read this cartoon , and i &apos;ll tell you this cartoon , and i said , &quot; ah ! what do this fish know ?
you don &apos;t know it in this <unk> . &quot;
<unk> minds , an <unk> view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it first .
but the more i thought about that , the more i came to the point that the fish are doing something .
because the truth is that if you put the <unk> , that everything is possible , they don &apos;t have freedom . they &apos;ve got it .
if you <unk> the <unk> , this is how it &apos;s possible , you get the happiness .
they increase the <unk> and <unk> happiness .
everybody needs a <unk> .
this is almost very limited to limited security -- maybe for the fish , definitely for us .
but this is the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> is a recipe for misery , and i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects before the human genome , and what that might mean , and the discovery of new groups of genes .
in fact , we &apos;re looking at a new point : we &apos;ve got the biology , and now we &apos;re trying to try to get out of digital code in a new phase of biology by creating new lives and build new lives .
we &apos;re always trying to ask important questions .
what is life ? it &apos;s something that i think many biologists tried to understand and understand that on different levels .
we &apos;ve tried different kinds of different ways to allow it to <unk> components .
we &apos;ve got almost 20 years ago , when we <unk> the <unk> , the change of the <unk> in the digital world of biology in the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask if we can be alive , or whether we can create new life , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , <unk> <unk> , which is the smallest genome of a species that can make itself in the lab , and we tried to understand if we can achieve that with a smaller genome .
we &apos;ve done it on about a hundred genes to make the 500 or something that are here .
but if we look at these <unk> map that &apos;s very simple , in the way of our mind , it &apos;s simple , but if we all look at these genes that we can see one after the other , it would be very unlikely that it would be very unlikely that it would be very unlikely to a living cell .
so we decided that it &apos;s the only way to see that chromosome is actually going to be able to create the individual components , and so some of these fundamental questions .
and so we started with the question , can we make a chromosome ?
to make the chemistry of this really big molecules , which hasn &apos;t been done before ?
and , if we can do that , we can start the chromosome ?
the chromosome is just a piece of <unk> chemical material .
our steps on the <unk> of life was exponentially .
our ability to write genetic code has become very slow , but we &apos;re still <unk> , and our last point would be on a exponential curve .
we began 15 years ago .
it was actually taken a few years ago with a <unk> <unk> before we made the first experiments .
as it turns out , <unk> is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can create little bits of dna , 30 to 50 letters , but it &apos;s a <unk> process , so the longer you &apos;re going to do a piece of power , the more mistakes happen .
so we had to develop a new method with which we were able to put these little bits and <unk> the mistakes .
this was our first attempt , beginning with the digital information , the genome <unk> x <unk> .
it &apos;s a small virus of bacteria .
we built little bits , a <unk> , and we had a dna molecule from about 5,000 letters of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came out when we took this piece of <unk> , and in a bacterium , and the bacteria started to read the genetic code , and i made the genetic particles .
and then the little particles were taken out of the cells and came back , and they came back and killed <unk> <unk> .
recently , i &apos;ve been talking to the oil , and they said they told this model exactly .
they laughed more than you &apos;re doing it here .
so we think that this is a situation in the software that can actually build their own hardware in a biological system .
but we wanted to take a lot further . we wanted to build a whole <unk> chromosome . it &apos;s more than <unk> letters of genetic code , so we thought we &apos;re building it in <unk> from the size of the virus that we could find the size of the <unk> to understand what the individual components of a living cell is .
design is the key , and if you want to start with digital information in the computer , this digital information is really <unk> .
when we first published the genome first , the <unk> was <unk> in a mistake per $ 10,000 <unk> .
and we found in <unk> 30 errors . if we used to be the original sequence , it would never be possible .
one part of the design is to create things that have 50 letters long , and we have to <unk> with other <unk> parts to build smaller <unk> to build smaller <unk> so that .
we have unique elements here .
you might have heard that we &apos;ve been able to have <unk> .
think about this : we &apos;ve got a <unk> code : a , c , g and <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> of these letters -- these letters <unk> about 20 acids , and there &apos;s a single destiny for each of these acids .
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , sentences , thoughts .
we &apos;ve only been able to put it out .
some people were disappointed that it was not poetry .
we &apos;ve done the bits so that we were able to get them out with enzymes , and there are creatures that repair these things and together and together .
and we &apos;ve been trying to create things , starting with the <unk> letters of <unk> letters , <unk> these together to bring these together to <unk> , to <unk> this back to <unk> .
in every step , we &apos;ve done these pieces of <unk> that we could be able to deal with them because we were trying to create a very strong process of what you &apos;re going to see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of <unk> .
so , this looks like a <unk> .
if we get to this really big hands -- with about 100,000 <unk> -- they &apos;re not just going to grow in <unk> <unk> . it <unk> all of the possibilities of modern psychology , and so we were able to use ourselves other mechanisms .
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> , which is called biology to repair dna that can produce these different parts .
here &apos;s an example of this . there &apos;s a organism called <unk> <unk> of the three million <unk> of radiation .
you see in the upper field that its chromosome is just apart .
12 to 24 hours later , all over the time , it was like it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms can be completely <unk> , they can even grow in the vacuum .
i &apos;m absolutely sure that life exists in space , and it can move on the search for <unk> conditions .
in fact , nasa has shown that there are many of them there .
so here &apos;s an <unk> of the molecule that we have created by that processes -- in fact , we &apos;re used to use these processes -- in fact , we &apos;re used to be used with the right design of bits of bits of pieces of things we have .
this is not an <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s such a big molecule that we can even see it even with the <unk> .
these are photos about a dozen seconds .
this is the threat that we had just done recently .
this is about <unk> grades on <unk> code , and it &apos;s the largest molecule with <unk> structure that ever was built by people .
it has a <unk> of about 300 million .
if we were using it with a <unk> of 10 and without space , there would be <unk> pages , only to make this genetic code .
now , how do we start a chromosome ? how do we do it ?
obviously , it &apos;s very simple that it &apos;s very simple . it &apos;s a lot more complicated to deal with bacteria .
it &apos;s also easier if you &apos;re in <unk> how we &apos;re doing it : you just take the <unk> out , and there &apos;s another place in this , and that &apos;s exactly what you &apos;ve heard about .
in <unk> , the chromosome in the cell , but only recently we have shown that you can have a complete <unk> of a tumor from a cell to another , and that is able to be able to be able to be able to do this .
and we <unk> the chromosome of a <unk> . <unk> said , these two times as humans and mice . we gave a couple of <unk> that we could choose this chromosome . we put it together with enzymes to destroy all the proteins , and it was very amazing than we put it into a cell -- and they &apos;re going to see our very <unk> video here .
the new chromosome was in the cell .
in fact , we thought that this is the end , but we &apos;ve tried to get the process to make something further .
this is the <unk> of evolution here .
we find all sorts of species here that have a second chromosome , or a third of <unk> , every time of <unk> , every time of thousands of characteristics in only one second to a species of a species .
so , so people think about evolution as a gene that will be changed to a moment of biology .
there are enzymes that are called enzymes that are actually called dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell was no one ; the chromosomes that we have in common .
it was <unk> in the cell , and that &apos;s the other chromosome as a <unk> material <unk> , and so we had only one cell with a new chromosome .
it <unk> blue because of the genes that we were growing .
and after a very short time , it had been all the characteristics of species , and <unk> is completely in a new species based on the new software that we &apos;ve given in the cell .
and all the proteins are changing the <unk> -- when we read the genetic code , it was exactly what we &apos;re doing .
it might sound like <unk> <unk> , but we can do that by using the <unk> , things quite dramatic .
now , i mean that this is not the <unk> -- that &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years ago evolution .
and i &apos;ve done that we might be able to create a new form of the <unk> explosion in which there could be massive new <unk> based on this digital design .
why should we do that ?
i think it &apos;s pretty obvious about what we need .
we &apos;re about six to nine billion people in the next 40 years .
to ask it in my context : i was born in january .
today , there are three people on this planet for every one of the year , within 40 years , there will be four years in this planet .
we &apos;ve got problems with food , with healthy and clean water , medicine , <unk> to <unk> billion people .
it &apos;s going to give a challenge for nine .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion of oil . that &apos;s a hundred million on the day .
if we think about biological processes or any process to replace it , it will be a huge challenge .
then , of course , there &apos;s all the co2 from this material in the atmosphere .
we have now , from our discoveries from the entire world , a database with about 20 million genes , and i want to believe that this is the <unk> of the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components , and you can see the diversity of that was made .
we &apos;re in the first line in the first line of biological reality , and that &apos;s what our idea .
we &apos;ve got technologies today because of these fast <unk> , to do what we call <unk> genetics .
we &apos;ve got the possibility to build a big robot that can create millions of chromosomes in the day .
if you think about these 20 million different genes , or to create these processes to create <unk> or drugs new vaccines , we can only change a small team than the last 20 years of science .
and it &apos;s just <unk> selection . we can use <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is an image of the real <unk> that we &apos;re working on , where you &apos;re actually going to sit , and new species on the computer , we &apos;re going to design the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t necessarily know how to look at it . we know exactly how their genetic code will look like .
we &apos;re going to focus on the gulf of the fourth generation .
and they &apos;ve seen recently <unk> , which is just a bad experiment .
we &apos;ve got the <unk> and third generation that are relatively soon that they &apos;re going to have a lot of higher <unk> , like <unk> or different kinds of <unk> .
but , as we think , the only way of biology is a big impact without the cost of food or the <unk> of their availability , when we see co2 as a <unk> , and so we &apos;re working on cells that are going to be able to get this way out of the way , and so we &apos;re working on cells .
and we think we &apos;re going to be the first thing that we &apos;re going to be in the fourth generation of the fourth generation , and that &apos;s about 18 months ago .
and co2 and co2 are a method .
but in our discovery of the world , we have all sorts of different ways .
this is a organism that we &apos;ve described in october .
he lives in the <unk> , about <unk> miles deep , in almost <unk> <unk> .
it <unk> co2 in methane on the use of hydrogen than energy .
we &apos;re looking at if we can use <unk> co2 , which is just going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the co2 in the fuel to get the process of this process .
in a short time , we believe we could be able to solve one of the fundamental questions of life .
you know , we really have -- <unk> goals like the <unk> of all the <unk> industry . right . if you can &apos;t do that in ted , where else could be ?
but at the same time , we &apos;re working on the same way that we &apos;re going to use the same relationship for the development of geometry .
they &apos;ve seen this year with the flu , we &apos;re always a year at the back of the back , and we have a dollar , if it &apos;s about the right vaccine .
i think that it can be changed by <unk> vaccines in the <unk> .
that &apos;s how the future might look like , with changes today , today of <unk> , with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe <unk> .
we &apos;re more efficient for people to improve people . our goal is only that we have a chance to survive long enough to survive . thank you very much . thank you .
at the last ted conference , i had an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back to tell you how the machine works .
so , it &apos;s so much . and for all of those things that were not there , the lhc is the biggest scientific experiment that was ever been known -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
and the challenge is to create the conditions that less than a <unk> second for the beginning of the universe -- and that was to 600 million times within a second .
it &apos;s just <unk> .
this is the machine below hawaii .
we take pictures of this <unk> in the wild .
and this is what i &apos;m doing . he &apos;s called depression -- 44 feet in the <unk> , 22 feet in diameter .
this is a clean image of the depression in the building , so you can see the scale .
at 9 / 11 years ago , the machine was at the first time .
and this image was taken by depression .
it &apos;s built huge <unk> in the circles .
it &apos;s a picture of the first <unk> , which is the entire way around the lhc , and then <unk> with a part of the lhc <unk> to make a rain of particles on the detector on the detector .
in other words , when we looked at this picture at 9 / 11 , we knew that the machine works , which is a big triumph .
i don &apos;t know if this is the biggest <unk> , or this , as someone who went to the google side , and the front of the audience looked like this .
it means that we have a cultural influence next to the scientific .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had a problem with the machine here -- this golden wires here .
these wires <unk> <unk> <unk> when the machine is on <unk> .
now , the engineers are going to look at them and say , &quot; no one doesn &apos;t do it . these are little wires . &quot;
you can afford that , because if you &apos;re very much <unk> , you &apos;re going to be called <unk> .
so , in the <unk> degree degree , polio than the space between the stars , these wires are <unk> .
in one of the connections , between <unk> <unk> in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
and that &apos;s going to come down to the wires and <unk> <unk> , suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , this is just amazing when you imagine that the <unk> of 20 tons , and it &apos;s about about 30 centimeters .
so we <unk> about 50 of the night .
and they had to put them out what we did .
we <unk> them together , <unk> them .
they &apos;re all back to your way back on your way .
for the end of march , the lhc is going to be <unk> .
we &apos;re going to take it down and expect to expect the first data in june or july , and we &apos;re going through our journey to figure out what the building of the universe are .
well , of course , on a kind of <unk> , there &apos;s a way of the debate about the value of science and <unk> on these boundaries , and it &apos;s easy to be able to get something like this .
i think the fact that it &apos;s so hard to see the fact that we &apos;re going to take out of our borders , the value of things like the lhc .
i &apos;m going to leave my <unk> words of a english scientist . <unk> <unk> , who said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of the human mind , and he said , &quot; nothing is so dangerous for the development of human mind , as to believe that our scientific ideas are <unk> , and that it doesn &apos;t have a new worlds . &quot;
thank you .
i am writer .
schools , my profession is my profession , but it &apos;s more than that .
it &apos;s also my big , with love and fascination .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s going to change .
but in fact , i &apos;ve done something wrong in my life and my career , which led me to be able to do this work .
now , this <unk> event was that i wrote a book ago -- a <unk> named <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love different than all my previous books from some reasons in the world , and a big <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i &apos;m not going to be treated where i &apos;m going to be treated as if i was going to be treated .
seriously -- the <unk> <unk> !
for example , it &apos;s really worried about me and say , &quot; don &apos;t you know that they &apos;re never going to be <unk> ?
don &apos;t they be afraid that they &apos;re <unk> their entire life , and i never create a book that i &apos;m interested in in the world ? never back ? <unk> ?
okay , this is really the courage .
it would be worse , if i didn &apos;t remind me that i was about 20 years ago , when i told a teenager , when i told a teenager , that i wanted to be writer with the same kind of <unk> response .
people said , <unk> , you don &apos;t have fear , never to have failure ?
are you not afraid you &apos;re going to give you the fear of a <unk> ?
don &apos;t you know that , you know , you &apos;re going to <unk> your life , and you never have to die that you &apos;re going to die on a <unk> <unk> dreams -- your mouth is filled with the <unk> of failure ?
so , you know , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on all these questions is : <unk> yes .
yeah , i &apos;m afraid of all these things .
and i &apos;ve always had that .
and i have a lot more things that nobody would be afraid to do .
like algae -- and other <unk> things .
but , if it &apos;s about writing , i &apos;ve been thinking about this , and i ask myself , why ?
is that true ?
is it inevitable that of somebody would be expected to do that he was afraid to do the work that he feels ?
and what &apos;s right now with the creative <unk> , that they &apos;re willing to be insecure about the <unk> of energy -- in a way , how else doesn &apos;t do it ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can &apos;t remember a situation in his 40 years as a chemist , where he was asked to be afraid to be a chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how do you do it ?
it just didn &apos;t come out , do you know ?
but to be fair -- the group of the chemist has not been able to get the reputation of <unk> <unk> people .
but we were afraid to have this kind of reputation , but not only the 1960s , but the creative of all <unk> , it seem to be able to have this reputation to be very honest .
all you need to do is to be able to look at the <unk> of really great head from the 20th century , the young and often died of their hand .
and even the people who don &apos;t actually have <unk> , was really <unk> by their talents .
peter <unk> said shortly about his death in his last interview : <unk> , every one of my books had killed me a little bit .
a extraordinary statement that you can do about your life .
but we don &apos;t even see if we hear somebody like something like that , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of clip for that , because we &apos;ve seen this kind of <unk> , and interestingly , that art is kind of <unk> , and that art is kind of <unk> , and that art -- in the end of the time , is always <unk> .
the question that i &apos;m going to ask today is : is this idea for you all right ?
do you think about that ? because with just a mile away , i feel that i don &apos;t even think about it .
and i think they have <unk> .
and i think it &apos;s dangerous . and i don &apos;t want to watch how to get in the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our big creative support of life .
and i definitely know that it was for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous , to start , this dark way of <unk> <unk> -- especially in the fact that i &apos;m interested in my career in my career right now .
this means , you see , i &apos;m pretty young . i &apos;m just about 40 years old .
i may have a few 40 <unk> in me .
and it &apos;s extremely likely that everything i &apos;m going to write about now is about the world as the work is not going to be <unk> by the <unk> of my last book , right ?
i &apos;m going to say it <unk> , because we &apos;re now all kind of friends -- it &apos;s very likely to be my biggest success behind me .
oh jesus , jesus , what &apos;s a thought !
these are the kind of thought that someone can bring someone to read to nine o &apos;clock in the morning , <unk> , and i don &apos;t want to do .
i would like to spend this work that i love to love .
so the question is : how ?
after some time , the <unk> is , i think i could continue to write a way to write a kind of <unk> psychological <unk> .
now , i have to find out of a way to be able to write a safe distance between me and my very natural <unk> about how the reaction is going to be in the <unk> .
and in the past year , i &apos;ve been trying to do this to do this , and i &apos;ve tried to see other societies , and i tried to find other other societies , to see if you can help creative or <unk> ideas about how to help creative risks that are connected to creativity .
this <unk> led me to be in the old bears and the old rome .
please follow me , because the circle is going to go back .
but in the old bears and rome , people don &apos;t believe that creativity is that creativity is going to come from people , ok ?
they believed that creativity was a kind of <unk> <unk> , which was from one distant , unknown source to the people -- from <unk> , <unk> reasons .
the greeks called this <unk> <unk> of creativity <unk> <unk> .
now , <unk> is known that he thought he would have a <unk> , he had a <unk> , which was <unk> .
the <unk> had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative mind a <unk> genius .
this is great . the <unk> didn &apos;t really thought that a genius was a very strong individual .
and they thought that a genius of this kind of magic <unk> nature was that it could be literally in the walls of a <unk> -- about as <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> , and the artists in the work of the work that would make the result of work .
this is brilliant -- there &apos;s the distance that i talked about -- the psychological movement that i talked about -- the power of your work .
and everybody knew that it worked so well , right ?
the artists of the <unk> was about some things , like , like , for example , for example , right ?
if your work was brilliant , you couldn &apos;t look at all of you . everybody knew that you knew this <unk> genius had helped you .
if your work <unk> -- not completely your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew your genius was something .
so the people in the west really thought about creativity .
and then the renaissance and everything changed . we had this big idea . and this big idea was : let &apos;s take the human individual in the center of the universe -- over all gods and mystery , and there is no space for <unk> creatures that are looking at the <unk> .
it &apos;s the beginning of rational <unk> , and the people started thinking that creativity was completely from their own individual .
for the first time in history , you hear people like this , or these artists call a genius -- instead of that he has a genius .
i have to tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , you know , to give a naked person that he thinks , or it &apos;s like the <unk> , like the <unk> and the essence of all <unk> , creative , <unk> , <unk> , is a little bit more responsible for a lot of responsibility to make them a <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like somebody to ask someone the sun .
and the <unk> and <unk> of all the <unk> , and it creates all these <unk> expectations of success .
i think that this <unk> of our artists have <unk> our artists in the last 500 years .
and , if this is true , and i think it &apos;s true -- is the question .
can we change it ?
maybe a japanese understanding about the relationship between people and the mystery of the creative home .
maybe not .
maybe we can change the <unk> of 500 years , not just <unk> in a <unk> talk .
and there &apos;s certainly people in this audience that are really <unk> scientific headlines about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc .
i &apos;m probably not going to take all of you on this journey .
but the question that i want to give you is why not ?
why not this matter ?
because it &apos;s just a lot of sense of how anything else i heard when it started to explain that absolutely crazy <unk> of the creative process of the creative process .
so one process that -- as everybody knows , you &apos;ve ever tried to do something -- so in other words , you &apos;re not going to do something .
and in fact , he can &apos;t feel <unk> .
i had recently had this kind of encounter , as i met the extraordinary american poet <unk> , which is now about 90 years ago , and she told me that she was born in the <unk> virginia , and she said she was going to be in the <unk> virginia , and she said she would feel like a poem about the landscape on them .
she said it would be like a <unk> train out of air .
the country on them would be <unk> .
she felt when it came out , because it would be the earth under their feet to <unk> .
they knew that she could only do a moment in a moment , and that was -- in your words -- <unk> <unk> like the devil <unk> .
they went like the devil to the house while she was <unk> by this poem , and it was only about this poem that she had to get fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen , so she had to get it through it through it , and it was able to get it on the sheet .
in other words , they weren &apos;t quick enough . she went and went and went to the house , but she was going to go to the house , and she was going to put it up . she said it would go around the country , and -- as they said -- <unk> after a different poet <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part i &apos;m never forgotten -- she said that there was moments in which they were almost to do it .
so , she goes to the house , and i &apos;m going to go back to the paper , and the poem goes through them , and she <unk> a pen than it <unk> , and then -- she said -- it was like that , with their other hand , and then you get to put it into it .
they took the poem on his tail and moved it back into their body and took it back to the piece of paper .
and in these ways , the poem came up , and <unk> on the paper -- but backwards -- from the last word to the first .
and when i heard that , i thought that &apos;s <unk> -- that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is going to be in .
that &apos;s not like my creative process -- i &apos;m not the insect !
i &apos;m a <unk> . i &apos;ve got to work on the same time every day to come up to the same time , and <unk> , and really <unk> , and really <unk> .
but even though i was in my <unk> , sometimes this thing was <unk> .
and i think many of you have done that many of you have done .
even i had work or ideas that have been from a source through me that i don &apos;t really know .
what is this thing ?
and how do we do that in relation to the relationship without losing our mind , but we &apos;re in the opposite , even in the opposite of your own health ?
so to me , the best living example of how you can do this is the musician of tom <unk> , and i had to put it back a couple of years ago for a magazine .
we talked about this topic . and you know what ? the most of his life was <unk> the embodiment of <unk> modern artists , who tried to do these <unk> creative areas that died in it , and with them , with them .
but then he was older , and he said , he told me that he had one day in the <unk> in los angeles , and it changed all the time for him .
he went out with high speed as he suddenly looked at a little <unk> of a press , which is how it &apos;s often <unk> to him , and he wants them . it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> , but he doesn &apos;t make them .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen , he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> .
so he starts to take this old <unk> in him , like , like <unk> , i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and i &apos;m going to be <unk> by this song .
i &apos;m not good enough , i don &apos;t create it .
but instead of <unk> , he just heard about it .
he ended up all the time and did something completely new .
he just looked at the sky and said , <unk> me , can &apos;t you see that i &apos;m going to get a car ?
in fact , i see that , as a song , i &apos;m going to see a song ?
if you really want to exist , you &apos;re going to come back to a <unk> moment , if i can do myself .
if you don &apos;t , <unk> today , someone else .
come and <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> .
his whole <unk> has changed the way that we &apos;ve done .
not the work itself . that was often as dark as ever .
but the process and the awful <unk> , which is , it was <unk> when he had the genius of what he was doing , and he took it out of what he was doing , and he realized that it was not the <unk> , <unk> thing to be , he didn &apos;t have to be <unk> .
it could be a <unk> , magic , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and the <unk> , <unk> thing , that wasn &apos;t very <unk> .
when i heard this story , it was also a little bit of the way i worked , and it has been killed me .
now , this idea was , as i was sitting in the middle of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , love <unk> , and i was sitting in one of these things , and it &apos;s not going to do it . you &apos;re trying to think that it &apos;s going to be a disaster . this is going to be the worst book . it &apos;s going to be the worst book .
not just bad , but the worst of all ages .
i started thinking , i should make the project easy .
but then i remembered , like tom in the <unk> sky , and i was trying to do it .
so i took my view from the woods , and i talked about my girlfriend in the way of a empty corner of the space .
i was talking about it : <unk> , you know , you and i know , if this book is not brilliant , that it &apos;s not completely fun that it &apos;s not full of me , right ?
because you see that i have all the things that i have , i don &apos;t have more than this . i don &apos;t have more than that .
so if you want to have better , you &apos;ve got to come here , and you &apos;ve got to get your percentage of vision .
okay . but if you don &apos;t do that -- you know what the devil is .
i &apos;m going to write again , because this is my job .
and i want to give you the <unk> that i &apos;ve been here today for my part of the jobs here .
because ... at the end of the end , it &apos;s like <unk> . ago , we &apos;ve been able to go into the coast of <unk> people with poland <unk> and music <unk> , who died for hours -- to university .
these are always amazing , because the dancers were <unk> , and they were fantastic .
but down and again , very rare , happened something special . one of the students was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know what i mean , because i know that you &apos;re all in your life , you &apos;ve seen one of the performance .
it was like the time of <unk> and the dancer through a kind of <unk> , and he did nothing differently than he had ever done it before , 1,000 nights ago , but everything has created together .
and suddenly , he wasn &apos;t going to be in human beings .
he was <unk> from inside of the bottom and the bottom of the bottom , and everything <unk> through a <unk> fire .
so , as something happened at that time , people knew what that was . they called it to his name .
they put the hands together and started to sing , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , god , god .
this is god , you know ?
so what we did is <unk> <unk> : as the <unk> <unk> <unk> , they made this <unk> . the <unk> changed in the time of <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , you can still hear in <unk> and <unk> .
when a week in spain , something interesting has done something like this : <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , it is : a <unk> look at god .
and this is great , because we need that .
but , in the next morning , the next morning , when the dancer was reading , and i realized that it was 11 o &apos;clock in a tuesday -- and he doesn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> of god in it .
it &apos;s just a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> , and maybe he &apos;s never going to get back to this <unk> .
and maybe someone will never call somebody &apos;s name , if it turns out . but what do he want to do with the rest of his life ?
that &apos;s hard .
this is one of the most <unk> <unk> of a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be so <unk> , if you didn &apos;t believe in the beginning of the beginning that the most popular aspects of their client came from them .
if you may only believe that they &apos;re a <unk> -- from a <unk> source for a <unk> time of your life that &apos;s going to be taken to someone else , if they &apos;re doing it .
if we start thinking about this , it changes everything .
so i started thinking , and so i think i &apos;m working with security in the past months while i was working on the book that &apos;s going to be <unk> -- as the dangerous , confusing , <unk> , <unk> of my <unk> <unk> .
what i have to tell myself is , if i &apos;m mad , i &apos;m not afraid to think about it , i &apos;m not afraid .
not impossible .
just just your job .
it &apos;s going to be used for your <unk> , which is still going to be .
if your job is the dance , dance .
if it &apos;s the bad <unk> genius that you &apos;re going to go to the side , for a short moment to show a way of miracle of miracle through your effort , then <unk> <unk> !
and if you don &apos;t go , and then your dance , you know .
and <unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you through all of this .
i believe that , and i think we should teach that .
<unk> <unk> ! <unk> for you through all of this , just for me that you know the only human love and the <unk> had to be there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i &apos;ve shown this two slides to show that the <unk> <unk> , which is that the <unk> <unk> , which is the size of the bottom <unk> states , about 40 percent .
but this is not strong enough the methane of this particular problem , because it &apos;s not the <unk> of ice .
in some sense , the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> heart of our global <unk> .
it grows in the winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide i &apos;m going to show you is a <unk> which is happening in the last 25 years .
the <unk> is <unk> with red <unk> .
as you see , it grows to the <unk> . this is the <unk> ice in winter , and it &apos;s the <unk> of the summer .
this is called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood from the body here .
in 25 years , it &apos;s going to be disappeared by here .
this is a problem , because the warming is the frozen reason about the arctic ocean , in which there are big amounts of <unk> carbon , which , if he &apos;s <unk> , from microbes to methane .
with the entire amount of <unk> connection in the atmosphere , we could use this amount of <unk> , if we &apos;re going to use this critical point .
today , <unk> in a couple of flat lakes in alaska is methane from itself from the water .
professor <unk> , in alaska , in alaska , in alaska , with a different centimeter in a different <unk> lake in the winter .
wow !
it &apos;s good . the question is , how will it be <unk> .
and one reason is , this enormous campaign <unk> greenland from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the state is much bigger than ever before .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know how the level of the country is going through <unk> , they <unk> in the ocean .
these rivers are going to be <unk> .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month ago , the entire continent , the entire continent has been a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , which is about a couple of <unk> <unk> , is particularly strong in the <unk> .
this is about 20 feet <unk> , like greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see , you see new lakes , which was over a couple of years ago .
30 percent of all the people on the world , half of their <unk> <unk> .
in the <unk> , this <unk> is the <unk> for this city .
the <unk> have <unk> .
but when they <unk> , it &apos;s going to be the majority of the water .
in california , a 40 percent has seen a 40 percent .
this is the <unk> .
and the predictions of how they read them are seriously .
this <unk> in the entire world is designed to be able to fire in a dramatic way of fire .
and the disaster all over the world has been in a really <unk> , and i never have <unk> insight .
so many hundred years a lot in the last 30 years , as many of the last 30 years .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you look at this in historical context , you can see what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we &apos;ve been 70 million tons of co2 , all 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
now look at the area of the east coast of the west , from the american continent , and <unk> of the indian <unk> , where there is a <unk> decline of oxygen in the ocean .
the biggest individual factor for global warming , next to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the <unk> of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most important problem .
the united states is one of the two major <unk> , together with china .
and the proposal was to build a lot of other <unk> .
but we start to see a change .
here are the ones that were <unk> in the last couple of years , with some green alternatives that were mentioned .
<unk> , there &apos;s a political <unk> in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> has spent a <unk> dollars last year to <unk> clean coal , which is already a <unk> .
this picture reminded me about something .
at christmas books , at my home , at my home in tennessee , a billion tons of <unk> .
they &apos;ve seen it <unk> in the news .
this is in our entire country in our entire country of <unk> america .
this happened about christmas .
one of the <unk> of the <unk> on christmas was this .
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> , quiet guy .
it gives it into <unk> and <unk> in america , and he helps to grow our economy .
<unk> , the <unk> is going to be clean every day .
it &apos;s affordable and <unk> , and workers are going to stay in <unk> and bread .
this is the source of most coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the head of <unk> <unk> .
let me tell you a very clear . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , harry <unk> , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so , the <unk> of humanity has two tribes in life .
this is a part of her .
in the <unk> , we see climate change as a serious danger for our business .
that &apos;s why we took us to the top of the <unk> , to spend a <unk> <unk> to get a <unk> on the way that the truth about coal .
in fact , coal is not emotional .
we believe it &apos;s clean -- and it doesn &apos;t seem much good .
so , you don &apos;t worry about climate change .
so , let &apos;s take that quiet to us .
<unk> coal , they &apos;ve heard a lot of it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this modern , emotional <unk> .
fantastic ! this machine is pretty , pretty much .
but it &apos;s the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet , there &apos;s one of coal is one of the world &apos;s global warming , which is the remarkable clean <unk> that you see here is changing all .
look at it right now , this is the <unk> , clean <unk> .
and finally , the positive alternative with our economic challenge , and our current challenge of national security , and our challenge of national security .
america is in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the red collection that all the <unk> , is our dependence on <unk> movements like <unk> coal and <unk> oil .
but now , there &apos;s a radical , new solution to get us out of this <unk> .
<unk> america with 100 percent clean electricity , within the next 10 years .
so a plan to make america back to work to make us safer and help the global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
<unk> america . find more out of it .
this is the last .
it &apos;s about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence of old , open emissions , which is our world , to reduce our world .
the future is here . wind , sun and a new system .
new investment , to create good jobs .
<unk> america &apos;s new . it &apos;s time to accept reality .
there &apos;s a old african world , &quot; if you want to be quick , go alone .
if you want to come back , go together . &quot;
we need to come back , and that &apos;s fast .
thank you .
i want to start to ask you to ask them the time of their childhood , when they were born with <unk> .
as they realized how to <unk> the hands and <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and moving , they actually learned to think of thinking , to think of the problems and change .
the public thinking is very closely connected to how we understand a lot of our environment .
as a child , inspired by the way of our interaction with real objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> , i began to wonder : what if we could use computers to be able to make a <unk> <unk> -- -- what if we could put together with both hands and data , and it could be able to build it so much , how do we want to do it ?
this question was so <unk> that we decided to explore the answer of the answer and <unk> .
so , i said , a <unk> is a <unk> computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can move through the hand , you can see each other , you can see your movements , and you have a screen and a <unk> .
and more importantly , they &apos;re <unk> , why you &apos;re just like <unk> , only through the hands and access to the hands .
and the <unk> is a example of a new generation of <unk> to the <unk> digital data .
and if these tools are physical , and you &apos;re going to develop a consciousness for their movements , to see each other and the <unk> of our <unk> with them , then we can start with the study of new and <unk> .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> , and if i put it into a direction , the video is going to go back to the video , and if i put it into the other direction , it goes backwards .
and these interactive portraits will be true each other .
so if i put them down to the other hand , your interest is going to work .
if you &apos;re <unk> , you can see it also , and you can see something nervous .
and they also feel their movements and <unk> .
a interesting part of the interactions that we started to realize was that we could use different gestures on data , how to <unk> colors like you &apos;re doing this with <unk> .
in this case , we have three <unk> than <unk> <unk> , and i can use them to use color in the middle of the middle , where they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
if we <unk> it , we can make a little <unk> .
and there &apos;s also some nice possibilities in education like languages , mathematics or <unk> , where we &apos;re going to give people the possibility of fast , and we &apos;re going to see the results look at it .
so here i am -- this is a number that i &apos;m going to do with a simple <unk> .
this is a game with words , which is a kind of <unk> from <unk> and <unk> .
in fact , you &apos;re looking at every round of <unk> letters , and while you &apos;re trying to create words , this is about a dictionary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it becomes <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a new <unk> and a new possibility .
thank you .
these are some children who came up on a day to the media lab , and i could move them to it , and i took a video of it .
they really loved it .
one more interesting thing about this kind of applications is that you don &apos;t have to give people a lot of instructions .
all you have to say is &quot; <unk> words , &quot; and you know exactly what to do .
here &apos;s a couple of people who test it .
this is our <unk> <unk> in the bottom right .
it turns out that he was just going to <unk> the <unk> .
so for him , they were only <unk> .
this is a interactive <unk> .
we wanted to develop a <unk> for <unk> .
this is <unk> .
he can bring new characters into the scene by the <unk> of the table by the table of the table , which shows this character .
this is what he does the sun .
the sun goes on .
now , he &apos;s going to take a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yeah !
when he says the <unk> , and they put them down the characters to interact with the characters .
... his own story .
hello !
it &apos;s a story with your head , and he can decide how they evolved .
a cat cat .
the last example that i &apos;ve been here today is to show it is an <unk> for <unk> , which we &apos;ve developed recently , and in the <unk> as sound , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> .
every one has four different rooms ; you can choose what you want to use .
and you can see these sounds in the sequence of the sequence that you can do in any patterns .
and you put them down , you &apos;re just going to get a <unk> on a <unk> .
there are effects that you can change live in life like , like hall and filter .
you put it up with a certain tone , and it &apos;s called him to call him the <unk> .
and then there &apos;s <unk> effects like the speed and <unk> that you &apos;re going to do on the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s look at it .
we &apos;re starting to see the <unk> in two <unk> <unk> , and this is in a series of <unk> , and you can use a little bit more about the voice of the voice .
now , i &apos;m going to put a <unk> .
now i &apos;m going to do something .
and now , i got the filters with the <unk> , so i can control the effect of life .
i can accelerate the whole sequence , by the speed of the pace of a car or another direction .
and now , i &apos;m going to get the filters out there with the <unk> , for something more expression .
i can see the sequence as they &apos;re going to happen .
that &apos;s why i don &apos;t have to do it in the employees , but it can <unk> it , and you can <unk> them .
and at the end , i can <unk> the whole sequence , by the bottom of the left .
thank you .
so as you can see , my <unk> is to develop new <unk> , which is better to change how our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you a part of this new <unk> and some of the possibilities that we &apos;re working in our lab .
the idea that i want to give you with the way is that we &apos;re going to be on the <unk> to this new generation of <unk> to interaction with digital media , the information in our world , which is what we &apos;re doing in our world .
thank you .
i &apos;m happy to talk to you all of you .
yeah , good day .
i &apos;m happy to me that i &apos;m there .
yeah , so , what &apos;s going to be <unk> ?
i &apos;ve got to get a little <unk> , and this is going to be <unk> with the modern designs .
i study materials , and i &apos;ve been here for a few years ago with the <unk> , and i started thinking , because i just wanted to know more , and i wanted to do it , and i wanted to do what i wanted to do in the past .
so , this was my primary motivation .
so , it was a curiosity , and i wanted to get closer to the matter of matter .
so , i think the designs in the general now , that &apos;s very much talking about <unk> , <unk> , all of what you &apos;re thinking about synthetic biology and so forth .
it &apos;s really important , now is extremely important , and it &apos;s much more important , much more important in the future .
there are so different things like this entire <unk> changes in the <unk> .
there are craig venter now in the <unk> , who tries to create <unk> , so gas from algae .
in fact , there are things that are completely different in the lives , which is the most important thing that most people are not aware of , for example , <unk> that allow us to <unk> with 20,000 degrees , are also <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and the list is able to continue the list of <unk> .
and so from the interest of the interest of this technology , i &apos;m going to go back to <unk> .
so what does it look like ?
most people know that most people know about the <unk> .
what we &apos;re doing , and then it &apos;s always going to be in the media , yes , the process is in front of a <unk> and <unk> data , and so on .
so this is kind of a very sad thing for the <unk> , because that &apos;s not what they &apos;re doing , which is what they actually did , and what &apos;s actually going on .
and this is the <unk> , in the &apos; 70s , <unk> with <unk> , and it &apos;s also the internet .
and it &apos;s about , with a <unk> , creative , <unk> way to solve a problem .
and the problem , this is not just a massive problem , it can also be a social problem , it &apos;s also easy to make things like things like things , so that &apos;s a <unk> , a question <unk> , and how can you do it differently or how to make it better .
and it &apos;s been <unk> with software , but there &apos;s also in the <unk> , there &apos;s also a whole <unk> , and there &apos;s also a whole <unk> that we &apos;re doing with <unk> all sorts of <unk> things .
and now , in the way of biology , and there i want to do this metaphor that &apos;s going to go out of synthetic biology , because biology is actually a <unk> code , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , because it &apos;s dynamic , it &apos;s true , it &apos;s true , and not only <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a code , and that &apos;s what you can do , and you can put it down , and that &apos;s what i found is incredibly fascinating , and that &apos;s what i found was incredibly fascinating , and i just wanted to get a lot deeper .
and that &apos;s actually just <unk> eight of the fact that these networks .
there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , which is the beginning of switzerland , which is in europe and with a cooperation in india <unk> network , but now members or active people all over the world .
that &apos;s what &apos;s got a more chaos , so there &apos;s a lot of artists and philosophers , in collaboration with scientists with these technologies and questions and to ask the creative , because there is <unk> , and there &apos;s all kinds of things .
but it &apos;s actually always about how to find a <unk> access to find such a <unk> <unk> .
and then there &apos;s <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
this is from the <unk> of a network , which is actually more so much more like a kind of <unk> where you &apos;re going to look at it and play online .
this is a little bit more powerful , and also a little bit of <unk> , and then there &apos;s a little bit like this , you know , <unk> questions .
and from these networks that have done all the truth that the whole thing has done is that the scene that i &apos;d like to do is <unk> .
here in the image left on the left , you see <unk> , which is an <unk> , so , in principle , a way of school , a private school , a farmer &apos;s <unk> , where everybody can do .
children , old , all sorts of people go back to the same time , just to get a lab , and you &apos;re looking at what you can do when you &apos;re doing this <unk> .
on the left , a group of indonesia is a group in indonesia , <unk> means that there &apos;s already a lot of long .
only longer than these other are both networks .
they &apos;re also in such a artistic perspective with biological materials and , yes , <unk> , and we &apos;re using this in a pretty <unk> way .
a group of reactions that i &apos;d like to have met a long time ago , which is that one of the things that i want to do is want to give the public , what you want to learn to the public , and they &apos;ve been able to tell people about what &apos;s <unk> , and they &apos;re trying to explain what <unk> is .
and i got on on the other image of a lecture in copenhagen in copenhagen in the medical museum in copenhagen in the medical museum .
and this is , of course , that &apos;s probably very young people , but the only thing that we &apos;re doing is that the idea of what &apos;s going on , this was this career in the technology .
and what you can do to do with that , and i &apos;m also able to ask the society to the society and ask questions , so okay , what do you want to do with you , you &apos;ve got your interest on it , you know ?
so , <unk> , to <unk> biology , you need to make material material .
you need biological materials , of course , and you need to have tools , and this is a lab .
so , what you &apos;re going to understand under a lab , that &apos;s so kind of <unk> machines , extremely expensive , extremely sensitive , just for <unk> , <unk> <unk> with <unk> and so forth .
and our approach was to say , to say , <unk> , that actually doesn &apos;t have to do that .
that &apos;s actually not necessary because every one of each other <unk> has been actually more developed technology than most <unk> , which is really so much .
and it &apos;s like this premise with this premise that , for example , nick <unk> in england , a <unk> <unk> , and then a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> and , yes , so <unk> , and that &apos;s what the bacteria are doing , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
so every one that &apos;s already a version of a soup , which he &apos;s written for a long time , has done it , even even done .
i tried that in my lab home , a little bit , and then i got to go back to ebay , and i took a little <unk> analysis , trying to do a little <unk> analysis , to get a <unk> , so that &apos;s like that .
now , this should be not a joke , but it &apos;s not going to be a joke .
on the bottom of the picture , you see the lab , in <unk> , so that &apos;s such a <unk> garage , and this is such an <unk> garage , which is a group in paris , which has a group in paris , and it &apos;s pretty exciting things , and i want to do a project .
and this is <unk> , which is also <unk> <unk> , this is , this is such a kind of <unk> in principle for molecular biology .
and yes , you can see , it &apos;s relatively relatively <unk> , so that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do is to get out of people who are going to do it alone , to be able to get bigger organizations , they &apos;re going to be able to be able to do it in <unk> form .
but it &apos;s always always the idea that it &apos;s going to be easy and to be free .
the first project that we &apos;ve done as the international group that we &apos;ve done is that we &apos;ve been able to be aware of our self , <unk> , and we &apos;re online , and we &apos;re online , and we know that the people who are always <unk> , and that &apos;s how we know .
and then , of course , from the <unk> <unk> website of the founder , and he said , well , we &apos;ve got to be able to do a lot of <unk> , and we &apos;ve got to have two events , one in london , <unk> 10 events , and just just on the <unk> , in san francisco .
and then , in fact , it turns out , yes , <unk> , who are we , what are we going to say , what do we want to say , what do we want to tell ?
and what are our values and what are our selection , our basis ?
and there we have to be <unk> as a <unk> .
that was really intuitive , so every one has just been like his wishes , his <unk> , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to look at .
here , my opinion , i think i &apos;m going to do a very good code .
and that &apos;s why we know , it &apos;s not <unk> , but that &apos;s like , i think there &apos;s relatively good <unk> that people are right there .
and we even tried to do that in the muslim world , but there &apos;s something that &apos;s actually not going to be done in the muslim world , but there &apos;s something like this .
so i think we &apos;re from the <unk> , in fact , even a step further than the muslim world .
yeah , what do we do for projects now ?
a project that i &apos;ve done with the <unk> in switzerland was that we &apos;ve done a so-called optical <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s when you look at a <unk> , on one in the room , you can make little particles in the air or in the liquid and then , in the liquid , and then , in this focus , it goes down there , so that &apos;s like this , as a <unk> in principle .
it really works that this is going to be done in the academic <unk> , and we thought , <unk> , you might have a <unk> , the <unk> , the lens <unk> , the lens <unk> , and then you have a microscope , which is <unk> .
this is what you see on the bottom .
and then we &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> , and then i tried to focus on this camera .
and unfortunately , it doesn &apos;t have been done , but we &apos;ve learned a lot of time .
this is another project that &apos;s from the french group of paris , which has been in paris , that &apos;s pretty cool .
and this is what it &apos;s like , so , this is something like this , like a <unk> , or so something , he &apos;s going to work with <unk> <unk> , his <unk> <unk> is sam <unk> .
he took this helmet this helmet , and in the back of cooperation with the museum , it came to the museum .
and then , there could be <unk> in the room in the room , sitting on this chair to put this helmet .
then they were measured , and they were the <unk> , and as you thought , or as you thought , there are different risks in the room .
it &apos;s a pretty amazing project .
another thing from the united states , which is also what &apos;s going to have to do with this <unk> , is the <unk> , that &apos;s the <unk> , complicated word .
so it &apos;s about to copy genes , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and you can make it visible .
so , if i &apos;m going to do that , i &apos;m going to put the <unk> in the scene , and then you go down there , and then you &apos;re going to be able to do this method , and then you can tell you , <unk> , that hair is going to be seen with this people , like this .
and the machines that make something like something that are pretty expensive , which is pretty expensive to be <unk> , the <unk> will go to <unk> euros .
and that &apos;s not in <unk> , but it &apos;s a really cool technology , but it &apos;s a really cool technology that can also be very much .
so this is just a application of many of the things that you can do with it .
so , there &apos;s so two two <unk> <unk> and said , <unk> , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing to do , and we &apos;ve got <unk> , so we have <unk> activity , which is <unk> , that this device is <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to do it , and they &apos;re now the <unk> <unk> of these devices in the world .
i think sort of like six dollars or something like this .
but in every case , it &apos;s still not cheap , but it &apos;s on every case in a process where it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
so , i think it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> .
a project that i was starting to start was to build a <unk> .
<unk> is , yes , like this kind of <unk> , which is about so far , two centimeters or something like that .
and they <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> , and then the <unk> , and then i put it down to <unk> , and then i &apos;ve got the <unk> , and then you put that up to it .
so the device that you see there is not going to work .
but this is so my prototype of my prototype , but it was pretty much <unk> , so this is like a chaos , which is the thing to get electronics and pressure , and that was the pressure of the pressure , the thing is broken .
and then i took a <unk> , and i put it on it .
a <unk> , if you make the full of power with water , that &apos;s enough pressure , so i think , like 24 to <unk> , about it .
and so you can make the particles very much enough , and then they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to do it .
and the commercial device costs about <unk> euros , or something like that , <unk> as something like 50 .
so , it doesn &apos;t have the same efficiency , but it &apos;s also the principle .
and so this is what &apos;s going to be in the moment that the <unk> of the scene is to increase these availability of technology , and also the information and the <unk> , that more people can get there .
because , as the beginning said , it &apos;s a extremely important technology , and most people have relatively little idea , and most people don &apos;t have a chance to create .
because when you read about it , from <unk> , that &apos;s not the same thing that if you &apos;ve done it , or you &apos;ve seen it .
and i think technology will always be more important in our modern societies .
and if you want to have a <unk> citizen , you want to meet complex decisions in society , and they want to make the access to know , you need to know the access to know and the technology .
and you have to do it , and you need to understand it and understand it .
and then the <unk> , and then , under the <unk> open <unk> and network science .
so that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do with these scientific technologies .
and this is the <unk> of the <unk> .
these are the people who was at least <unk> on the website , <unk> website .
that &apos;s already a relatively amazing number of people around the world .
and the interesting thing is that they &apos;re also seen in asia .
i think that &apos;s because there are fewer people who exist than actually exist .
so i know about some people who don &apos;t have harvard .
and that &apos;s just the <unk> , the individual people .
in fact , with these <unk> , these places together , so these places together .
and this is the beginning of the beginning .
as i said , <unk> has just begun .
and <unk> , so the <unk> , because the <unk> in berlin was the first , <unk> .
and this is now a huge network of very good , yes , it &apos;s used to be <unk> that the world are <unk> everywhere in the world .
and we hope , of course , that we &apos;re looking at the way that we &apos;re looking at , and then the way we &apos;re doing so well , so that &apos;s how much more important people can be involved in .
and i would invite every time to deal with it , and then even to try and figure out what &apos;s going on .
it &apos;s not so simple , but it &apos;s not impossible if you have enough curiosity , and it doesn &apos;t matter if you have enough curiosity and it &apos;s enough energy , then you get out there .
thank you for listening .
that &apos;s it .
yeah , hello .
how are we going to work ?
this is a question that &apos;s very moving to me as an expert , but also in the area of <unk> <unk> , and all of the things in the area of the <unk> .
and it &apos;s about how to get people in interactive media so they can use these interactive media , and so they create a <unk> experience .
so , i think that the interactive media in us are <unk> , cognitive models , and so the paradigm of our biological memory is very , very , very long time , and that we can only get the way out of interactive media .
and this is very amazing because you believe that this <unk> , which you &apos;re seeing here is that this <unk> is actually going to be in the future , but in fact , it &apos;s so that the future is the future of us , in our <unk> roots .
so what are happening now , right now ?
i &apos;ve got four <unk> <unk> , and i want to tell you a little bit about it .
we have cognitive models , and that &apos;s the technology that we have in the <unk> times that we have <unk> .
and in this <unk> models , we &apos;ve heard that we have a really natural relationship to <unk> .
and this sounds actually looks kind of <unk> .
but i &apos;m going to go back to the same time , and i &apos;m going to prove you from trying to prove that they have a natural relationship with <unk> .
the second thing is that we &apos;re interested in because of these <unk> models that are very , very much to talk very much to talk , even though we use a <unk> language .
and the third area that tells you about itself .
we all know that the interactive media of definition are <unk> , which is what the cause of the essence is , and what &apos;s why , of course , is that we know that we &apos;re going to make the essence today as normal .
the fourth point is that the story for us is a place of <unk> .
now , this is what &apos;s going on with the <unk> , which is actually the most important thing about the world .
i want to show you that way .
how many doors has the house where they live ?
we &apos;re not going to answer them to me , but it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s going to happen in the moment .
they go through this house through this house , in <unk> you live , and look at how many doors there are .
and that &apos;s exactly what they do .
they <unk> the reality , and it &apos;s not a computer .
great , right ?
and we &apos;re going to give us better at the <unk> , for example , the virtual reality in our <unk> , we can actually do that all the time .
and this is that this wealth of wealth the virtual world , which is that the people who needed to be <unk> in the <unk> times , because they didn &apos;t need it yet .
they didn &apos;t have books .
or they didn &apos;t have any <unk> .
they didn &apos;t have natural government .
the only thing we had was her head .
and in this head , i was sitting in the head of the head .
in this head , you &apos;ve been <unk> , and through this virtual images , the imagination had been taken out .
and so it &apos;s also so strong in us that we can be able to be able to do so well .
so the interesting thing about that , if i could do a little video .
yeah , this is what &apos;s going on .
and the interesting thing about this is that the time of the human time , the people of the same time and the medium itself was .
now , if you look at a piece of time .
what are the media today ?
then you &apos;ll notice that there &apos;s a change .
but i &apos;m going to talk about it again .
a lot of a tool of the <unk> have been done for stories .
<unk> , a <unk> , called <unk> , who were the <unk> , to get knowledge in stories , to get knowledge in stories .
and yet , we &apos;ve got very , very much , very strong about stories .
the author of the book of the <unk> <unk> , jonathan <unk> , <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re still <unk> a year ago with the <unk> of stories .
that means for a kid that means to be able to get out of the <unk> that the most of his life has spent the most important time of his life .
now we think of our love to stories about that we &apos;ve played as a child on the car of our parents .
no , no , no .
this is a lot further back , in the cultures of <unk> times .
for me , in the area of a interactive media , as especially fascinating is that we have <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think of <unk> in our biological memory , the ability to think .
i &apos;ve got to give you a example of the british tribe of <unk> .
and the life lived in the <unk> of british columbia .
and as you can see , this is a very <unk> area , and you had to be able to move out there , from the island to the island to get food .
and that &apos;s what we did with this is called <unk> .
now , you might think that if you &apos;re interested in a little bit , from the australian world .
they have similar principles .
they don &apos;t have <unk> , but they &apos;re using the <unk> <unk> , or also <unk> .
and what the interesting thing about this is that the <unk> and the <unk> of regions could be made about songs .
where the language of the language <unk> was <unk> .
that means , you know , <unk> about sounds and about rhythm .
and these sounds , and this rhythm , and this rhythm , the <unk> of a region , and that , of course , allows you that you could <unk> these songs and invest different , and so on the left , they could move back to the bottom , and they were able to move back to the <unk> .
now , why don &apos;t we say more , to come from the top of a <unk> ?
anyway , not to navigate .
what &apos;s happened there ?
so this is how this is so <unk> .
we &apos;ve been able to move out in the way that we &apos;re doing .
this is what happened and happened is the book , and this is what happens is the <unk> .
and that &apos;s exactly what happens is that we have the responsibility for our memories and that the own production of our individual memories has been able to be able to make our individual fuels .
at the book , and on the image .
so let &apos;s have a little bit of god a little bit more <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s suddenly <unk> for us , and we &apos;ve got to do anything else to do with the reality of nothing .
brown brown , a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , is so far to say that this is that these processes , and he says the book , the internet , and so forth , the internet , and so on what we &apos;re going to call is that these processes , the internet of our memories , and our ability to <unk> our ability to <unk> .
let &apos;s take a little <unk> .
on the <unk> , for the machine .
what do we think of our thinking about our thinking and on our <unk> ?
then it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> of <unk> cultures .
and they &apos;re going to be in the course of centuries more and more <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> .
that means that instead of thinking about learning how to convince us , far <unk> , in the brain , are unique patterns of memories that we can see our personal memories .
we don &apos;t produce more themselves .
we have an abstract language .
we don &apos;t imagine the thing that the things don &apos;t exist in pictures of things , but we <unk> them our language .
we &apos;ve been used to be used to be able to happen that things happen .
and we &apos;ve got the assumption as law , and there are only exceptions , like , for example , <unk> .
what we &apos;ve done is the <unk> .
in fact , we &apos;re going to be <unk> as a <unk> , very strong , very strong .
the question is , what &apos;s going on ?
we had the <unk> <unk> , we had had this machine , and we &apos;re going to take this , and we &apos;re going to follow this .
it sounds very <unk> , and it sounds very , very much at mathematics , i know .
but these concepts of <unk> , the way that we get to discover these kinds of possibilities back back to our skills .
it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> , it &apos;s about <unk> .
i want to explain a little bit about a little bit .
so there are technological concepts like , for example , the <unk> reality , which is the <unk> reality .
so , if you look at google <unk> , then it &apos;s such a concept of what the virtual world is going to combine to do with the real world , which is called our <unk> to <unk> the virtual world as a little normal to feel natural .
another example is the so-called virtual reality .
so crazy , of course , in the context of my talk , we &apos;re going to move down to <unk> , virtual worlds , <unk> worlds , just after the <unk> of the <unk> .
and other one of the other example are the <unk> , smart systems .
these are rooms who can react to a human being .
all of this needs the ability to accept our basic ability to accept <unk> as a real habitat .
i &apos;m talking about this , and i hope to do this video , a very , very beautiful project , which is the <unk> of michael <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and those two <unk> are still here today .
maybe you can go back to a minute , so you can put it in the meeting with the two of the project .
and this project i &apos;ve brought up as an example , as an example of how back to this <unk> , cognitive models .
the whole thing is a game , i have to tell you .
so , of course , the <unk> of course , and it &apos;s a computer computer .
and if i tell the computer computer , you &apos;ve got very likely to hear that any of people have been <unk> , or that you &apos;re going to play with a lot of <unk> in the hand , or you &apos;re going to play with this with a little <unk> in the hand .
at every case they &apos;re doing this .
this is a game .
and this is what i thought that i think the world is the world , so that i think the real world is going back to the real world .
and this game is building the virtual world , so the data of the <unk> that we produce , with the real world .
i &apos;m sorry that i have to be <unk> so much .
you can explain the same way to explain a lot better , there &apos;s a lot more than that .
and that &apos;s what i think is that i have a city , because i look at what places are positive or <unk> .
and so i mean , i &apos;m going to see a whole other thing , which is a very different impression , which is i see negative and positive <unk> in a city , and so on this way , there &apos;s a very different , virtual map of a very real city of a very real city .
and that &apos;s what we can now like to look at .
ah , what you can see here is , sorry , is a little explanation of what you see right now .
of course , this virtual world in the walls of our cities , yes , is clear .
and with a kind of <unk> , we can make this virtual worlds visible .
so , i &apos;d like to end up with my talk , and that &apos;s in the sense that the properties and the skills that we &apos;ve got from the <unk> <unk> , and the skills that we &apos;ve taken out of that kind of <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been able to do with this kind of things that are called <unk> <unk> , but in fact , we &apos;re going to come back to our roots .
thank you .
yeah , i &apos;m very pleased to be able to be able to be able to be in front of you .
i &apos;ve been told if this <unk> is a <unk> bag , and i &apos;m going to talk about it , and i &apos;m going to talk about it .
it &apos;s not going to do it .
and i &apos;m going to go to the same time , which is there .
but i &apos;m going to do it just a little bit more curious .
yes , kids are from nature of stories or should be curious , designers also .
i &apos;m <unk> by the house , so , of course , i &apos;m also interested in the theme of curiosity and how it changes the curiosity , and why don &apos;t we lose curiosity , and we need to do it again , and so forth .
this is a whole series of things that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do .
if the professors are curious , they will often be <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
and this is also what i had in the last half of a year .
a <unk> to the theme of the most important model of design design .
now , you &apos;re going to ask , why are all the <unk> that are so natural , <unk> <unk> of communication , interaction and so forth .
and there &apos;s only one of these little devices , because the things are going to be more efficient , because the things are going to be more effective , it &apos;s always more important , and there is to look at what &apos;s really important for us , of course , which is <unk> or intuitive .
and in the background of the background , i &apos;ve been able to be in the area of <unk> design , so the next generation of human computers in the relationship in the relationship of the human computer , like our tools , or how to change the computer from the way that we &apos;re changing in the digital <unk> .
so i &apos;ve been working with that , of course , because of course , of course .
maybe you might get a look at it again .
why does that happen ?
so , if we look at the development of our society , here &apos;s just a minute , and then we &apos;re going to move forward from the third <unk> or <unk> .
so from modern <unk> .
every society is <unk> by a <unk> .
at the beginning of the time , the <unk> of the language .
that means you &apos;ve found a common language that you could talk to each other , you could communicate in the same cave , in the same cave , or in other areas , cities have been able to create cities or villages , and we have a <unk> <unk> .
but the <unk> was , but the language , something very natural , something very important .
it &apos;s also about learning , so you can &apos;t learn , so i can &apos;t deal with nature of nature , but we learn it , and of course , we learn .
and then that was , by the ancient society , and the first form of abstraction .
this was a <unk> , because of course , of course , we began to <unk> the <unk> language , which means what <unk> and alive is going to go back and <unk> it in rock , and so i <unk> it in stone , and so i <unk> it .
after the time , as i <unk> , and when i <unk> , it &apos;s a very different story than if there &apos;s a life , as if there &apos;s a life like that .
but then <unk> , it was taken out of this <unk> as a <unk> , was published .
then the next generation came out in which we &apos;re actually interested in most of life today .
this is the way through pressure and <unk> <unk> , with <unk> and other .
at the same time , it was the same <unk> , where the <unk> , <unk> and other said , are you really <unk> when the people start to read , then they want to go back to the time , and it &apos;s totally <unk> .
and now we &apos;re going to come to the next generation and the exciting thing is that an <unk> is only a few hundred years , and we &apos;re actually in the moment in this <unk> phase phase that we &apos;re doing something like this .
and of course , it &apos;s totally <unk> because we see on one side of the new media , <unk> social media , facebook and so forth .
now , in the great transparency , what the new thinking is , what the new thinking is , you don &apos;t tell you that in the <unk> <unk> , and no blood is more , or other phenomena , i want to think about it , and i want to do that .
and these two worlds , all of these worlds , new and old thinking .
the exciting thing is , if you look at the bottom , these new society , these <unk> , <unk> , is very different mechanisms , principles and <unk> paradigm from the <unk> .
now , you don &apos;t have more on the local level , but on global level .
we understood that the weather is global .
that &apos;s the theme ecology is a global .
not , if i think about it , and the neighbor is less , and the neighbor thinks less , it doesn &apos;t work anymore .
this means , from the local village , is actually a global village with the same principles , of course , the same thing , of course , but also the original transparency .
so as you knew in the village , who was what &apos;s in the village , and when this is what happened today , that &apos;s what happens to us about this <unk> <unk> on global level .
it &apos;s that we know that we know global , and faster and faster .
that &apos;s how it happened to the village on the village .
now , in the background of the background , i &apos;ve been trying to look at what &apos;s called it , which is what we might do for us , of course , what we might do for us , but what does the difference is , so what does the difference ?
because often , people have people , you can &apos;t do it <unk> , so everybody can do with it .
so you &apos;ve got to do with this , which means that , and not only just change it is that it &apos;s different , but it &apos;s going to be better .
and , of course , , of course , some of the things , and how can i take it as a <unk> , and you can take the things like that , you know , it &apos;s a <unk> , so they &apos;re the same thing , because then they &apos;re fun and they &apos;re going to use it .
you go back , even during the <unk> , with the theme of perception and the <unk> .
and of course , it &apos;s also what you start , and look at the bottom and says , okay , i just look at the internal self .
and how does it look like this , right ?
so how do we work when we <unk> ?
and what does that mean because of course , and how do we work our movements of perception and how does the cognitive connection of perception ?
because steve jobs has said , you know , <unk> to <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
so you really have to look at the details if i want to do something <unk> or intuitive <unk> , which is what &apos;s called in the core .
and there you see one of our seven senses , most of the things that we &apos;re thinking about five , now , there is already seven , there &apos;s already seven , because i &apos;m going to be in the <unk> future of the next , the next thing , and as a force , and then in our self .
and to look at how do we process information , how do we take information ?
to say , what is information ?
information is every difference that &apos;s a difference .
now , we &apos;re going to use the word , but i don &apos;t know what it means to do .
but i have to understand in the core of knowledge , when it &apos;s about information , when it &apos;s about data information and from information , i know , i know how to do things , and of course , i can do things as well as well .
and of course , how does design influence influence on perception .
we see this , if i &apos;m doing things , i can make them <unk> like on the right side , where i don &apos;t know what is salt and memory , or i can make them so , and i can make them so closely by the things that i &apos;m going to show things about .
so a lot of natural natural , in a <unk> , but i look at it right now , where is salt and memory in it .
and if i tell somebody , please give me salt or sound , then he &apos;s going to look at the right thing , where is what it is .
and in the left of the left , and i hope , i hope , i hope that there is no sugar in the way that the salt is going to be <unk> .
but also our perception itself , how <unk> it is .
for example , this perception in context .
the right circle looks bigger than the small one , although it &apos;s not the case , but they &apos;re on the same size , but they &apos;re in the same amount of big , and yet our perception , depending on what we &apos;re doing things .
anybody know what that is ?
<unk> on it .
<unk> <unk> was supposed to work .
there &apos;s a little bit of my glasses .
so it &apos;s the n circle .
the second circle begins to be able to make certain clarity or <unk> .
and then , if i &apos;m going to end up , i &apos;m going to see you &apos;re not just an asteroid , which is the circle , the circle , circle and , but we see a unit , we don &apos;t see three parts , a circle , a circle , a circle , another .
this is what you call <unk> or <unk> , which is also changing us in perception .
so , for the <unk> , that &apos;s probably the most of the <unk> , the most famous <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> of the continuity and so forth .
we &apos;ve forgotten around the third of the same time .
but this is a very important part , if you &apos;re able to make things like this to be able to make things as well as well .
the next phenomenon , which is also very interesting , which is very interesting about that .
it turns out the <unk> , but it &apos;s very exciting , if you go closer to this , if you go closer .
so we &apos;ve got the eyes , and now you think we &apos;re looking at the end of the end .
that &apos;s wrong .
and you look at the bottom of the back .
but it &apos;s <unk> to the end that you see something that you see something that you see , <unk> circle .
this means we only see our <unk> before we see it , and then we see it back to the back to the back in our <unk> , to say , okay , okay .
so , i &apos;ve got a lot of cognitive <unk> , you know what you want to see .
so this is also there , and then it comes back .
and then it goes back to the end , because the back on the back of the end is not , and he says , well , i &apos;m going to look at it again , and i &apos;m sure , if you look at what you see , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to see , that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to see .
and then it goes back to the back , and then it &apos;s actually just seen .
so , in fact , the <unk> process , like certain things , and in what &apos;s going to happen to <unk> these things .
i don &apos;t know who tell you this picture .
this is exactly the same thing that i &apos;ve been described .
now everybody &apos;s trying to see something from this pattern .
i don &apos;t know who you see .
anybody else else ?
a <unk> , right .
if i saw that this is that there &apos;s a <unk> inside , then you know this .
they &apos;re never forgotten , because i &apos;m going to show you where the <unk> is .
now you see the <unk> .
and it goes , now , you &apos;re all going to see him .
this is what i mean , in fact , it &apos;s actually <unk> that they don &apos;t realize that they don &apos;t realize that they don &apos;t see patterns , but i have <unk> in a second time to see this dog in this <unk> image .
and this is the projection of the <unk> , <unk> , see .
now i know , and i &apos;m going to go back to the end of that i see the <unk> .
i see the <unk> .
so , very exciting processes that , in this case , in this , yes , of course , it &apos;s not actually not , but here , in this <unk> crowd , is going to be able to do this .
anybody know what three seconds are ?
long , yeah .
that &apos;s our present .
so , it &apos;s always interesting to know as designers .
if i know , there &apos;s three seconds , until i think about the present in the <unk> , and then i can also be able to make a very good <unk> , in which i &apos;m going to get him through three seconds .
that &apos;s what it has to do as the present .
and then it goes into the past , and so i can do very <unk> <unk> for example in the computer , when i know this phenomenon .
what does <unk> milliseconds ?
yes , cheap .
it &apos;s a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time you &apos;re in love with love .
and that means , you know , if you know that you know what you &apos;re going to look like for a long time , because i don &apos;t know , because i don &apos;t have the <unk> for what it is going to happen to happen .
and <unk> milliseconds , also a very exciting phenomenon .
that &apos;s the time of most of the perceptions that we have .
that means that the first impression happens in a very useful pace of how we see things .
and as we see things also , what we &apos;re looking at , and how we &apos;re going to get to our environment , that we can think about the way that we can think about it .
of course , it &apos;s not only about the subject of perceptions and neural <unk> or <unk> or <unk> , but , of course , with the theme of <unk> .
so , as a human way , a human thing is about this .
so there &apos;s the practical functions , which is so <unk> things , so <unk> things , or <unk> things .
there are <unk> , where i know exactly , where i don &apos;t have to do .
but there &apos;s also symbolic functions , why is someone like this is a little <unk> , where no one of the <unk> , so <unk> <unk> to money , even though it &apos;s not so rare ?
there we are more <unk> , on the <unk> , on the <unk> , which we have , of course , is , of course .
back to my real theme of natural <unk> interface and the theme , of course , <unk> , is <unk> .
<unk> means always that , as i can do a lot easier , or how can i get a use in a certain sense , or how can make a users in a certain <unk> , efficient and <unk> of a goal .
that &apos;s how it says , it &apos;s more likely to be the norm .
how can i do something like that ?
can i do that right , or we need to have the n <unk> , or we need to be a <unk> training .
and less <unk> or <unk> is it .
i think that i &apos;m just going to do something differently and beautiful , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s better .
you need to understand .
and if you look at the software that we &apos;ve seen , you &apos;re going to see , you &apos;re going to be able to understand why <unk> percent of our today &apos;s software , or not the <unk> , the <unk> in many areas or <unk> , although it &apos;s a lot more effective than classical software .
this is intuitive <unk> not only since apple <unk> , <unk> <unk> , if i want to make technological devices , if i want to make technological devices the people .
why ?
because in the rule we think about this new kind of <unk> , which is the natural level of <unk> , for example five faster faster in the average of our goal .
they have to imagine that they &apos;re going to be , if you &apos;re doing something of classical <unk> , five hours , and with this new way of natural software is just a hour .
it doesn &apos;t mean that they &apos;re probably going to get four hours to go home , but your <unk> or someone else is going to be able to go back to the four hours .
but i want to say that it &apos;s an <unk> , of course , to make certain things .
so , when we go back to the area of the software , this is the first <unk> line that was very abstract , which was very abstract where you needed months to deal with these systems .
and then the next one , the next thing that i &apos;ve been in here with a <unk> model or mental model like the software <unk> , which is what you would have was an idea of something that &apos;s metaphor , the metaphor of a enemy to make the computers .
so it &apos;s not more <unk> and zeros or <unk> code , but a metaphor .
this is what we &apos;ve done all sorts of <unk> , but it &apos;s also a lot better than that , of course , too much better .
the next generation of <unk> <unk> has been working very much more with behavior .
so , i &apos;m making a lot more than the behavior that look like this .
this is also such a paradigm .
i &apos;m going to look at that that &apos;s always <unk> for the success , just the <unk> .
and if i put a step back into this <unk> <unk> , where i share with voice , by language , by a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and not more by mouse , and they have to control the things , then i &apos;m still getting faster .
but this is also the point to the point , when are the things that are doing , because of course , things like that ?
if you get deeper , and then i have to go back to my little friend here , and look at my little friend , where is that , what &apos;s going to be out of the <unk> , when &apos;s really something like this , right ?
and this is for us people are always doing something like that , if i have to think about it , i &apos;ve got to think about it .
so he doesn &apos;t want to think about it , but it &apos;s easy to do it .
the less i think about that , the more is it .
and what does that mean for the designers ?
and that means if we look at the world , we can create the world <unk> from one on something else , for example , the metaphor , i can do this as a <unk> .
that means that i can be able to make an intuitive , human <unk> on a software , and so that the software of the software is going to be able to make the software <unk> .
so , of course , the question is , what &apos;s actually like this is the <unk> <unk> of us , and now i &apos;ve heard about it .
this is called <unk> .
all of us are using us and <unk> is a <unk> , and it &apos;s like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s all of you all the time , but it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s also intuitive , and it &apos;s also intuitive .
so the model is going to be <unk> in the neocortex , and it &apos;s <unk> , so it &apos;s working on the world of young and old , and it &apos;s going to be used all the time , without most of us knew that this model is there .
<unk> <unk> is going to be about 50 to <unk> times from us , so , in your sleep , you &apos;ve found that it &apos;s going to be less often <unk> than a day .
now , i can see this mental <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> on a <unk> .
and through that kind of <unk> , like with the metaphor of the <unk> , but it &apos;s not a metaphor of an physical object , but a metaphor of a <unk> , a <unk> .
and this is on a higher inventor of <unk> as this is the <unk> of a classic metaphor , which is the <unk> of the <unk> .
and if i think this is <unk> , for example , in which i don &apos;t look like <unk> <unk> , <unk> as a choice , i can look at me in the details , and yes , <unk> means , i can see it in front of you or somebody else , or <unk> , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth .
and then i can <unk> the whole thing .
i &apos;m trying to do this for a <unk> .
now , everybody has been eaten .
im : now , i &apos;m going to work with the object , you can <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
i &apos;m going to be able to get all of this , and you can tell you , i &apos;m going to show you all the thing with chocolate , for example .
and we &apos;ve got a interface , which is much more effective and very much natural natural .
because that i can get the things like the piece of the game , and they &apos;re going to come to me is much natural natural than if you can get <unk> <unk> and other mechanisms , or other mechanisms to make these things .
what i want to do is to give up is more <unk> <unk> , and with this sentence , i want to try to look at one , a and a few times , designers have to think differently to come to new solutions , and in this sense , i thank you very much for your attention to your attention and please .
i want to give you a very specific aspect of curiosity .
the first one , if you become a child as a child , as a baby , is that they &apos;re going to be able to do what <unk> you would have , yes ? and depending on if your parents allows them to play more or less in the <unk> , the more , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , of course .
and the curiosity can &apos;t learn .
that &apos;s all the ones that are here and stories are , in fact , people who have a property that you can &apos;t learn .
now , i &apos;m going to do this , especially this whole <unk> , <unk> , 40 years of <unk> , in the quality of the way .
and there &apos;s a central point .
and that depends on phosphorus .
<unk> <unk> a chance .
every day you &apos;re going to give you the size of about two billion phosphorus models , and every day you have to take two billion phosphorus phosphorus .
you can &apos;t have teeth .
you can &apos;t buy energy .
you can &apos;t have bones .
we could only have <unk> <unk> through the <unk> .
if we didn &apos;t take phosphorus and make phosphorus .
in fact , it &apos;s so that we &apos;re doing here with something that &apos;s actually , in fact , in fact , which is actually not that way , but it &apos;s not that way .
because all of the talk about energy , but no one talk about the <unk> .
the <unk> is much important .
we &apos;re sitting from two countries .
we only have to do with two years , and now it &apos;s now going to be <unk> by the <unk> world in the world , as a lot more <unk> in the environment that will be used in all the <unk> .
and in the last 20 years , <unk> tons are <unk> tons of <unk> to our fields in germany .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
it &apos;s making kabul in children .
and we think we would protect the environment if we &apos;re a little less transparent .
so , for example , <unk> the environment , gets less less car .
<unk> the environment , will be less garbage .
<unk> the environment , <unk> less energy .
but that &apos;s not an protection .
this is how if i &apos;d say , <unk> your child , it &apos;s just three times more than five times .
that &apos;s just a little less destruction .
if we think about the <unk> of the <unk> , we &apos;re going to be able to think our entire earth would be before or later a <unk> .
that &apos;s how to think about the <unk> to think of <unk> .
and the most important thing about that is to look at the ground as well .
the bottom is about 60 percent of the <unk> .
in the moment , we &apos;re building corn and lose between 11 and dozens of 500 tons per billion dollars per billion , or on the <unk> .
that means we &apos;re going to lose in the bottom of a long time more than a new time .
we can see , of course , to look at the <unk> .
and all of this is <unk> or content .
in <unk> , for example , is the <unk> twenty percent of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and because we &apos;re going to be older , it &apos;s going to be bigger .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re all in the <unk> .
yes ?
a baby takes about six euros .
we could reduce that of course about 10 percent , but what does that mean ?
this is <unk> in china in a second .
that &apos;s completely <unk> .
so , the question is , how do we go to this <unk> ?
this is one of the evidence that men are not pigs .
let me tell you .
because the phosphorus is going to be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> .
the people about the <unk> .
yeah .
so , they can &apos;t be pigs to be pigs .
because that &apos;s why it &apos;s <unk> , right ?
in fact , we think in <unk> , we &apos;re too much on the world .
and if you think of the people , if you &apos;re going to exist the people , if you say , that would be better , you wouldn &apos;t be there , you &apos;re not going to be there .
and so someone tells someone al gore , one of our big heroes , there &apos;s nothing <unk> than the human population .
in israel , you &apos;re going to say , if you <unk> a life , you <unk> the earth .
this is what it says is that the more you <unk> , the better .
yeah .
the first question is , we &apos;re really too much too much ?
if you look at the ants , the weight of the ants on earth , then the ants are about four times more than we humans .
i could be able to use <unk> , but in the united states , there may be no <unk> , in the same time , even though they &apos;re <unk> .
that means , the ants would be much more than we are .
and because they work very much harder to work as we and because they only have three to six months , they &apos;re going to be in their weight , in their weight , in the energy consumption , a <unk> billion people .
that means we &apos;re not too many , we &apos;re too unhappy , yes ?
and where you &apos;re looking at how far we really wanted to do , and we could see , and how sad we are that we &apos;re at all on the earth , you can see that , for example , <unk> a program , until twenty 24 , you &apos;re going to be <unk> here , right ?
you can only be <unk> , if you don &apos;t exist , yes ?
the only chance .
have you seen a <unk> tree ?
yes ?
one thing ?
that means our entire intelligence means that we want to be <unk> as the trees , yes ?
yes ?
no tree is <unk> .
fortunately not , yes ?
there is no <unk> of trees .
there are still six billion trees in the <unk> <unk> .
you &apos;ve heard a little bit about <unk> from trees ?
that means all our intelligence means that we want to be <unk> as trees .
and where you see , even in something like <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is <unk> , it doesn &apos;t allow us to go back to their own <unk> .
every year , we &apos;re going to lose three million tons of phosphorus that really had to go back .
and so we &apos;re too much .
it &apos;s about it .
that means we feel so guilty on earth that we say . there &apos;s no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> , and as you &apos;re all going to say that our own <unk> is going to go back .
isn &apos;t that sad ?
so we &apos;re too much .
it &apos;s safe to be less difficult to be less effective , which is <unk> .
but where are we useful ?
we &apos;re trying to explore our ecological footprint , but it &apos;s about to have a big footprint that &apos;s useful .
we want to be good for society , we want to be good for the economy , but if it &apos;s about the environment , is the highest , right ?
<unk> , yes ?
you can only have <unk> , if you &apos;re not there .
even if you were waiting now , they would be protected emissions .
so you can &apos;t solve that .
we can see it differently .
we can put our nutrients down .
we &apos;re doing in brazil agriculture in which we get the nutrients .
in the right thing , we can use the way nutrients in agriculture .
we &apos;re doing that in china , for example , where we &apos;re going to take right now .
in china , one of the <unk> today , is that there &apos;s still <unk> , sort of , right ?
and in our western world , we were always too stupid , our nutrients , our nutrients .
this means that the entire western <unk> <unk> is that the city was always taken , but the farmers never had a <unk> .
so the cities had to grow more and more , because the farmers were going to go to cities , and the cities had to keep their nutrients to get their nutrients .
all of the western wealthy are always <unk> , until they don &apos;t have the infrastructure to get more , and then they &apos;re <unk> .
yes ?
in china , it was different .
you &apos;ve been able to get <unk> civilization over a million years , because you &apos;re always able to be able to <unk> nutrients .
even today , if you invited to eat the food in china , you would expect to eat their food as long as you &apos;re going to get the toilet .
because it &apos;s <unk> , to go and get the nutrients .
you &apos;ve got them invited to eat her food , not the <unk> .
that means you can see in the internet , as you can get the nutrients .
so , the fact is , if you do that , agriculture is going to be <unk> , in a meter of land with millions of land with millions of dollars , and you can wait to be a farmer of <unk> dollars , and you &apos;re going to grow up , chickens and <unk> and fish and fish and fish .
and the great thing about this is that the <unk> <unk> in the favelas are about 160 percent .
so we don &apos;t have to control the people to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
this is <unk> , of course , but the flowers are going to get themselves .
the <unk> is clean water .
and they &apos;re so designed by the design of design , which is a farmer that &apos;s easy to be able to go .
that means to go back to the <unk> .
and no one of these <unk> , we &apos;ve done now about <unk> built in the last 20 years , no one of these whales had ever been <unk> .
it could just be so easy to get a <unk> <unk> , and then the facility would be <unk> about years .
don &apos;t be more than that .
that means we don &apos;t have to control the people to be bad .
we can support them to be good .
that means we need to <unk> phosphorus .
and by the way , if you want to do that , you write out in germany , in germany , in germany , in germany , in fact , <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not in <unk> , but maybe you can make a little bit a little bit about it .
because the <unk> is going to be able to be able to put phosphorus in the best direction .
and that &apos;s got to go back .
we see that phosphorus is really critical .
and we see that it does .
we &apos;ve been used for three years now .
the <unk> government explains , they &apos;re going to be the first country in the world , which is making phosphorus <unk> .
but we need the <unk> .
you know , there are two countries that control is almost 70 percent of the <unk> in the world .
there &apos;s a bunch of <unk> a bunch of <unk> .
these are <unk> countries who control 40 percent of the <unk> .
and the oil is going to replace we can replace .
but the phosphorus will not be able to replace .
so it &apos;s not about to make the <unk> a little bit less bad , but it &apos;s about to do something right .
and i think , of course , to ask questions what the right thing is .
that means it &apos;s about efficiency , not to efficiency .
in cairo , you don &apos;t understand that , because in scotland , the country is able to grow the country on flowers .
yes ?
imagine if your wife is sad , if they have <unk> them , and they come out with 50 <unk> .
it &apos;s cheaper .
but it &apos;s really effective , right ?
or take a <unk> .
a woman in germany is about six <unk> three kilograms of their lives .
it &apos;s .
that &apos;s not true in 1950 , because we don &apos;t know , because because we don &apos;t know how much <unk> is going to be .
but a <unk> , even in this water , i can tell you , is completely inefficient , but very effective , right ?
one of all in life is beautiful , it &apos;s not efficient .
so that doesn &apos;t matter , but efficiency .
ask , what &apos;s the right ?
not to be able to burn a little bit better , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and that <unk> and in the <unk> , the whole materials for <unk> , but first to ask questions how do you create ?
think about horses efficient .
yes ?
when i go to dinner , and i say , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> with <unk> and a glass of water .
so , i mean , &quot; well ?
this is efficient .
all of what life is beautiful , is not efficient .
if you &apos;re in love with somebody , efficient ?
yes ?
that means everything that counts in life is not to avoid to avoid to control .
the whole <unk> .
we say the people , oh yeah , you don &apos;t have a mirror in the south .
no , it &apos;s just the right , right ?
in every place , where you &apos;re <unk> , you &apos;re going to go back to <unk> .
but the wrong thing .
if you <unk> the wrong things , you &apos;ve got a <unk> .
in how we think of north .
there &apos;s all the footprint .
if you walk , yes , every footprint was the ground .
because the bottom is going to die , and the wind is going to die , and the water comes from the ground , and the water comes out of the ground .
but if you &apos;re in italy , every way in italy , every way that the water is going to be in the conflict .
so , it &apos;s about to create a big footprint that will be a <unk> .
not <unk> .
we say in germany , in germany .
yes ?
but if i ask them , how about your wife ?
what do you tell ?
sustainable .
then i say , <unk> <unk> , yes ?
that &apos;s just the minimum .
so not save , it doesn &apos;t avoid .
every waste is <unk> .
and it turns out , if you see in italy in italy , like the people in the high regime , like the people in the high regime , it &apos;s like that .
because you know , this is a <unk> process .
it &apos;s a big form of <unk> , yes ?
you can show , i was there .
but with the right design , please .
for example , we &apos;ve developed a <unk> , which is in the middle room , which is in the room .
you can <unk> where they &apos;re going to go and stand .
in two hours , they &apos;re building all over two hours .
and they &apos;re using seeds of rare plants so that they &apos;re going through the <unk> to biodiversity .
that means we &apos;re useful , not less glamorous .
so there are two <unk> .
not anything to be <unk> .
a tv , or a washing machine , they &apos;re not only using it , they don &apos;t use them .
it &apos;s the things that <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , like <unk> , who needs to be so that they &apos;re going to go into biological systems .
the things that are only used to be used in technological systems .
but today we &apos;re talking about the biological systems .
yes ?
for example , the <unk> , yes ?
it &apos;s not a direct ad , and it doesn &apos;t matter for the company <unk> , but that &apos;s why they &apos;re going to help that this company to make these products successful .
because we don &apos;t do that , we don &apos;t make things more free .
yes ?
so , if i go to your food and say , this is free by <unk> , then it doesn &apos;t help them .
no , we <unk> , which is inside .
good .
so , not like <unk> .
not oxygen in the way .
but all of what it is about is useful .
these are the first shoes that you can do with the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> , and you can go to <unk> , right ?
all of this is <unk> .
and if there are us , we &apos;re doing it , of course , <unk> , for phosphorus , for <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the entire systems .
and that &apos;s half of all the <unk> in the world that are produced by the systems .
so that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do with you , ask people to ask people .
hey , <unk> , is it really serious ?
because that &apos;s already twice the <unk> .
and i &apos;m not just so sure if you really <unk> .
so , let me give you a little bit .
but it &apos;s about it .
yeah .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
that &apos;s going on .
we can do things like that , you can see , if you <unk> , if you <unk> , you can do it in biological <unk> .
technology is the same thing that &apos;s the same thing .
so there &apos;s a look at this one of the <unk> .
this is the first ecological mountains , in fact , which is made for that , in the <unk> .
but this is , in every store , you can <unk> things .
if you come to that , yes ?
do you remember the <unk> time ?
if the moment is the garbage .
all of these <unk> , it &apos;s almost about it , pretty much .
in the countries where people come to money .
this is on the <unk> , but still in the landscape , right ?
if we change the plastic , so that it can go into biological systems , if we &apos;re changing the <unk> , you can go back to <unk> , you can go back with a baby in israel or in tunisia <unk> trees .
yes ?
because if you take this <unk> , they take <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and the powder , to the plants to grow the trees .
this is the baby <unk> for the entire life , especially from beginning .
so we don &apos;t need to be <unk> , we can be <unk> .
it &apos;s about a <unk> <unk> <unk> .
yeah , so , you know .
yes ?
we can do it .
we can also invent all the time .
i created a institute .
now , in the same time , there are a lot of people working with , and they can all see .
so there &apos;s a conversation that is <unk> , where everybody can come up .
so it doesn &apos;t save more , it doesn &apos;t control , it &apos;s not <unk> , but intelligent waste , but intelligent waste .
do you feel that curious ?
thank you .
the work of <unk> .
music as language .
in the description of my speech , i wrote that i wrote as a <unk> , i think , as a <unk> , i understand the english <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> notes in <unk> music .
it &apos;s not just the word for the word for the word for the word to the text in a different language , but also to understand the deeper sense of the words and <unk> to understand that there is a serious translation , everybody who has to do with <unk> .
to translate out of the poet in english , there can be more knowledge , because it &apos;s when you put it to love to love , or you &apos;re talking about poetry , or it &apos;s about poetry .
it &apos;s <unk> , but for <unk> , what we call musicians with our <unk> .
as a <unk> of a <unk> , i only have the <unk> notes .
you &apos;re sure that the yemen in the notes was exactly all the <unk> , which he has found it .
in fact , the notes are very rich and <unk> .
these notes are about the same right , or <unk> , like a <unk> , if it &apos;s very impossible <unk> , <unk> a landscape .
because in this <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of flowers is not to smell , the degree of <unk> is just to be able to be able to hear the <unk> of the <unk> , not to be able to hear .
this means , the <unk> needs to get this <unk> <unk> in a different , which is <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you what i &apos;d like to do . so , <unk> , even in a <unk> language .
so , in fact , a translation of translation .
that &apos;s why i &apos;d like to do it on german , because if i had to translate it even in english , it would be for me to translate the translation of the translation of translation .
so the other thing that music works for me is so similar to me as the spoken language .
the <unk> notes are the function of the letters of the letters .
so , it &apos;s not going to learn to learn to read the notes , and that looks at the piano on the piano , or the right place on a <unk> .
that &apos;s just the letters that you learned to paint .
the sense of the letters , you know , if you can &apos;t do the language .
and so you need to use the <unk> of music in least as long as long as the spoken language for spoken language .
then there &apos;s also <unk> , whether you learn it for the <unk> , only passive understanding , or you can also talk affordable to the musical students .
so the work of <unk> starts to be like the <unk> of a <unk> .
so after first , you &apos;ve got a piece to play , because you &apos;re excited about it , you &apos;re going to end up , you &apos;re looking at the <unk> of the composition of the composition of the composition .
you &apos;re <unk> information about the piece of <unk> .
you read in the letters of the letters , <unk> , notes , or whether there &apos;s words , thinking of the composer itself .
you &apos;ve been talking about the work that he had before and after the time .
and you &apos;re looking at <unk> .
the <unk> , to write it .
how and what did he do ?
how were their borders , how the society of society and politics ?
that &apos;s all about me .
you think about that time in this time , you &apos;re going to look at russia , and you read literature .
now , in the time , you &apos;ve got an rich knowledge of the composer that you &apos;re going to be different to be different , and it &apos;s always easier to feel <unk> in it , and it &apos;s always easier to feel in it .
the composer is always going to be more to the friend that you live together .
it &apos;s about to write the piece of a little bit more and more and more and more to my personal awareness , to play it .
now , the notes of all other times as a straight book of the theme of the composer , but only a symbol , i &apos;m going to do this framework to get it back with sense and meaning .
i &apos;m going to say to my own words , which could be written between this asteroid .
i play <unk> , what these sounds might be .
now , for me , and for the composer , and what they might do for him ?
every tone , every word is going to be a sense , because i feel about it , because i think it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
it has to be <unk> for me in here , and i can &apos;t convince my audience to tell you that this is my opinion .
it &apos;s always a very unusual beach , if i could have the experience , the piece that i can have the experience , that i &apos;ve got so long to see how to experience .
as you &apos;ve always experienced a happy new day , even though you &apos;ve always experienced the same rituals of life , come up , <unk> , to work , so i &apos;m going to get the same piece to go back to the new .
i &apos;ve been born a day older , the equations , my phones on night as the morning , and in a <unk> , it takes more than the sound to go back to your home .
i suppose the <unk> of the audience is true , you know , <unk> .
all of this is changing me , and all of this is changing my experience with the composition .
it &apos;s also wonderful , when i stand with a <unk> on the stage , and we &apos;ve got the same projection .
and then the same thing happens in a good , <unk> conversation .
you make a new idea in it , and it &apos;s going to get this answers with a reaction .
it &apos;s exciting , because it happens things that we don &apos;t have <unk> , and what you can &apos;t do with it .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to make music to make music , and they &apos;ve seen the audience , like the music that &apos;s alive .
so every beach is another beach .
i &apos;m never going to play a little bit more like this moment in this moment .
i &apos;m not going to play this , like in 17 years .
and so i &apos;m going to have more <unk> than today , and therefore , i &apos;m going to go through my palette of <unk> a lot more <unk> , to emotions and emotions than today .
sure , i &apos;m going to have some <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s new <unk> .
i &apos;m a nice <unk> example of this .
it was on a <unk> for <unk> , in my hometown old teachers , professor <unk> <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> in the <unk> here .
unfortunately , i had a lot of too young , so he was going to be <unk> when i finally started to study .
but i had the great fortune , it was very early , with 13 years ago , and so i &apos;ve been in my school on my school .
i was 17 , when i was sitting on one of his students , and i was sitting on one of his students , and the last one of the four <unk> of <unk> , a <unk> .
he asked me what the introduction of this <unk> for me was .
this is such a <unk> part .
and in my <unk> , i said , i said .
and he said , and he said , so ?
this has to be <unk> .
because for me , you think about it .
he was already about 60 .
well , with 17 , you &apos;ve got to get dreams , but not important memories .
i &apos;m going to play the piece of all over a couple of years ago , and it &apos;s always done for me , even though no one was changed .
every time , it &apos;s exciting , because i read something new .
one example of a very different area of a very different area , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s always the same garden , but to different <unk> , <unk> light .
he was <unk> the <unk> <unk> , as he saw her , as they saw it in this moment .
his personal <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> interpretation of a piece of a piece of this .
now , i &apos;ve been able to get older than <unk> years ago , when he wrote the piece .
he was only <unk> years ago .
and it &apos;s important to look back to the notes , even when i mean , i mean , you can use it .
to think about <unk> , right with the composer .
because the notes are the only connection to him .
most importantly , if he was already died .
now , how do you start to talk the language of music ?
i said , you know , you need to be about as long as the spoken language for spoken language .
often , the <unk> is that you just learn to read the notes .
you &apos;re interested in the end of the time before you just talk about a word .
you learn to find the sounds to find the sound on the enemy .
if all of the fingers in time and exactly as the way it comes into the notes , they come out of sound , then the sound that looks like music as music as music .
if that happens , the students are going to get the <unk> piece .
it &apos;s not going to talk about interpretation in the <unk> .
so well , there &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is a beautiful piece .
<unk> , slowly .
and <unk> , <unk> and b , and b , etc .
now , most of you know here .
but also , if you use this data , it &apos;s still a little bit of design .
and there &apos;s still no interpretation .
i wonder .
i wonder that you often forget a little bit .
and that &apos;s that to make music on the instrument that are going to do their own musical musical and feel already before .
that &apos;s what they said .
a child who didn &apos;t learned that , because it doesn &apos;t have the parents , it &apos;s not going to be <unk> , it &apos;s not going to do it .
this is like <unk> .
it &apos;s necessary to get your own experience and to have the idea of music to have a different possibility , so about a instrument to get to sound .
people who never got <unk> , and they never have been able to make their own bodies , like it is to create a tone .
the dog with his own breath with his own breath .
it &apos;s the <unk> of our body , which is the force of our body .
our <unk> to sing , our hands and feet to dance .
this is the <unk> of my fingers in the piano of my fingers .
the melody comes out of the <unk> and the rhythm of the dance .
the <unk> <unk> today with music is not <unk> .
you don &apos;t need to make more yourself music if it &apos;s going to be a boring .
not enough to sing a <unk> , or to sing .
every whole music is going to be <unk> , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> from the outside of music with music .
sure , there &apos;s some of you who say , yes , but what do you do when i don &apos;t sing if i can &apos;t sing ?
i mean , you can &apos;t sing , a , because you don &apos;t think they can &apos;t sing ?
or b , because they didn &apos;t have learned to sing ?
in two , it &apos;s not too late to try to figure out whether you can &apos;t even learn whether you can &apos;t even learn , or learn how to make these little muscles that the <unk> , right .
this is what you can do .
or c , because you have <unk> them , they &apos;re <unk> .
so , i ask , how <unk> <unk> was this diagnosis ?
did you have a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , how do you say it &apos;s beautiful ?
or d , you don &apos;t like to stop music , and that &apos;s why it doesn &apos;t want to do that .
but what i &apos;d like to think about is that music is a beautiful , <unk> thing .
but maybe you can do it again .
so , you see , you can see all the cases , nobody has to be a <unk> .
but you don &apos;t say , i don &apos;t understand anything about classical music .
i can &apos;t tell whether it &apos;s good or bad .
there i said , but sure i can tell you whether it doesn &apos;t like it or not .
because i don &apos;t think it &apos;s saying , i don &apos;t know if i swear that i can &apos;t cook because i can &apos;t cook .
so , it doesn &apos;t be on food , only because they can &apos;t cook .
so you don &apos;t have to get to the classic music , because you don &apos;t have a instrument .
listen to yourself and tell you whether it doesn &apos;t hurt them or not .
whether the music is to <unk> or very cute .
tell what you feel .
and in the time , they &apos;re also <unk> , and you want to make something more <unk> there , or taste , even nice differences .
now , why do i talk about my audience now that it &apos;s also <unk> ?
because the music is a language , and a language is to communicate .
a piece of a piece that you &apos;re never looking at is not going to be a force .
the food that comes from a test or a chef called <unk> , has to be eaten , and not just looked at it or <unk> .
so you hear if a music is going to be played .
it &apos;s not just a nice <unk> .
if in a environment , where the adults can make the adults make music , or at least active music , a child , it &apos;s just easy for a <unk> , to ask questions , which is the color has your flower ?
can you look at me in blue ?
and the child plays , after a <unk> <unk> , instead of a red flower now , is a blue flower .
and this sounds different than before .
so that was the first beginning of a own musical expression .
so the first step on a interpretation .
and what happens when you &apos;re going to play a piece of today , that was recently a hundred years ago , <unk> or a half hundred years ago ?
now , the instruments are <unk> .
and there was a instrument in the time , as a instrument , there &apos;s no piano .
it wasn &apos;t never invented .
i think it was excited to be excited if he had had the <unk> possibilities of today &apos;s modern <unk> .
i can see the <unk> , which was the <unk> , to sound on the modern wing to sound , which is not going to be a <unk> <unk> .
and by beethoven , you know , he heard more than he had been <unk> .
today , a modern orchestra is able to play everything , which is a orchestra from the time as <unk> .
that &apos;s why the yemen on us are going to be <unk> the pieces of all the things back back .
so they &apos;re going to be <unk> , which is what they &apos;ve been aware of the spirit .
and also , what you &apos;re thinking about today is the mind .
or that &apos;s what i mean today , because what you might think about .
thank you .
you know what fail ?
did you have been <unk> ?
and how did it feel like this ?
<unk> .
i &apos;ve got a friend , which is going to be a <unk> .
so if i come out with my little <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m going to see that feeling is going on .
i &apos;m going to put something through the head .
i say , <unk> , what do you need to do as the n big car ?
this is already about half of his value in the first year half of his value .
and yet , you &apos;re going to work much less than i do .
why do i have to afford the n little car ?
and then , i &apos;m looking at this , that &apos;s kind of <unk> .
it &apos;s about justice .
and as i say , the word justice is , it &apos;s this awful sense .
our organism has invented a great method to make these <unk> feelings like bad .
you can also try to talk to words like <unk> or <unk> or something .
i want to share with you with this mechanism today , or some of the details that you &apos;re probably familiar with .
and the mechanism comes from dinner .
but if you don &apos;t think about what you might be heard when people say , if people say , no one has to build the courage to build a wall .
and then rocks <unk> , so he <unk> them to look at them .
one of them , you can see that the <unk> self doesn &apos;t believe what he says .
it &apos;s easy to see the <unk> that he &apos;s different in the sense of doing this .
it &apos;s not only about it , and not yourself .
no , who i talk about that i &apos;m talking about to do this , that it <unk> itself .
they need this email to be a <unk> , to get a <unk> <unk> .
you can make them less easy , yes , <unk> or <unk> .
they need time .
and this time is a anecdote that you might be familiar with this time that you might know .
the spanish painter <unk> picasso once had a woman <unk> .
this woman came up with , the wheel wouldn &apos;t be able to see it .
journalists , waiting , wait for it .
it will always be similar .
in this point , and if you laugh , you see how important this email is , and how much time you need to experience something that artists can tell us about what artists are very good for us .
because artists have a <unk> relationship with dinner .
the artists show you something like this , and all of this lady , which you don &apos;t see if you just look at the mirror of the mirror .
so , the artists show you in one of this <unk> , which is what you &apos;re not going to be familiar with when you look at this artwork .
and then it turns out this awful sense , it might not be similar to you , and it &apos;s still going to be similar .
so here you have this mechanism that we can use the email as a great invention to <unk> our <unk> .
and not only in art of art , also in the <unk> , in the <unk> , in which the mythology , in stories , it turns out .
you might know this idea of the lady who looked every morning in the mirror of the mirror , and he asked him who &apos;s the most famous in the entire country ?
one day , this is the mirror , yes , there &apos;s a <unk> .
behind the seven mountains and so forth .
and they also know how much <unk> out of this is true , but the mirror is not going to describe the mirror , that &apos;s true .
but we should just tell us that you can &apos;t tell a woman that you can &apos;t say that there &apos;s a <unk> somewhere else .
here it &apos;s needed to understand what we &apos;re going to understand under <unk> <unk> .
we need this day that i &apos;ve got the deception <unk> , without which we can &apos;t exist yet .
we don &apos;t only have in art , in the <unk> , but also in the science of the science of this great story .
and there &apos;s this story from the woman of <unk> <unk> .
she heard about this book of charles darwin , the origin of species and the <unk> of people .
that &apos;s the people who wanted to <unk> from the monkeys and , yes , there &apos;s a common ancestor between people and monkeys .
and then they went to her husband , and she said , &quot; well , that &apos;s not true , which was not true .
the human is about the monkeys of the monkeys , or a common ancestors .
no , no , no , that &apos;s not .
and if it &apos;s true , we need to prevent the people that people know about it .
why do we have to prevent people think about something if it &apos;s true ?
because we can &apos;t live there without life .
because we have this <unk> , this sense of being great , <unk> from the highest nature , not from one of these <unk> , from so something that exists as a organism , which exists in a rock , and that &apos;s how things like that , that &apos;s for us .
so , we can &apos;t see these things .
we need to prevent that the people are learning about things , especially when they &apos;re true .
and so you can see how slowly this mechanism , and how the animations look at something that he goes on to something else as on this great image of us , i want to get some other story in front of us , and i want to show you another story .
a particularly beautiful story i mean .
my wife told me to me .
she came from school from the school , she &apos;s a teacher , and she told about a student .
a <unk> student .
she likes to be interested in , because he &apos;s a decision to <unk> .
and she asked him , what are your <unk> ?
and there he says , well , i &apos;m in the <unk> .
and because i am in the <unk> , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
yeah , you know , if you &apos;re <unk> in this place , it &apos;s not true .
i said to my wife , always when a person in a moral story , is that we should try to use it through the <unk> , we should try to replace it through the <unk> though .
take that once , and then you learn the sentence .
although i am in the <unk> , i &apos;m interested in <unk> things .
and you feel the real truth behind <unk> .
so a little <unk> , which is interested in it , not for <unk> .
it &apos;s interested in <unk> .
but there &apos;s no <unk> that we can look at how to learn where you &apos;re learning how to do fire .
there &apos;s only the second person , the <unk> .
and he &apos;s got to put it up .
and <unk> , you don &apos;t say his teacher , that you want to put your teacher out somewhere else , and i &apos;m happy when the fire was <unk> .
no , it just looks much better if we show that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to use the <unk> that other other , if you put it into fire .
here you have this little mechanism .
this is what this <unk> is that the <unk> of the <unk> knew that he really knew about the fire , but that he doesn &apos;t want to say that he can &apos;t say that .
so here they have this <unk> between the <unk> and the conscious thing that you can do is to do something about it , and the things that you know is that they can see something else , and the things that you know is that they can see much better for you and others can be able to be able to be able to do a lot better for them and others .
so , it &apos;s just like these words that we &apos;re also using in the language of the power of the power that we &apos;re going to use in the language .
in fact , we know something different of the case .
but we know , if we know that , the social <unk> are very sensitive .
we can &apos;t do that .
it &apos;s impossible , these things in a society that &apos;s going to work in a society that &apos;s working on .
i want to tell you about what we found in my institute .
so , in terms of the logic , these mutations , the willingness to follow a different reality as the ones that we actually know about in the <unk> knowledge is that it &apos;s easier to spread from the outside .
this is what i want to show you two , maybe three examples .
the first example shows what many of you know , and some of you are suffering , and some of you are suffering , very few times .
i mean the soul .
what is the soul ?
the soul is so something of the intellectual , says about <unk> .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s not about stop <unk> , physical nature .
and if you &apos;ve got people who are <unk> , you know that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have a soul , or you can also say that they have a soul , or blood , something like that , it was like the spirit of life and blood , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , yes .
and from this soul you think that it &apos;s kind of in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , in this <unk> nature , <unk> , <unk> .
and if this <unk> comes across the people , it &apos;s going to be <unk> with the mind , with nature , with nature , with nature that can only live , yes with the soul .
and then he can <unk> .
this is the idea of how the soul works .
so it &apos;s about the outside of the outside .
so we &apos;re going to think of it as something that is necessarily going to be familiar for our lives .
and if you have this assumption , you &apos;re understanding the logic that we &apos;re thinking about this happiness , with a <unk> , to make our world better .
because now you can use a <unk> .
<unk> , you know , you know from school .
this is now a <unk> , which shows us a logic .
that &apos;s the most exciting part of my talk .
this is what you need to do is fear , but also the willingness to lie .
so , to think that they can just make this logic wrong .
in this <unk> , three sentences came out .
the first sentence is , <unk> said , there is no soul .
so the second sentence is , if <unk> is right , he doesn &apos;t have the soul .
now , there &apos;s a third sentence .
i &apos;ve done him here here .
and the third sentence , who &apos;s right with people who have a strong feeling for a soul .
and you say , who doesn &apos;t have the soul , which is dead , and can &apos;t tell you nothing .
and this is what you &apos;re doing here .
this is the logic in this , yes , in this <unk> talk to the expression .
you can see it immediately .
the first two sentences , they &apos;re terrible correct .
i can tell you all of this .
the logic doesn &apos;t matter about reality .
i can tell you , the <unk> is a man .
and if i &apos;m right , the <unk> is a man .
if i don &apos;t have right , the <unk> is not a man .
the logic doesn &apos;t think about what &apos;s going on .
i can tell all of this .
but critical is , if i &apos;m right , it &apos;s going to be true .
so if <unk> says , there is no soul .
secondly , if he &apos;s right , he didn &apos;t have the soul .
these things are inevitable .
and now , our <unk> consciousness is right now that you can do something like that .
it depends on a third sentence that doesn &apos;t have anything to do with the first two sentences , and that &apos;s how the opposite of the first sentence is already discovered and <unk> .
because in fact , we have to prove whether it &apos;s the soul or not .
but with this logic that it &apos;s easy to use that two sentences is inevitable , and a third <unk> , which looks like he would have to do something that we can save our <unk> .
so , we &apos;re doing that , as if it doesn &apos;t really seem to live without a soul .
and we &apos;re very happy about that .
we can get these things on different examples .
in the present , we &apos;ve got a very modern example , and that &apos;s always a very modern example .
this is what you have to do is another <unk> issue , a <unk> from philosophy , you know .
that has to do that we go back to the <unk> century .
there was a <unk> , who was called <unk> <unk> , and after that is the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> , which is made of real nature .
it doesn &apos;t have this soul .
this is such a <unk> .
and if you look at the right in the middle between two <unk> <unk> , it <unk> .
because he doesn &apos;t know what we &apos;re going to do .
so it &apos;s right in the middle of the middle .
this is how the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> forces with <unk> <unk> use each other .
it doesn &apos;t happen at all .
only if you put a different example , if you look at this , if you look at that a <unk> bigger , it doesn &apos;t need a reason , and it doesn &apos;t need any reason to do it .
and he goes to the right thoughts .
so if you &apos;ve got this idea that you &apos;re kind of <unk> in nature , <unk> , from the larger amount that you &apos;re going to put on , and then you also have a little bit easier to feel that it &apos;s like a free will have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something like a free will .
and if we &apos;ve done here in <unk> in <unk> , i remember the <unk> of <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> , which is called <unk> <unk> , and he said to him , <unk> <unk> said , there is no <unk> .
now , we can make the second sentence , and you can say , if <unk> <unk> is right , he doesn &apos;t have <unk> .
these sentences are absolutely inevitable and correct .
and what we &apos;re going to read is almost every day in the newspaper , that &apos;s what you find in this third sentence .
and that looks like this , who doesn &apos;t have the <unk> , it doesn &apos;t also be able to go to your actions and <unk> to responsibility , and it &apos;s <unk> .
and here they have to get it back .
in fact , you &apos;ve got to explain whether there &apos;s something like <unk> .
but the logic of deception allows us to do that , as the first sentence of the beginning of the moment , as a second sentence , you would have to think of the opposite .
and now you can see if you want to make yourself anything , if you want to test yourself something , and i think , if you want to make people happy , these courage to come up .
so , for example , this is , if you look at some people who you can tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
and please don &apos;t use the german word for <unk> , which is called <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to call that that would be a little bit <unk> .
tell you , there &apos;s no <unk> .
in fact , they &apos;re going to be one , for example , of course , of course , that can &apos;t show you .
and you &apos;ve got a problem .
because while they &apos;re working on it , you can &apos;t prove that you can &apos;t prove that there &apos;s no <unk> , the man is very happy .
he &apos;s very happy about that , because he <unk> it .
because he &apos;s taken it on a <unk> , which he didn &apos;t do it in the way that he didn &apos;t care about .
because in fact , this man is not interested in evidence .
it &apos;s just interested in the way that we need to prove to realize that there are <unk> .
so , in the way , in the way of <unk> , you &apos;re going to see the <unk> of dinner .
and if you have a chance to feel like a possibility to be able to be able to feel in other people , they &apos;re doing it , because they &apos;re going to make other happy , if you don &apos;t remember it in this way .
i thank you for your attention .
yeah , good day .
i allowed me to ask <unk> if i &apos;d like to mention them .
it &apos;s one of the <unk> here of this great event , and i asked myself if i &apos;m going to get a talk here , and that &apos;s my idea .
i have to say honestly , you know , it &apos;s <unk> , it was hard to talk about my idea .
and i think maybe my <unk> , i &apos;m trying to imagine you &apos;re trying to introduce you .
but , of course , the sum is very much , very many ideas .
i &apos;ve probably heard the two beautiful girls , and i &apos;ve probably heard about the generation that the bad <unk> of the picture , because i &apos;ve been <unk> to study surgery in <unk> , virtual university , today , that &apos;s what i think is <unk> .
and i &apos;ve got the middle of the 80s after berlin <unk> , because i wanted to do renewable energy , and that was not in <unk> .
there was the <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> was all <unk> , and the <unk> was called <unk> .
this is <unk> today .
because a good engineer , there &apos;s no great car built or <unk> .
but something like the n like the n <unk> , which is kind of a hundred watts from the square meter , which was a toy .
and in berlin , there was a <unk> <unk> .
i am grateful grateful that he took the word back back to the word , because after the <unk> , you didn &apos;t have to use the word , because all the left was bad .
but it was not like this in the <unk> years .
and it was like this was that there was <unk> <unk> , and one of them was sitting in <unk> in the <unk> , where you <unk> the evil .
so , in the <unk> , but that was called <unk> , and that was called the wind and the energy , and i was at the middle of the &apos; 80s .
and yes , a lot of what i was told about today was very , because many , many beautiful , many beautiful areas that i &apos;ve been doing .
i &apos;ve been working at 11 years in the collective , that was <unk> .
we were 17 people .
if one said , if one said , the <unk> , that has been a completely <unk> . i &apos;ve got a lot of <unk> , and i &apos;ve got a lot of years ago , because all the colleagues of my father would always be <unk> , you &apos;ve got the money on the window , you &apos;ve got the money on the window , you &apos;ve got the money on your child .
it &apos;s going to work with <unk> .
and that was really very , very , very <unk> , and you &apos;re going to go back to the same phase , which was a picture on the way that i asked me for 10 years ago , a thousand <unk> , which was at the same time , <unk> , <unk> in the collective , of course , whether that really is the great thing to be the great .
and i put it down to <unk> <unk> , and then we &apos;ve been <unk> with friends , and i &apos;ve got <unk> of the company <unk> , which was one of the most of the most of the largest <unk> of the world of the world .
now , a <unk> , but also , we have the problem , of course , the problem of a <unk> farmer , and we have <unk> , a little group , decided that we &apos;re going to start and forth to the next topic of the future , and that &apos;s what i think , it &apos;s just crazy , and that &apos;s where people say , it &apos;s just crazy , we &apos;re talking about .
and there i &apos;ve got a project that i &apos;d like to imagine that i &apos;d like to imagine .
and the title of the talk was , it &apos;s like to be a hundred percent renewable .
and we just started to ask with a relatively <unk> story , which is where you could use a memory of understanding today .
on this island , this is the island of <unk> on the <unk> .
yes , that &apos;s the data .
there are millions of thousands of people living .
now , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of 15 percent .
and the question is , why don &apos;t they have more ?
it doesn &apos;t look .
if they <unk> more <unk> , it starts to fail to fail .
so i &apos;m going to tell you about the politicians when they <unk> in <unk> our <unk> .
they &apos;re always saying , why ?
we &apos;ve got twenty percent in germany .
don &apos;t be a problem .
but not , we &apos;ve got seven percent and our net , in fact , we &apos;ve seen the european union .
if we had eight percent , we would have had the same problems that people in this island has been there .
the question was simple , that was <unk> , the first <unk> of the island of the island of the island , but it &apos;s just <unk> .
so , as big as a battery , if you &apos;re going to be a battery , you &apos;re going to be like a island on twenty , 22 , 40 , 50 , maybe even 70 percent of renewable .
and yes , i &apos;m going to go back to the <unk> .
the conventional system looks at the world all over the world .
by the way , a year of about a hundred <unk> electrical performance on <unk> <unk> on the world .
this is based on the performance of a hundred power , because that &apos;s particularly fast everywhere .
the <unk> of the world , which is happening , is going to be <unk> , because you don &apos;t need it to have a <unk> .
this is fast .
you take a <unk> box .
and then it looks like this .
in this time , three of the <unk> , two of the <unk> , two are always waiting .
yeah , this is what &apos;s the bottom line on the bottom .
we also have to get very closely data .
and the <unk> , or the <unk> , or whatever it is , is in the rule of a <unk> system or a system , which is only a <unk> system , or a system , which is just <unk> in small amounts of here .
our goal was just to say , okay , okay .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> and the wind , the sun , the sun is so that they can see the bigger percentage .
and if you want to go over twenty , 22 percent , so energy per year is not the performance in the moment , and then they have to move the <unk> .
that means , in the moment , you &apos;ve got to worry that renewable energy is going to be able to take the entire net .
and of course , you can only see if you &apos;re in some kind of , and you &apos;re going to be <unk> here .
that hasn &apos;t done anything else on the world .
so this is in the small form , so you can also use your <unk> in the car of a little <unk> .
people always ask me , what do you want to do with it , right ?
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
but if you want to get several of these <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s going to build a net , it will be extremely complicated .
and our goal was , we wanted to go to 70 percent renewable , and then there &apos;s one of the rest of the rest of the last 10 , 20 percent renewable <unk> , which is going to be very , very expensive , very expensive , and that &apos;s not going to work that it &apos;s not going to work out of batteries .
this is going to be a resource in every case , which is , hydrogen , methane , power to gas , you know , or <unk> , that &apos;s going to be going to be .
they need to go out to a <unk> , and <unk> , and not only <unk> .
we just wanted to know what is because with a normal , <unk> <unk> battery .
how far else do you get ?
and then there &apos;s a whole lot of instability .
and they have the wind and the sun and the <unk> , and they came up to the result , a very exciting result that you &apos;ve got to be in the biological system that you need to be a middle of about 2,000 cents a half dollars a hundred cents a hundred cents .
these were the great calculations before six years ago .
and then we said , okay .
well , it &apos;s great , then we have a business model .
we &apos;re cheaper like the <unk> , when the <unk> spends five percent a year .
and then we &apos;ve been starting with the <unk> .
what would we have to do ?
with investors with investors , i &apos;ve got new <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have five people to build a way to create the society again .
and here again , the impression .
the brown is kind of the fundamental system , the green system is our system .
so , our system is also a <unk> system , because we &apos;re going to do 20 percent of <unk> , and also a <unk> <unk> on the other things .
and the <unk> , which is the <unk> on the island of the island , which is what we find .
so let &apos;s let us support , but we don &apos;t believe that you can solve the technical problem .
and so we decided to build a desert in berlin , where we &apos;re going to be able to build the electrical <unk> of the island of one to three times .
that means we &apos;re going to start to find the biggest battery of the world &apos;s world .
here you are .
and that comes from asia , in the case of japan , in the case of japan .
and <unk> , it &apos;s in the &apos; 70s in the &apos; 70s , today <unk> , we &apos;ve been developed , and then it was <unk> to the japanese .
you can see it &apos;s a very , very large battery .
it has a fiction performance , and there &apos;s six hours long to get this performance , and this is the battery that we have to have <unk> <unk> .
and then they put them out .
we also have one of these <unk> in the same size of the same size , as he &apos;s sitting there in the galapagos , in fact , in the galapagos , it looks like that , in the back of the <unk> , there &apos;s the big battery , there &apos;s the big battery , here &apos;s all the <unk> that we &apos;re doing with the net .
this is what we &apos;ve done over here , and the <unk> of the cable , the <unk> of the tubes , to be able to see the <unk> in the net .
and here you can see the whole thing .
we can also use <unk> <unk> <unk> on the net .
here we see that again , we &apos;re going to see this time , here &apos;s all the time , there &apos;s all the time .
and what we &apos;ve done since , since <unk> was the <unk> , until today , we &apos;ve done all sorts of <unk> , which is happening between the individual system in electronics , to develop software , we &apos;ve done .
so we &apos;re not <unk> , but we define ourselves as a company that &apos;s only between the subject battery and the subject of the web and everything in between .
you have to communicate , of course , to communicate , you need to communicate into the net , and that &apos;s very complicated .
the nice thing about the theme is that you can see on this island today today , all the <unk> can be able to increase if we want to increase our percentage of renewables .
so , this whole debate , like this is going to go back to the moment and <unk> , <unk> , how to go on the island of the island , for example , for <unk> to 200,000 percent <unk> , so we <unk> the wind and the sun .
<unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> .
so <unk> , a <unk> <unk> everywhere .
we can begin to change the island of the island , <unk> , <unk> , you can use the <unk> .
that means if you &apos;re in <unk> percent , you &apos;re not going to be able to do that without memory .
you can go through the n <unk> , you can see through <unk> , yes , you should be able to do in every case , the amount of <unk> , but you &apos;re never going to be able to get on memory .
and this is how the n little bit of the message .
so many people are going to go and look at this , because you can see what &apos;s the problems you get .
if we turn to the <unk> , you don &apos;t have more the <unk> mass , which is a certain <unk> in the net .
and our <unk> <unk> is basically the only <unk> mass of <unk> <unk> of big <unk> , where the wave of the neurons are in all over europe .
we &apos;re looking at this net in this web , the 50 pants , and if it &apos;s going to be <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re going to start a couple of <unk> <unk> , and then we &apos;re going to go back to a little bit <unk> , and then we come back to it .
that &apos;s the system .
and of course , this is incredibly <unk> .
if you put it somewhere else , it takes a lot of time .
the <unk> threat is at least 10 seconds to think about the web .
and in the time , you can react to other other .
if you don &apos;t have more , these <unk> mass , you have to replace this with <unk> and <unk> .
and we can go with this big battery in front of this big battery .
and then you can see what enormous <unk> there is there .
and the message is now , we need to be able to use this <unk> mass , if we look at our goals twenty , twenty , 20 percent , 20 , 20,000 , 22 percent and so forth when we want to achieve all the time .
and then we need to be able to put our <unk> benefits in the net .
<unk> doesn &apos;t mean , the power is going on to be able to keep the frequency .
yeah , this is a <unk> in the moment , <unk> from the <unk> , because we don &apos;t exist , or <unk> , because that &apos;s not going to be .
and we just try to make sure that you can get the ability to get the <unk> capacity , <unk> <unk> , depending on the net .
so , we have a whole lot of studies now .
and in this purpose , people are always looking at the people and look at our <unk> on the way that we are doing .
and yes , the discussion is always about the question , as far as you can see there &apos;s a piece of the future .
and a lot of discussions that i had in the last six years was similar to the discussion of the discussion that i had in the last 30 years .
it doesn &apos;t matter , <unk> , <unk> , we &apos;ve got it all out , you never know .
we &apos;ve got 22 <unk> <unk> in germany .
this is <unk> .
and i just go out that we &apos;re going to have the same capacity in the next 30 years , the same capacity that are going to have the same capacity .
it &apos;s easy to get it out .
it &apos;s going to be a whole amount of <unk> , and we &apos;re going to give it a whole lot of <unk> .
and the beautiful thing is that i &apos;ve seen now in the last two years , that the scientists have seen on my side .
we &apos;ve got about 10 million <unk> <unk> , also to be able to be able to go to the german net .
this is going to happen in the next april .
so , you can see that there is a change , and it &apos;s only about this <unk> , and it &apos;s only about the idea , a hundred percent renewable is true .
and if you have a hundred percent renewable , it &apos;s like a <unk> system .
and we &apos;re always trying to do in discussions , these <unk> , which is going to be <unk> , they have a own little net , which has to do with our <unk> .
now , the question is really simple if they &apos;re completely likely to make a lot of fossil or <unk> <unk> , which is going to be <unk> in the world , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be a island .
then they only use that what &apos;s about the sun and wind there , where they live .
and this is a little bit of our vision of a <unk> energy , and i &apos;m also grateful , and i &apos;m also grateful that they have said that they &apos;re going to use energy .
and this is what we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , and the talk about <unk> <unk> , that you can be able to be able to be a <unk> and use energy , there &apos;s a little bit together .
and yes , i &apos;m going to encourage you to encourage you , in the sense that you can be quiet , and you can also have a vision .
and you really have to get a really pretty <unk> , but i think it &apos;s going to be .
thank you .
as steve <unk> , the <unk> of los angeles times , one day by the streets in the center of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music .
she came from a man , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , homeless , homeless , who had only two <unk> .
many of you are going to know the story , because from <unk> papers , it was a book that was <unk> , with robert <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , who was in the <unk> , and he was arrested by his <unk> schizophrenia .
<unk> left <unk> , <unk> , a <unk> and 30 years later , he lived as a president on the streets of <unk> square kilometers in the center of los angeles .
i forgot to read all of you to read <unk> book or to see the film , so you don &apos;t just understand the wonderful <unk> that &apos;s between these two men , but also , as they thought that music is allowed to make this connection , the <unk> , <unk> way from the road .
i met mr. <unk> <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , in <unk> disney <unk> hall .
he just had a map from the <unk> first and fourth symphony , and i was sitting behind the stage to tell me .
he talked to a very <unk> , and <unk> says about <unk> <unk> and <unk> clinton , like the people would never create it in the baseball world <unk> , and that &apos;s because of the <unk> side of the first economist in the last sentence .
we came to talk about music . and a couple of days later , i got a email , which was that <unk> <unk> for me .
i &apos;ve got to say that <unk> was a medical treatment , because he was already working with <unk> , and we &apos;ve been treated with <unk> and <unk> , a <unk> that has been <unk> his entire life .
so , as a result , it &apos;s particularly <unk> for these <unk> stages . these are sometimes so bad , and he &apos;s raped days , in the streets of <unk> square miles , all of this <unk> and the <unk> of his own mind .
and in the same way , in fact , <unk> was , when we started with our first school , in the <unk> disney valley , he started this <unk> <unk> in his eyes , and he had been completely lost in his eyes .
he talked about invisible <unk> and smoke , and that &apos;s what someone wanted to do in sleep .
i was afraid , not <unk> , but i was afraid that i could get it into one of his states , and that i could destroy him in one of his world , and that i could destroy him to <unk> his relationship , if i started to talk about shape and <unk> and other exciting forms of <unk> <unk> .
so i just started playing .
i played the first sentence of the car <unk> .
and while i was sitting in , i heard that in <unk> eyes have a complete change .
it was , as if he was under the impact of a invisible <unk> , a chemical response , which was my game .
<unk> <unk> <unk> anger in understanding , in a <unk> curiosity , and that &apos;s how to do .
and as a miracle from a miracle , he took his <unk> and started to play a couple of <unk> from <unk> , and asked me to play them : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
so we started talking about music , starting from the <unk> of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , from <unk> to <unk> .
and i realized he doesn &apos;t only have a <unk> knowledge about music , but it &apos;s also a <unk> personal relationship .
he talked about her with a passion , and a understanding that i &apos;ve just heard about my colleagues in the <unk> of los angeles .
because he was written about music , and i was talking about music , i was from this <unk> , soft man , who was still <unk> by the streets of los angeles , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
music is medicine . music changes us .
for <unk> , music is emotional health .
because the music allows it to him , his thoughts and sadness with the help of his imagination and creativity in a difference .
and so he <unk> his <unk> <unk> .
i understood that exactly this is the nature of art .
so this is the reason we &apos;re doing music : we &apos;re doing something that we have in all of us , deep in the <unk> , our feelings , through our artistic lens , through our creativity .
and the reality of this expression is all of us , and moving , and it &apos;s inspired us .
in a community <unk> , so he took the music back to a community of friends .
the <unk> force of music brought him back to a family of musicians who understood him that his talent , and it <unk> him .
and i &apos;m going to go back with <unk> music , whether it &apos;s in <unk> disney <unk> , or in <unk> hours , because he reminds me why i &apos;ve become musician .
thank you .
ed <unk> : thank you . thank you .
david <unk> .
robert <unk> : i want to play something that i was <unk> <unk> .
i hope i hope you .
so i &apos;ve heard a lot of fish in my life .
i only loved two loved .
this first , that was more like a strange <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
what a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> after the <unk> of the richest standards of sustainability .
so you couldn &apos;t feel like to sell him .
i had this beauty a relationship about several months ago .
one day , the boss of the company , and i asked if i could give you a event about the sustainability of the farm in the farm of the farm .
and of course , i said .
so here was a company that tried to solve what this horrible problem for our <unk> problem is that we &apos;re going to get fish on our <unk> ?
and in the last 50 years , we &apos;ve got the oceans , as we &apos;ve got the world , as we &apos;ve got the forests of algae in the last 50 years .
it &apos;s hard to <unk> the destruction .
so , 95 percent of the big fish that we love , the tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they &apos;re developed .
it &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , you &apos;re going to be <unk> , or <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
many of the things about this . <unk> <unk> the environment that most of you are , and they &apos;re alcohol , we take tuna .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
it &apos;s called 15 pounds <unk> , so you need to get a pounds of <unk> .
not very sustainable .
it &apos;s not very good .
so , there was a company that was trying to do it right now .
i wanted to do them .
at the day , i said , i called the boss of <unk> for the company .
let &apos;s tell him nothing .
&quot; sorry , &quot; i said , &quot; only to get the facts right now , you &apos;re famous for that far out in the ocean , that you don &apos;t know the environment . &quot;
&quot; this is true , &quot; he said , &quot; we &apos;re so far out that the waste of our fish is not <unk> . &quot;
and then he <unk> , &quot; we &apos;re basically a living world .
this <unk> from <unk> to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; the best in the industry . &quot;
<unk> to one , great .
&quot; <unk> to one of what ? what does you do ? &quot;
sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said .
and at that evening , i was sitting in bed in bed , and i thought , what &apos;s a sustainable protein ?
so , i said at the next day , briefly , the event , you know .
i said , &quot; listen , what is sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he &apos;s going to ask .
well , i <unk> with a few people in the company , no one could give me a <unk> answer , until i finally put out of students .
let &apos;s call him sure .
&quot; sorry , &quot; i said , &quot; what is sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yes , <unk> , skin , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and food . &quot;
i said , &quot; how much percent of your <unk> is chicken ? &quot;
in the phoenix , maybe two percent .
&quot; well , that &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; listen , what is sustainable to feed the chicken ? &quot;
there was a long meal in the <unk> , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken on the world . &quot;
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
that &apos;s what i am .
no , i &apos;ve actually been <unk> by this fish , because i swear to god , the fish of these entertainment to be chicken .
this second fish , this is a different kind of love .
it &apos;s the romantic way , the way that you learn to be able to think of your fish , you learn the fish of the fish .
and i heard him first in a restaurant in <unk> .
a <unk> journalist had been talking about this fish for a long time .
it &apos;s kind of <unk> .
he came up on the table with a <unk> , almost <unk> white color .
the chef had <unk> him .
thank you .
sadly , it was still delicious .
what can make a fish so good after he was <unk> ?
i can &apos;t do it , but this guy can do it .
let &apos;s call him <unk> . in fact , he &apos;s called <unk> .
and no , he doesn &apos;t <unk> the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef . at least on the way that they &apos;re doing , and i understand .
he &apos;s a biologist called <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner of the streets .
it &apos;s near the <unk> of the river .
and in the 1980s , the farm was in the hands of <unk> .
they were <unk> <unk> on what &apos;s essentially <unk> .
they made that , by the country , <unk> the country .
they built these complicated <unk> of <unk> , and they were <unk> water from the country and out in the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make that that worked , not access .
and it was a catastrophe .
it took about 90 percent of the birds around what &apos;s going to be a lot of birds .
and so 1970 was a spanish company to buy the country in the country .
what did they do ?
they have the river in the bottom of the water .
they literally have the <unk> <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> , they used the government , to <unk> the water back .
they <unk> the <unk> .
they created a <unk> of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- and they have <unk> , and his company , and his company , the ecological destruction are completely <unk> .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you never saw something else else .
they move out on the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see is <unk> <unk> , and this density , <unk> march .
i didn &apos;t have a long time in front of this .
he &apos;s an incredible guy , three parts charles darwin , and a part of the <unk> .
okay ? there were us , and they were <unk> by the <unk> , and i <unk> and <unk> , <unk> to my knees , and <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is what he <unk> a rare <unk> .
now , he said the <unk> of <unk> .
and here , here , he sees a pattern of <unk> , which is about the <unk> <unk> .
it turns out that <unk> the biggest part of his career in the <unk> national park in africa .
i asked him how to be a <unk> .
he said , &quot; fish ? i don &apos;t know about fish .
i &apos;m an expert for relationships . &quot;
and then he goes down to more talking about rare birds and algae and curious <unk> .
and you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love with love .
and my head became weak about this <unk> piece of <unk> fish that i had the <unk> .
so i got it . i said , &quot; <unk> , how does it get your fish so good ? &quot;
he showed the algae .
&quot; i know , boy , the algae , the <unk> , the relationships , that &apos;s incredible .
but what do your fish eat ?
how is the <unk> ? &quot;
well , he &apos;s going to tell me that it &apos;s such a <unk> system that is so much that the fish will eat what they &apos;re going to eat in the wild .
the <unk> biomass , the <unk> , the <unk> , that &apos;s what the fish is .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s completely <unk> .
there is no food .
the one of a farm is heard of their animals ?
after the day , i went back to this site with <unk> around , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems to be so obvious , &quot; different than every farm i had ever had , &quot; how do you make success ? &quot;
and in the moment , it was like a director that would have been an <unk> .
and we <unk> around the corner , and we &apos;ve been able to get the most amazing thing , thousands and thousands of billions of <unk> , a literally gram of the eye of the eye .
&quot; this is success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at your <unk> , pink .
they <unk> . &quot;
<unk> ? i was absolutely confused .
i said , &quot; <unk> , don &apos;t you <unk> your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and <unk> in the birds .
well , last year , in this site , <unk> birds , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s been the biggest and one of the most important private <unk> in the united states .
i said , &quot; <unk> , is a good <unk> <unk> , not the last one that you want to have in a <unk> ? &quot;
he flew his head , no .
he said , &quot; we &apos;re building <unk> , not better .
this is a <unk> network .
the <unk> eat the <unk> .
and the <unk> eat the <unk> .
so the installations of the belly is the power of the system . &quot;
okay , let &apos;s put it up . there &apos;s a farm who doesn &apos;t move their animals and a farm farm , which is <unk> their success on the health of their health .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and by the way , this <unk> should not even be there .
they <unk> in a city of 5,000 miles away , where the <unk> is better for the <unk> .
every morning they fly 12 kilometers to the farm .
and every night they fly 12 kilometers back .
they &apos;re doing this because they can follow the <unk> white line of <unk> .
seriously .
i had a kind of journey of penguins , so i looked at <unk> .
and i said , &quot; <unk> , fly to the farm of the farm and fly , and then they fly 12 kilometers back to the night ?
do you do that for children ? &quot;
he looked at me when i was just a song of <unk> <unk> .
he said , &quot; no . you do this , because the food is better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my beloved fish that was delicious , and i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> . i don &apos;t like <unk> .
it &apos;s this <unk> , <unk> taste .
i &apos;m almost never going to do that .
and yet , when i tried them in this restaurant in <unk> , they didn &apos;t have to be <unk> .
they wanted to be cute , and in fact , if you would take a <unk> from the ocean .
i mentioned this to <unk> , and he <unk> .
he said , &quot; the skin is possible like a <unk> .
it &apos;s the last <unk> , before something in the body .
it &apos;s developed in the time of evolution , to <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and then he created , &quot; but our water doesn &apos;t have <unk> . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t turn their fish . a farm , which is going to take their success on the success of their <unk> .
and i realized when he says , he says a farm , who doesn &apos;t have <unk> , it &apos;s enormous , because the water that comes through this farm comes from the river of the river .
it &apos;s a river that has all the things that make things out of the rivers of the rivers that we tend to create chemical <unk> , <unk> by <unk> .
and if it <unk> through the system , and this leaves is the water clean , as it <unk> .
the system is so healthy , it <unk> the water .
so , not only a farm , which is not only a farm , not only a farm that is <unk> their success on the health of their <unk> , but it &apos;s a farm , and not only for those fish , but also for you and me .
because when the water <unk> , it <unk> in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it out , and that &apos;s what you should do , because these love , like the <unk> , is also <unk> .
you could say that it &apos;s a recipe for the future of the future , whether we talk about <unk> or <unk> .
what we need now is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food , in the food , in the food .
but for many people , it &apos;s a little bit too radical .
we &apos;re not <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> . we &apos;re <unk> .
we love <unk> . we love little <unk> . we &apos;re talking about social food . we &apos;re talking about social food .
and if you say that this is the things that the future is going to be good food is someone else , and he says , &quot; hey , people , i love <unk> <unk> , but how are they going to feed the world ?
how are they going to feed the world ? &quot;
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t like this question .
no , not because we &apos;re going to produce enough calories to feed the world more than only to feed .
there are a billion people living today .
a billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of <unk> <unk> in the distribution , not the <unk> .
well , i don &apos;t like this question because they don &apos;t have the logic of our <unk> , the last 50 years .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and the entire time was simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re more people cheaper , &quot; if we feed more people cheaper , how awful can that be ? &quot;
that was the cause . it was the story . it was the <unk> of american agriculture .
we should call them what it is , a <unk> in <unk> , a <unk> , which is fast <unk> capital , which allows that production .
this is not a <unk> , and it &apos;s not agriculture .
our <unk> is <unk> today , not because <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources .
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through <unk> country , not through filters , but through <unk> water , not by <unk> , but through forests , and not through <unk> and nets , but through fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start with the question : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that use every community to feed themselves ?
to do this , you don &apos;t look at the <unk> for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s done .
so , chemistry and chemistry and machines are <unk> , and it never created something really good for food .
let &apos;s look at the ecological model .
this is that , in two billion years , <unk> <unk> .
look at <unk> , farmers like <unk> .
people who don &apos;t have the worlds for us , businesses , the invitation instead of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , rather than just better , farmers who are not only <unk> , but experts for relationships , they &apos;re not only <unk> , but experts for relationships .
because they are the ones that are also experts for taste .
and if i &apos;m really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;m going to be ever going to be .
you know , i &apos;m right , because if this is the future of the future , it will be delicious .
thank you .
now , if i want to share with you today , it &apos;s the most important thing that we consume , bigger than the sum of your parts and instead of <unk> , i want you to think about how we can use information so that the pattern can make patterns , and we can see the trends that would not be visible .
so what we &apos;re seeing here is a typical <unk> for age of age .
the program that i use here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and what i can do with <unk> is that i can filter for a certain component , we say accidents .
and right , i see a different pattern that makes it possible .
and that &apos;s because in the <unk> here , the people are on the <unk> , and they &apos;re on the <unk> .
we can go back to a step further and see the data , and you can see that <unk> and cancer is the usual <unk> , but not for each other .
now , if we go back to age , we &apos;re going to say 40 years or england , we see accidents are even the most important thing that people should worry about .
and who sees the <unk> , that &apos;s actually true of men .
so you can see that the view of information and data in this way is really remembered in a <unk> <unk> .
and if we don &apos;t do this for data , why don &apos;t we do that for content itself ?
now , what we have here is the <unk> of every single person who had ever been <unk> .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all online .
you can talk to my talk after my talk .
with <unk> , you can put them into a decade of a decade .
and you can get <unk> in a particular year .
you can draw directly to a certain copy .
now , if i look at here , i see the <unk> that &apos;s in this piece , and the <unk> .
i &apos;m a <unk> armstrong fan , so i &apos;m going to put on here , and i &apos;m going to show you all of you to show you in which <unk> armstrong was mentioned .
now , if i want to get a <unk> , i could think , &quot; ok , what if i look at all of you with the theme of <unk> ? &quot;
so i &apos;m going to go back to a step and <unk> the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get a idea that if you put on this kind of information , <unk> , larger , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , you don &apos;t understand or <unk> not just .
you do something that &apos;s actually a little different .
it &apos;s something in between , and we think it changes the way that information can be used .
i want to give this idea a little bit about what &apos;s a little bit crazy .
so what we &apos;ve done here is we &apos;ve got every single <unk> , and they &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to get a little <unk> .
the <unk> contains a short <unk> , and a symbol for the area that it comes from .
i &apos;m just going to show the top 500 of the <unk> .
but even in this <unk> , we can do a lot of things .
that &apos;s how we get a impression about the issues that are on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to choose the subject of government .
now , after the government , i know that the <unk> , i know that the <unk> , which is most of the time in the time that we are in the time of the year , &quot; people of the year . &quot;
this is really important , because this is an insight that &apos;s not in a single <unk> .
that &apos;s just to see if you go back to a step and look at the entire time .
<unk> on a certain of this <unk> , i can go to the theme of time , &quot; people of the year , &quot; i &apos;m going to see &quot; people &apos;s year , &quot; and all together .
now , if i look at all these people , i think that the majority of them are <unk> . some of them come from science . some people come from the economy . here &apos;s my boss , and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , bono is also a ted prize .
so we can look at this , and you can look at all of the ted prize orchestra .
you can see the first time in the web , the first time it &apos;s really a net , not only from side , not only from side , but a lot of abstract .
and so i want to show you something else that could be a little surprise .
i &apos;m going to show you just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser ; it &apos;s really not a browser , but you can see the <unk> to every single website like this .
so i can go back to a step back , and i &apos;m looking at a specific <unk> .
so this is important because you only think about the bottom of the websites in this way , and that &apos;s how we can see all the <unk> in the same way .
so , i can zoom in my <unk> in a certain time .
here &apos;s the whole demonstration of the entire demonstration that i &apos;ve been doing here .
and i can see everything that i &apos;ve looked at today , again , <unk> .
and then , when i go back to a step , and i &apos;m going to look at all of this , i can make my <unk> <unk> , and here , i &apos;m going to go back to <unk> <unk> , here , or here after life , and there &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
and from here , i can go to the side and put them back .
it &apos;s a metaphor that will be used again , and every time it makes the size bigger than the sum of the <unk> .
now , in this world , in this world , we think that data is a <unk> .
we talk about the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about &quot; drowning in information . &quot;
what if we could move this situation and put the internet on the head , so that we can go instead of looking for a lot of things to go from a lot of things to be able to go to a lot of things , and to see patterns that would only be <unk> ?
if we can do this , there will be <unk> , maybe a new source of <unk> information .
and , instead , instead of moving into information , we can get knowledge of it .
and if we know , if we know , we might even be able to use <unk> of it .
that &apos;s what i hear , thank you very much .
i grew up with a <unk> of science fiction .
in my school school , i went to the bus to school every day , every day a hour .
and my nose was always in a book , an <unk> , which is my thoughts in other worlds , and in the <unk> way , i was able to <unk> my very much in me , <unk> curiosity .
now , the curiosity showed you that i was always , if i was not in school , through the forests of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , frogs and pesticides and <unk> and <unk> , everything after home , and they went through the microscope .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was always about trying to understand the world , and the boundaries of the difference .
and my love to science fiction seemed to be in my own environment , because at the late &apos; 60s , in the late &apos; 60s , we went to the moon , and we &apos;ve done the current sea .
rick <unk> came in our living rooms with his fascinating shows that the animals and places , and a world full of wonders that we &apos;ve never seen before .
and that &apos;s really good to this <unk> <unk> .
and i was artists .
i could draw . i could draw .
and there &apos;s no video video games , and there &apos;s not the <unk> movies in the sun , and i had to create the images in my head , i had to create the images in my head .
that &apos;s what we had to do at the time . if we read as kids to read a book , we took the description of the <unk> and <unk> them on the screen in our head .
my response to that was the tongue and <unk> of <unk> , <unk> worlds , robots , <unk> and all of this .
in the <unk> , i was looking at the teachers from the teachers , as i was , sitting in the <unk> , <unk> .
the creativity had to go out of it .
and this is what happened interesting to me . what i found was <unk> <unk> <unk> , was the idea of a completely tragic world on the earth itself on our earth itself .
i would never be able to get a <unk> world with a <unk> world . it seemed pretty unlikely to me .
but here was a world that i was actually able to sit in here on the earth , and it was so fascinating and <unk> like all the things that i had learned when i read these books .
so i decided that when i was 15 , i was going to be <unk> .
the only problem was that i lived in a small village in canada , a half kilometers from the next ocean .
that &apos;s why i didn &apos;t leave myself .
i mean , my father , until he finally had a <unk> in <unk> , new york , just done , just on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> <unk> in the middle of the <unk> in the middle of the winter , new york .
but , in the ocean , a real ocean , i had only been to face two years later , when we moved to california .
since , in the 40 years , there are already <unk> , i &apos;ve spent about three hundred hours under water . 500 hours of it in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the world of the world , even in the <unk> oceans , as rich in <unk> lives , how we really don &apos;t think it &apos;s really rare .
the wisdom of nature doesn &apos;t know borders , in contrast to our own , <unk> human imagination .
for the time for today , i &apos;ve got the most extreme awe for what i see on my doha .
and my love to the ocean is the same intensity of the same intensity as ever as ever .
and as i asked myself as adults , it was <unk> , it was the <unk> .
this seemed the best opportunity to tell stories to tell stories to tell stories with my need to create images .
and as a kid , i went to <unk> , and this is how to do this .
so movies of the way , images and stories and narratives are building .
of course , the stories that i was <unk> , from the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
in &quot; <unk> , &quot; i was able to put my <unk> for the <unk> , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with the <unk> .
so , in fact , my two passions .
so what happened interesting happened in &quot; <unk> , &quot; to solve a <unk> problem in this film -- and that we had to create a kind of liquid <unk> that we &apos;ve had to create a kind of liquid animation , <unk> , back to <unk> .
what &apos;s going to come out was the first <unk> <unk> , who was ever going to see in a film .
and the film was not going to have a money , just told him , he was sitting in the same time , but i noticed something fascinating : the audience on the entire world was like <unk> of the magic , which was the <unk> of it .
he &apos;s the law <unk> of the law , <unk> technology and psychologists don &apos;t react to different of them .
so you saw something interesting .
and that &apos;s what i found was very exciting .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this has to be <unk> in the <unk> . &quot;
so we went into &quot; <unk> 2 , &quot; my next film , there &apos;s a lot further .
together , with <unk> , we created the guy from liquid metal , and the success was all about how this effect would be .
and it worked . again , we had done something bizarre , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we &apos;ve got a little bit more money .
from these two experiences , there was a whole new world , a very new world , a whole new world of creativity .
so i started a company , together with my good friend <unk> <unk> , who was the best <unk> and <unk> , and she was called &quot; digital <unk> . &quot;
so the idea of this company was to be able to be the phase of <unk> processes with visual emotions , and to look at the same with digital <unk> .
and we also did that , and then we &apos;ve got to have an <unk> .
but in the middle of the &apos; 90s , we discovered that we were in the <unk> and <unk> -- what we &apos;ve been doing was that we had a company , too slowly .
i had written this piece of &quot; the <unk> , &quot; which is called the <unk> in the things of visual effects and <unk> effects in the whole new <unk> , with <unk> of human beings , and the <unk> should all be <unk> . and the world should be <unk> .
but it was pretty back . and the people in my company told me that we were not able to be able to be able to be able to do this .
so i put this other film , and i made this other film about the big ship .
the <unk> , i &apos;ve got this as &quot; <unk> and <unk> on a ship , and it became <unk> . it became a <unk> <unk> brain , a <unk> film .
but in fact , i didn &apos;t want to be in the real <unk> of the titanic .
so i &apos;ve done the film .
that &apos;s the truth . the studio didn &apos;t know .
but i believe it &apos;s convinced i said , &quot; we go to the <unk> . we teach the real <unk> .
we &apos;re going to show it in the <unk> of the film .
this is incredibly important . it &apos;s a good <unk> for marketing . &quot;
and i forgot them to fund a expedition .
sounds crazy . but this is going to come back to the way that the own imagination can make a reality .
we actually created six months later a reality , where i was in a <unk> <unk> <unk> , four kilometers under the surface of the north east coast , and i got the real titanic through a <unk> .
this was not a film , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that &apos;s really what i really knew about .
and the process of it was enormous . we had to build cameras and <unk> and <unk> and all kinds of things .
and i was looking at how much this <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
you go into these rooms , and then you go into these dark , <unk> environment down , where no hope is going on , if you don &apos;t make it back to yourself .
and i thought , &quot; wow , that &apos;s the same thing that i was in a <unk> .
that &apos;s really cool . &quot;
i was obsessed with the study of the <unk> .
but from the part of the part that i mean with curiosity and science , it was all . it was a adventure , it was curiosity . it was imagination .
and it was a experience that could not give me hollywood .
because , you know , i was able to imagine a creature that we could make a visual effect , but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was going to see in the <unk> .
now , in some of the other , i &apos;ve seen creatures in <unk> , and sometimes things that i &apos;ve never seen before , sometimes things that i had ever seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before .
so that &apos;s really <unk> , and i wanted to do more .
and so i met a little bit unusual decision .
i said , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i said , &quot; okay , i want to put my <unk> as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i &apos;m going to <unk> for a while . &quot;
and then we started , we came to the <unk> , and we were thinking about <unk> .
we went back to the <unk> of the titanic .
we took little robots that we had built , which is a <unk> <unk> .
our intent was , <unk> , and to look at the skin of the ship , which was never done before .
no one had ever done the internal <unk> . you didn &apos;t have a need for that . so we &apos;ve developed the technology .
now , i &apos;m sitting here , on the nucleus of the titanic , in a <unk> , and see <unk> , which is pretty similar to this <unk> here , and i know that once i &apos;ve played the band there .
and i fly up with a little <unk> through the <unk> of the ship .
i think it &apos;s actually only , but my consciousness is within the vehicle .
and it felt like i was <unk> in the <unk> of the titanic .
this was the <unk> shape of a <unk> that i &apos;ve ever seen . because before i put a corner on a corner , i never knew what was going on in the <unk> of the vehicle , because i was going to come to the film , when we got the film .
so , the company was a very clear copy of the <unk> of the ship .
so this was a very strange experience .
it was aware of this <unk> that you can use to use such <unk> <unk> , and so your consciousness is in the vehicle , in those other form of existence .
it was really extraordinary .
and maybe a small thing about what might happen in some decades could happen if you could have <unk> , to explore something or other things , in all kinds of <unk> <unk> that i can imagine as a <unk> .
so , after this <unk> , we started to learn what we saw there was really afraid to learn , for example , this <unk> , where we looked at this incredibly amazing animals , and that &apos;s what we saw in the world .
they live with the help of <unk> .
they don &apos;t exist in one of sunlight , the way we do that .
and this is how you see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees centigrade that you can survive there .
and at the same time , i was very much interested in <unk> , and that was the <unk> of my childhood .
and so , i ended up with the people who are interested in space , and we &apos;re sitting in the <unk> , and they &apos;re sitting in the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to go to russia , and they &apos;re going to go back to the international <unk> of the mission , and then we take our <unk> to the international <unk> , and then we take our <unk> .
that was fascinating .
but at the end of the end , it was out that i took <unk> with us in the bottom .
i took them up and <unk> them to the world , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , people who are interested in such extreme situations , and i took them to the sources with that , so they were able to test tools and build tools and so forth .
we were <unk> , but it &apos;s actually science , and i actually said science , <unk> .
so the circle of the circle between my existence , as a child , and a child , and the <unk> in the reality .
and in the course of this research , i &apos;ve learned a lot of things .
i &apos;ve learned a lot about science , but i &apos;m thinking , you know , a director has to be able to make a leader , a leader like a <unk> or something .
but i didn &apos;t understand a lot of leadership before i did this <unk> .
because in a particular point , i had to say , &quot; what do i do here ?
why do i do that ? what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
these <unk> films are not going to give us a money .
now , we &apos;re going to play the size of a <unk> .
all of all , i was between &quot; titanic &quot; and &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i would have been able to <unk> the <unk> on a piece of the beach .
i &apos;ve all got these movies , these <unk> , for a very small audience .
no choice , no honor , no money , no money . what do you do ?
you &apos;re going to do it for the challenge of the challenge -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , and the ocean is the <unk> environment , and because of the strange connection that is , if a little group of people are doing a team of people .
because we &apos;ve done all this with 10 to 12 people who have been working for years , and sometimes we had two to three months , and sometimes we were two to three months in the lake .
and in this community , you realize that the most important thing is that the most important thing that you have on each other , because you have a challenge that you can &apos;t explain .
if you go back to land , and you say , &quot; we had to do it , the <unk> , the <unk> , and that &apos;s the same thing , the whole technology , and the trouble , the whole technology , and the issues that we &apos;re going to do is not explain the other thing , and that &apos;s how you can never explain that you can never explain somebody else .
there is a connection , which is <unk> respect .
so when i got to come back to my next film , and i tried to use the same <unk> , which is that you &apos;re going to <unk> his team , and that &apos;s going to <unk> their team .
it was really changing the dynamics .
so there i came back with a little team on <unk> terrain , and we were called &quot; <unk> , &quot; with a new technology that hasn &apos;t been there before .
it &apos;s exciting exciting .
a huge challenge .
and we &apos;ve been working for a half and a half years ago to a real family .
it changed my way to make movies , completely .
there were people who said , we would have had this <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re in the planet .
for me , there was more <unk> way to do my job , which is the real process that has changed in the result .
so what can we go from all of this ?
what lessons is we learned ?
i think , at first , the curiosity is the curiosity .
it &apos;s the most powerful human property .
our imagination is a force that can even create a reality .
and the <unk> of your team is important than all the <unk> of this world .
i &apos;m going to get young <unk> , who says , &quot; give me a advice like i can do something like i can do something like this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t <unk> yourself . &quot;
you &apos;ve got other other for you . don &apos;t do it yourself , you don &apos;t bet it against yourself , but take risks on you . &quot;
nasa has this <unk> : &quot; fail is not a alternative . &quot;
but in the art , and we need to explore fail to be a alternative , because there &apos;s a <unk> .
not a lot of <unk> , the innovation told that they had no risk of risk .
you need to be ready to take these risks .
that &apos;s the idea that i &apos;d like to give you with the way . fail is absolutely a alternative , fear , but it &apos;s not . thank you .
today , i &apos;m talking to you about energy and climate .
and that &apos;s surprising to me , because my <unk> on the foundation of most of vaccines and <unk> , the things that we need to invent and we need to have to create the poorest of two billion billion a better life .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , even more important than each other on the planet .
<unk> means that they &apos;re not going to be growing over many years . it &apos;s not going to be too much , and it &apos;s too much <unk> , and the things will be able to change how it can &apos;t change their <unk> environment .
that leads to <unk> . it leads to uncertainty . it leads to <unk> .
so , it &apos;s going to be horrible for them .
in fact , the <unk> is very important for them .
the fact is that if you could only get the price of one thing that &apos;s going to be able to reduce the price of the brain , to <unk> energy .
now , the <unk> is about time .
in fact , the <unk> of <unk> .
the <unk> was the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there was a <unk> case in the <unk> , and so we &apos;ve got <unk> , <unk> , we can create modern materials and so many things .
so we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we grow the price -- let &apos;s take the price down -- we &apos;re going to make a new barrier , and this unit depends on co2 with co2 .
it <unk> the planet , and the equation for co2 is actually pretty clear .
it <unk> the <unk> co2 , which leads to <unk> , and this <unk> has some very negative consequences . effects on the weather , and maybe worse , the <unk> of <unk> , that the natural ecosystems can &apos;t adapt to such the power of the change and the entire systems .
well , the most part of the relationship between a <unk> and which is <unk> <unk> and where their other consequences are there , there are some words , but not very many .
and there &apos;s sure of how bad these consequences are going to be , but they &apos;re going to be extremely bad !
i met the <unk> more than i said , &quot; do we really have to come down to near zero ?
isn &apos;t that half or a quarter ? &quot;
the answer is : until we come close to zero , the temperature is going to go down .
so it &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than to say , we have a half feet high trucks that has to get under one three feet of the bridge under a three feet of bridge .
this has to go back to the bottom , to zero .
now , we have a lot of <unk> , about 26 billion tons .
every americans about 20 tons . people from poor countries , less than one .
in average , it &apos;s about 5 tons for each other on the planet .
and somehow we have to create changes that we get to zero .
it &apos;s been done .
only different economic changes is changing it , and we need to go out of <unk> consumption , and we need to be in a bird , and you have to be in a <unk> to zero .
this equation has got four factors . a little bit <unk> . they have this thing on the left -- co2 -- that &apos;s what you want to get zero , and that &apos;s going to be <unk> by the number of people in average , the average energy for every service and the co2 , which is going to be <unk> .
so let &apos;s look at every factor of each other , and think about how we get to zero .
probably one of these numbers must come very close to zero .
now this is fundamental algebra , but we &apos;re going to go through it .
first of all , we &apos;ve got the population .
today , <unk> billion people .
and it &apos;s starting to move to nine billion <unk> to move on nine billion .
if we &apos;re very successful with new geometry , the <unk> and <unk> are , we might have to be about 10 percent to 15 percent , but we &apos;re going to see a drop of 1.3 .
the second factor is the services that we use .
this is all the food that we eat , clothing , tv , television , heat .
these are very good things , and <unk> means to make these services almost almost each other on the planet .
it &apos;s great that this number is open .
in the rich world , in the upper world , in the upper city , we might be able to make <unk> and fewer use , but in average , this number is going to come up every year , and so far more than <unk> , the number of services will be used per person .
here we see a very fundamental service . there &apos;s it to go back to home , so you can read the homework ?
and these students don &apos;t have it , so they go out and read their <unk> under the <unk> .
well , with efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there &apos;s a good news .
we have something that doesn &apos;t go down .
because of different successes in <unk> , through other <unk> , through new ways , through new ways in <unk> , there are a lot of services , their energy is going to reduce the energy to be killed by 90 percent .
in other service , like the power of <unk> , 65 squared : <unk> : <unk> : <unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> : <unk> : <unk> , or <unk> , is the <unk> of prosperity is very much small .
in fact , if we &apos;re optimistic , we might get a <unk> to a factor of three or maybe even a factor of six feet .
but in the first three factors , we &apos;re now <unk> about 26 billion feet , and it doesn &apos;t just get <unk> billion tons , and that &apos;s just not enough .
so let &apos;s see the fourth factor of -- and this is going to be a key thing -- that &apos;s the amount of co2 , that &apos;s the amount of co2 that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
it turns out the question that you can get to zero .
if you burn coal : no .
if you burn natural gas : no .
almost almost every <unk> for electricity is the co2 , except the renewables of energy and <unk> .
so what we need to do on a global level is to create a new system .
we need <unk> .
now , if i use the term &quot; wonders , &quot; i don &apos;t mean the impossible .
the <unk> is a miracle . the <unk> is a miracle .
the internet and its health is a miracle .
the people here have been able to get many of these wonders in the development of many of these wonders .
now , there &apos;s no doubt that you need to have a miracle to get a miracle to a particular place .
even if you look at it only , and some of them are not going to be there .
but in this case , we have to give <unk> , and a miracle in a very short time .
well , i asked myself , how can i really do that ?
is there a natural <unk> , a demonstration that &apos;s the idea of the people here ?
i remembered the last year when i took online , and i was kind of wondering the people .
the idea was really <unk> , you know that there are people who are living with mosquitoes .
for energy , i was doing this one .
and i decided that this is the beginning of <unk> to the environment that would be here .
so here are a couple of natural <unk> .
and i said that they didn &apos;t buy . in fact , they &apos;re not going to get the glass .
well , there are all sorts of <unk> like this , but they &apos;re not going to use a lot .
we need solutions , either one or a few of the things that have a <unk> , and we &apos;ve got a lot of directions , and even though there are many directions where people are looking at , i really see five things that can afford these big players .
i &apos;ve got <unk> , <unk> , design and <unk> .
now , you might be able to reach a <unk> , and if you think better than i expect , that &apos;s great , but my <unk> here is that we have to work on all these five , and we can &apos;t give them out because they &apos;re <unk> , because all of us have big problems .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> of fossil fuels by either coal or natural gas .
what you need to do there is maybe easy , but that &apos;s not . you have to have to do this . you &apos;ve got to use all the co2 that comes out of the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and i hope that it &apos;s going to go there .
there are a couple of <unk> , which is a 60 percent -- 80 percent level , but it &apos;s going to get to 100 percent <unk> , but it &apos;s going to be very difficult to get the <unk> of co2 , which is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
what is it going to do ?
what can prove something that literally are different billion times bigger than any kind of garbage that you can imagine from <unk> and other things ?
this is a lot of agreement .
so this is a hard thing .
next : <unk> .
they also have three big problems . the cost of all in <unk> countries are high , and the question for security is that you really feel that nothing wrong can go wrong , despite the human service that the fuel is not used for weapons .
and what do you do with the garbage ?
because even though it &apos;s not very big , there &apos;s a lot of assumptions .
so three very hard problems that might be possible , and that &apos;s why you should work with it .
the last three of the five things i &apos;ve done .
it &apos;s the renewables of how they &apos;re going to be called .
and they also have -- although it &apos;s great that you don &apos;t need your fuel -- you &apos;ve got some <unk> .
one is the <unk> that these technologies can produce dramatically more than the <unk> of <unk> .
these are <unk> , you &apos;re talking about many <unk> , 1,000 times than a normal power .
there is <unk> of these sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t seem the entire day , it doesn &apos;t seem to be all day , and so the wind is not all the time .
so you have to think , if you think about these sources , a way to have a way to get the energy even in times when they &apos;re not available .
so there &apos;s huge <unk> . there are challenges in the <unk> , if we tell example that the energy energy is in the country , they don &apos;t need to be the technology , they also need to deal with the risks that the energy is different from where it &apos;s different from the way .
and there &apos;s the <unk> .
and in order to show the dimension , i have all sorts of batteries , which will be made , looked at the way of cars , computers , mobile phones , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for everything , and i found that all the batteries that we could now use to grow less than 10 minutes of the <unk> .
so , we need a big breakthrough , something that &apos;s about a factor 100 better than the amount of time .
that &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not so easy .
that &apos;s what happens when you &apos;re trying to get these <unk> sources of people to tell about 20 percent -- 30 percent of the world .
if you want to invest 100 percent of it , you need a incredible <unk> .
now , where are we going to go , what &apos;s the right approach ?
a &quot; manhattan project , &quot; how do we come to the goal ?
what we need is many companies that are working on it . hundreds .
in every one of these five areas , we need to be at least 100 people .
in many of you , you &apos;re going to say , these are crazy ! that &apos;s good .
i think here in the ted group , there &apos;s a lot of things that exist there .
bill number has multiple companies , under other ways , one called <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> are living in dozens of dozens of companies to make the great stuff and interesting possibilities and i try to support that .
nathan nathan , and i &apos;ve met a company , which is , maybe surprisingly , the nuclear approach is <unk> .
there are some innovations in the <unk> ; <unk> , liquid .
so , in this industry , in this industry , a couple of time ago , it &apos;s not a big surprise that a few good concepts , and it &apos;s not a big surprise that some good concepts .
the <unk> means that , instead of a part of the <unk> , the one percent , the <unk> , we decided to burn the 99 percent , the <unk> .
this is a pretty strange idea .
but in fact , you &apos;ve been thinking about a long time , but you could never calculate whether it would work , but we could never calculate if there was modern <unk> , you can simulate it and see that , yeah .
and because you get this 99 percent , the <unk> is very much better .
in fact , you can use the garbage , and you can even use the waste of today , as a <unk> .
instead of putting the head of the head , they &apos;re just going to burn it . a great thing .
the <unk> is used to be <unk> , a little bit like a candle .
you can see that it &apos;s kind of <unk> , often as a <unk> wave .
it really doesn &apos;t change the <unk> .
here &apos;s a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you &apos;ve got the part that &apos;s going to be <unk> today , so it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you get <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet .
you know , there &apos;s a lot of challenges there , but it &apos;s a example of many hundreds of ideas that we need to get forward .
let &apos;s think about how we should measure our success .
how should we look at our <unk> ?
well , we &apos;re going to go to the goal that we need to do , and then we talk about the <unk> .
many of the talk about one 80 percent reduction to 2050 .
it &apos;s really very important that we get there .
the rest of 20 percent will be created in poor countries , and they &apos;re still a little bit of agriculture , and i &apos;m not going to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
so , to get these 80 percent , the developing countries , including countries like china , their <unk> are completely <unk> .
the other cartoon says if we use the <unk> technology , whether it &apos;s used in all developed countries , and we &apos;re on the way to get it to the way to get them to the rest .
that &apos;s great important .
this is going to be a key part of this <unk> .
if we go back from there , how should we look at 2020 ?
it should have come back to the two elements .
we should use the <unk> to bring 70 to the way . the less we &apos;re going to be <unk> , the less we &apos;re going to be <unk> , and that &apos;s also the temperature .
but in fact , this clip is the things that we have companies that are not completely <unk> to the big <unk> , just the same thing , or even something less important as the other , which is the <unk> of innovation for this breakthroughs .
this threshold we need to follow with <unk> , and we can measure that , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books in this topic .
al gore &apos;s book , &quot; we have a choice , &quot; and david <unk> , &quot; <unk> energy <unk> of the <unk> air . &quot;
they &apos;re going to get it through and create a level where this is going to be <unk> , because we need to support for all sides .
there &apos;s a couple of things that has to come together .
that &apos;s a wish .
a very small wish that we need to invent this technology .
now , if you &apos;re only a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a vaccine , and i love this wish , or i could choose this wish , which is , <unk> <unk> without co2 , and that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do .
this has the biggest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , you &apos;re going to make the <unk> between the present between the united states , between the united states and china , between poor and rich , between poor , and almost all the lives of these two billion billions are going to be very much worse .
so what do we need to do ?
so , what do i do ?
we need to use us for more <unk> .
if countries go into places like <unk> , they should not only talk about co2 .
they should end up these <unk> , and they would be shocked by the <unk> small <unk> that are going to be spent for these innovative ways .
we need <unk> , co2 vessels , <unk> &amp; amp ; we need something called <unk> .
we need to spread the news .
we need to make dialogue <unk> and <unk> , and also the things that are going to be done from the government .
it &apos;s a important wish , but i think we can do it .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you very much . only to understand a little bit better -- first , can you give us an idea of the scale of this investment ?
bill gates : to get the simulation on a <unk> , all big scientists , which we &apos;ve done , we only need to have a few 10 million . and even if we &apos;ve spent our materials in a russian field , to make sure that it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s only in the <unk> million .
so the hard step is that we &apos;re building the first <unk> to find more billion , the <unk> and the place that actually make the first of them .
once the first thing is , if it goes like , it &apos;s very clear , because it &apos;s very clear , because the amount of <unk> that is so different than <unk> , how we know them .
to try to understand this : that means deep in the ground , almost like a vertical <unk> <unk> , this use <unk> , and then it starts on the process , and then the process starts on the bottom , and we &apos;re going to go back to the bottom line ?
<unk> : right . so today , you &apos;ve got to be able to do the <unk> , so there are many people and many voices that can go wrong , and this thing that you can open it up , and that thing is <unk> , and that &apos;s not good .
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can think of it for 60 years -- think of a <unk> -- that you put it down , without the entire <unk> .
and it &apos;s sitting there , and there &apos;s 60 years long , and then it &apos;s done .
a <unk> , which is a solution for the garbage .
<unk> : yeah . now , what &apos;s happening with the garbage : you can sit on it -- there &apos;s a lot of less garbage with this method -- then you take him and put it into the next one , and you &apos;re going to burn it into the next one and use it .
and we start by using the garbage that already exists in this <unk> or <unk> in the audience , and this is our <unk> .
so that &apos;s what &apos;s a problem for these reactors , which is what we &apos;re going to do in our <unk> and that will be dramatic <unk> during this process .
but while you &apos;ve talked to different people in this world , you &apos;ve talked about these possibilities .
where is the biggest interest , what &apos;s really going to do ?
<unk> : well , we don &apos;t have a place on a place , and there &apos;s a lot of more interesting <unk> for everything that is called &quot; nuclear &quot; in the name . there are big interest and the people of the company was in russia , india , china -- i was talking about how this is called the <unk> .
i &apos;m optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done something in the direction .
this is a measure of one thing that was done .
and this is an important step forward , but it &apos;s like a faster <unk> and some countries have built this built , so everyone who has done a quick field , a <unk> for our first .
in your view , <unk> and probability of the way that something really was going to be in the life ?
<unk> : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very productive , we have 20 years to invent , and then we have 20 years .
this is basically the <unk> that we need to be able to use the <unk> that we need to do .
and , you know , <unk> , if all right up , and that &apos;s a big wish , it could be easy .
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people who are working on the same way that they &apos;re working for their child , which is going to be <unk> for their lungs .
and it would be the best , if there &apos;s several ways , because then you could use a mixture .
at every case , we need a solution .
of the great kind of breakthroughs , is this the biggest thing you know ?
<unk> : a <unk> is the most important thing .
that would be , without the <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t make it much more important .
in the nuclear sector , there are other innovative companies .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as this , but there &apos;s the antidote to that , but there &apos;s the <unk> method , which is another approach .
there &apos;s a liquid <unk> that seems to be something hard , but maybe you say that &apos;s about us .
and so , there are different , but the beautiful thing about this is that there &apos;s a million times a million times as much energy , like one , say , a <unk> , and therefore , if you can deal with the problems , the implications of the country , and other things , almost in a way , is the implications of the country and other things , almost in a <unk> .
if that &apos;s not going to do that , what ?
are we going to be <unk> , to try to be able to keep the <unk> .
<unk> : if you &apos;re in this situation , it &apos;s as if you eat too much , and it &apos;s about a heart of a heart , and it &apos;s about a heart attack , which is what you do ? you might need a <unk> or something like this .
and there &apos;s a <unk> that &apos;s called <unk> , which is called different techniques to <unk> the warming , so we &apos;re going to get 20 or 30 years longer for us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
we hope we don &apos;t need that .
some people say , you don &apos;t want to work on insurance , because you might be able to be happy , so you &apos;re going to survive because you know that you &apos;re going to save the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know if you &apos;re the importance of this problem , but there &apos;s a depression in <unk> about whether you should have been able to be able to have to be more , if things are faster , or that innovation needs better than we expect to be more , or that innovation needs better than we expect .
<unk> : do you have one or two sentences for you to convince you ?
<unk> : well , unfortunately , the <unk> in a very different wall .
those who are doing scientific arguments are very little .
do you know that there are negative implications that have to do with the clouds that are changing the things ?
there are very , very few things that you can tell at all that there are a chance in a million .
the <unk> here is so similar to aids .
you make the mistakes now , and you &apos;re going to pay for a lot later .
and so the idea is , now , if you have all sorts of <unk> problems to invest in something that you only have -- and it comes out that the investment is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world , and there are people in the rich world , and you can say , okay , this is not a big drama .
the fact is that these uncertainty should make us worry .
but my dream here is that if you can make it economic , and then the co2 is going to say , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t think that it is , &quot; okay , i don &apos;t think that it is , but i &apos;m going to accept it , because it &apos;s cheaper than the previous method . &quot;
and that would be their answer to the <unk> <unk> argument that if you use all of these time and energy to solve the co2 &apos;s problem , all the other goals are <unk> by malaria and so forth that there is a stupid waste of resources to invest , while there are better things that we can do .
<unk> : well , the real time for the research -- say , we should spend u.s. billion dollars a year than they &apos;re doing today -- that &apos;s not so dramatic .
in fact , other things aren &apos;t suffering .
and then you &apos;re going to get a lot of <unk> , and here can be <unk> people , if you have something that is not natural , and trying to fund that . for me , the most dangerous waste .
it &apos;s because you &apos;re very short about a <unk> , and that &apos;s only the <unk> , and i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you &apos;re going to get a very high <unk> , and then you can only get the rich <unk> .
i mean , every one of us here could spend five times so much for our energy to change their brain .
for the bottom two billion , but it &apos;s a disaster .
and even <unk> think about it .
his new <unk> is now : &quot; why is not going to talk about this research ? &quot;
he &apos;s still going to be there , because of his early stories , with the <unk> , but he understood that this is a very hot group , and therefore he &apos;s going to do it now .
and this is a miracle that i think is <unk> .
the research , it &apos;s just crazy , how little that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
bill , i think i &apos;m talking for almost all the people here , if i say , i really hope you &apos;re going to be true . thank you very much .
<unk> : thank you .
a couple of years ago , here at ted , peter <unk> <unk> a <unk> called &quot; the <unk> . &quot;
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> , the most important <unk> structure with 20 games , about 20 games , about a thousand <unk> , about a <unk> , and we &apos;re building a marshmallow .
the sound has to be on top of it .
and , although it &apos;s really easy , it &apos;s really hard to work because it &apos;s really hard to work .
and so i thought this is a interesting idea , and i was able to get it into a <unk> .
it was a huge success .
since , i &apos;ve done about 70 languages in the world , with students , <unk> and architects , even with <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s something on this task , which brings deep <unk> in the nature of collaboration , and i want to share some of them with them .
normally , most people are going to take care of themselves about the task .
they talk about it , you &apos;re thinking about how it &apos;s going to look at it .
then you invest a little time in sex and organization , and they <unk> them , and they <unk> <unk> .
they invest a lot of their time in the <unk> and <unk> structures .
and finally , just before they don &apos;t have a time , someone takes the marshmallow , and they put it back to the top , and they &apos;re going to go back to the top , and then a step back , &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> your work .
but what i think almost always happened is that the &quot; <unk> &quot; is going to be called &quot; <unk> , &quot; because the weight of the <unk> is that the whole thing is <unk> and <unk> .
there are a series of people who are much more like &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> than other , and under the worst are <unk> .
she thinks they don &apos;t seem , they &apos;re confused and produce really <unk> .
and of course , there &apos;s a lot of teams that are much more called <unk> <unk> , and under the best hand , <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s pretty amazing .
as we said peter said not only the highest towers , but also the most interesting structure of all .
what you might ask is : how does this ? why ? what about those ? why ?
and peter said , &quot; none of the children spend time to be <unk> . &quot;
they don &apos;t invest time in <unk> .
but there &apos;s another reason .
and that is that <unk> were <unk> to find a right plan , ok .
and it turns out to realize it .
what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you don &apos;t have time more and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sounds familiar , what ?
what <unk> different is that they &apos;re starting to start with the marshmallow and prototype prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so they &apos;re going to create the opportunity to repair <unk> prototypes .
<unk> can see this kind of collaboration as the core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every time , the children are going to get the feedback of what &apos;s going to work , and what doesn &apos;t .
so the performance is to work with prototypes , a lot of -- but let &apos;s see how different teams are connected .
the average of most of them is in about <unk> , <unk> that half of them , lawyers have a little bit more , but not much , <unk> are better than adults .
who &apos;s the most successful ?
architects and engineers , to happiness .
six is the highest thing i &apos;ve seen .
and why ? because they understand it and <unk> <unk> patterns are the key to build <unk> structures .
<unk> is something about average . but here &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be interesting .
if you put a <unk> <unk> on the team , they will be different better .
it &apos;s incredible . they &apos;re looking at and see , &quot; this team is going to win . &quot;
you can see the predictions . why is that ?
because they have special skills of <unk> .
they <unk> the process , they understand him .
and this team that <unk> and on the work is going to look at the performance of the team of the team .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination to success .
if you have 10 teams , you &apos;ve got about six , you get about six , the <unk> structure .
i tried to do something interesting .
i thought we &apos;re going to bring the <unk> right now .
so i had a <unk> dollars for software for the neocortex .
what do you think about this <unk> ?
what was the result ?
this happened here . not a team had a <unk> structure .
if somebody had been built a <unk> high , he would have had the price to go home .
so is it not interesting that high <unk> has a strong effect ?
we <unk> these practice with the same students .
what do you think happened ?
now , they understood the advantage of the business .
that was from the same , bad team of one under the best .
they used the highest system in the same time .
so there are <unk> lessons to us about nature and success .
they like to ask , why would someone actually invest time to create a <unk> ?
the reason is i make digital tools and processes to help tests to help teams , cars , video games and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and what the <unk> does is to identify them to identify the <unk> assumptions .
because open said , every project has his own marshmallow .
the challenge is a common experience , a common language or <unk> to build the right prototype .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so simple motivation .
and those of you who are interested in , you can visit <unk> .
it &apos;s a blog where you can see how to build the <unk> .
there &apos;s a <unk> there .
they find crazy examples of all the world , like people <unk> the system and <unk> .
there are also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i believe , is actually a <unk> <unk> .
it takes us all of our senses on the task , and that we use our thinking that we use our thinking , how our feelings and our work , in the challenge that we are .
and sometimes a small prototype of this experience is all that it takes us from a &quot; <unk> &quot; -- to get a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and that can make a big difference .
thank you .
let &apos;s do that as we had a machine here .
a big machine , a cool machine , <unk> machine , and that &apos;s a <unk> .
and everyone in this room has to do in this room .
and you can go to the past , you can go into the future , you can &apos;t go in the future , right now .
and i ask myself what they would choose because i &apos;ve got to ask my friends in the last time , and they wanted to go to the past .
i don &apos;t know . they wanted to go back to the time before there were cars or twitter or &quot; america &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that you are kind of <unk> to <unk> .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of this group , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to do in the past , and not because i &apos;m a <unk> .
it &apos;s because we don &apos;t go back to this planet , they &apos;re going to go back to this planet .
so i want to go into this machine , and i want to go into the future .
this is the biggest time that we &apos;ve ever been on this planet , not , which is what the scale you &apos;re doing : health , transparency , mobility , opportunities .
there never had been a time before this .
my <unk> died all died as they were 60 .
my grandparents asked this number on <unk> .
my parents are the 80 on the <unk> .
so there was better a nine at the beginning of my <unk> .
but it &apos;s not about people like us , because this is a greater thing than that .
so a kid that &apos;s born today in new zealand can expect to live as much as the richest man in the world over 100 years ago .
think about it . this is an incredible fact .
and why is that ?
smallpox . the smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
they &apos;ve done the <unk> of earth on a way that it doesn &apos;t have war , as it doesn &apos;t have war .
they &apos;re gone . they &apos;re gone .
we &apos;ve <unk> them . <unk> .
in the rich world exists , the million of us exist only a bunch of a generation , hardly only a generation , hardly yet .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
did anybody even know what this is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , these are <unk> of the scientific method .
and from my view , the scientific method is to try and look at if it works , it doesn &apos;t change , if it doesn &apos;t do it , one of the most important well-being of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s the whole good news , because there are some other problems , and they were often mentioned .
and one of them is that , despite all of our well-being have a billion people on this world every day .
this number goes down , and they &apos;re going to go very quickly , and that &apos;s funny .
and not only that , we &apos;ve been used our imagination to draw this world .
<unk> , <unk> land , beijing , oil , gas : they disappear , and that &apos;s soon , and if we don &apos;t care about this chaos , we &apos;re doing it .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can produce food that will feed billions of people , without the country that they live in .
i think we can use this world with energy that they didn &apos;t end up the same time .
i think that &apos;s really , and no , that &apos;s not a <unk> .
but this is where i read at night -- one of the things that night me at night , we &apos;ve never needed scientific progress as well as well , never needed the same thing as well .
and we &apos;ve never been able to be able to be able to be able to make it <unk> , like we can do it today .
we &apos;re interested in the <unk> , amazing events on many areas , and yet i really think that we &apos;ve got hundreds of thousands of years ago to find a time to find a time that we have to go back to a time in which we &apos;ve been able to get out of these things , in which we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to get out of these things .
the people <unk> in their belief , and that &apos;s so cute that you can &apos;t turn them .
not even the truth is going to use it .
and you hear , every one has a right thing on his opinion , even a right thing on his opinion of progress .
but you know what you don &apos;t have right ?
they don &apos;t have right on their own facts . <unk> , they don &apos;t have .
and i needed a long time to figure out that .
about about a decade ago , i had a article about <unk> for the new yorker , a little article .
and i was amazed by training , in the <unk> , on the <unk> , which is the most important idea in health care of humanity in the history of humanity .
i didn &apos;t know what i should do , so i didn &apos;t even do what i did , i wrote a article , and i went off .
and soon , i was writing a article about <unk> wealth .
the same thing , only bigger .
people would be mad .
so , i was written about a article , and i couldn &apos;t understand why the people thought this would be &quot; <unk> , &quot; why they thought molecules on a particular rather than a little bit of a little bit of <unk> a <unk> in the area of nature .
but you know , i &apos;m doing what i do . i wrote the article , i went back .
i mean , i am journalist .
we show , we &apos;re able to eat , we &apos;re eating food , that &apos;s okay .
but this article taught me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , why , and finally , i found it out .
and this is because these <unk> , i didn &apos;t have been <unk> , i didn &apos;t have been <unk> at all of all of us .
these were <unk> people , <unk> people , <unk> people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and this led me to me .
but then i thought , you know what , we know .
we &apos;re in a point where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to change the same relationship as well as before .
we talk about it .
we &apos;re talking about this , with small <unk> of this : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , this is the reasons , and i think we know what the reason is .
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes the science is lost , and there &apos;s no reason why it should not be that way .
you can just call a couple of names and people will understand .
<unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list .
there are questions and problems with people who we thought they were always right . so they &apos;re <unk> .
you ask questions , ask the evidence , trust evidence .
if you don &apos;t have a <unk> .
but now , when you get evidence , you have to imagine this evidence , and we &apos;re not good .
and i can tell this out of the reason that we &apos;re now in a epidemic of fear life , as i never saw them , and hopefully never see again .
about 12 years ago , a story was published a story , a terrible story , which is the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine in connection .
very scary .
many studies have been done to see if this was true .
many studies should be done ; that &apos;s a serious thing .
the data came in .
the data came in from the united states , from sweden , from sweden , from sweden , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no connection , not .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference . it doesn &apos;t make any difference because we think about ddt , we believe what we see , we think we &apos;re really happy to see what we really feel .
we don &apos;t think of a <unk> documents of a <unk> that gives us data , and i understand that i think we &apos;re all doing .
but you know what ?
and the result of this was more powerful .
and because of this fact : the united states is one of the only countries on the world where the <unk> <unk> is <unk> .
this is <unk> , and we should make ourselves .
it &apos;s terrible .
what happens is that we could do this .
well , i understand that . this is what i do .
because has someone written here ?
have a single one in the audience ever see someone who are going to die ?
in fact , it &apos;s not very often .
in this country , i don &apos;t even have this country , but <unk> time on the world in the last year .
these are a lot of death through <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because this is not happening here , we can <unk> it , and people like <unk> <unk> can go back and think of fear and <unk> of sadness like oprah and larry king live .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t connect the cause and danger .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem to be the same thing , but almost never the same .
and this is something that we need to learn , and that &apos;s very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas <unk> .
he <unk> us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
no fear , no <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , disappeared .
the guy in the middle of the middle is not so much .
he &apos;s called paul <unk> .
he just evolved with a couple of other people who evolved a <unk> .
it can save the life of <unk> , 26 children per year in the developing world .
pretty good , isn &apos;t it ?
well , this is good , except that paul <unk> , and it says about vaccines , and he says , how valuable they are , and that people should just stop .
and this is what he says .
paul is a quarter .
when paul <unk> in a public <unk> , he doesn &apos;t see it without <unk> .
he &apos;s going to go home , because people like to tell him that they know where their children go to school .
and why ? because paul has done a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say , but vaccines are serious .
take them down , and you &apos;re going back to the diseases , horrible diseases , and that &apos;s what happens .
we &apos;ve done in this country now .
and this is going to be worse , and pretty soon , children will die on it , because this is just a question of numbers .
and they &apos;re not only going to die of <unk> .
what about <unk> ? let &apos;s take this . why don &apos;t we ?
and one of me was written by me a couple of weeks ago , and i said , i said , i &apos;m a little bit to <unk> .
no one never said before .
she wouldn &apos;t <unk> their child against <unk> . no , no case .
okay .
why ? because we don &apos;t have <unk> . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have <unk> in this country .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe you &apos;ve been in lagos . i &apos;m sitting in lagos in a plane , and you &apos;re sitting on los angeles , in the moment , it &apos;s about ohio .
and in a couple of hours , he goes and <unk> a car , and he comes back to long beach , and he &apos;s going to get one of these <unk> <unk> .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a <unk> disease , and we don &apos;t know that , because this is how the world works .
this is the planet that we live . don &apos;t do it as if it &apos;s not .
we love it to <unk> us . we love that .
are you all over the morning today ?
<unk> <unk> , a little <unk> that helps them to use them .
i know that you &apos;ve done this , because half of americans are doing that every day .
they take the stuff , and they take visual cure , and it doesn &apos;t make a difference , as often we find out that they &apos;re impossible .
the data shows that all of this stuff .
they grow their offspring . more , they &apos;re never going to do it .
this is okay , you want to give 28 billion dollars for dark watts .
i &apos;m going to tell you very much .
dark bird . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do this ?
well , i think i understand -- we hate the <unk> .
we hate a very strong government . we don &apos;t have trust in the system .
and that &apos;s not what we should do . our health care is <unk> .
it &apos;s cruel to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely amazing cold and <unk> itself to make it .
so we &apos;re going to walk before , and where are we going to go ?
we &apos;re going to go to the poor of the <unk> .
that &apos;s great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , this is really a serious thing , because the stuff is grateful , and we spend billions of dollars for that .
and i have all sorts of small <unk> here .
no one -- <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t even know what that is , but we give billions billion dollars for it .
and you know what ? if i say this , i &apos;m going to tell you the people and say , &quot; what do you want to do ? let &apos;s do what you want to do .
so you feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? they &apos;re wrong .
because it doesn &apos;t matter whether it &apos;s the <unk> , who says , &quot; hmm , i &apos;m not going to stop the evidence of my experts , &quot; or any <unk> , who wants to treat his patient with <unk> .
if you look at this way , where think and magic evidence and magic evidence , they get into a place where they don &apos;t want to be .
they get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he took 30,000 of his people , because he was to be that the red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are much more effective than <unk> drugs that we know that they can see the <unk> of aids .
hundreds of <unk> death in a country that will be worse than every other of this disease .
don &apos;t tell me that these things don &apos;t have consequences .
they have them . they &apos;ve always got them .
now , the <unk> epidemic that we &apos;re on here is this book of life between the <unk> <unk> of <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . it &apos;s got to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about design .
this is ideology , not science .
all of what we eat , every <unk> , every branch , every branch , all <unk> , was changed by people .
you know , there was no <unk> in the skull .
there was no <unk> .
there was no <unk> . we &apos;ve done it all done .
we &apos;ve done it in the last hundred years .
and some of them has done , and some of them doesn &apos;t work .
we &apos;re <unk> , which doesn &apos;t work .
now , we can make it closer . and of course , there are risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people to get their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do it ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand .
we &apos;ve been able to <unk> food .
why do we do this ?
now , what i &apos;m going to hear is : to many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , creatures , <unk> , we don &apos;t want huge fields with one thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t want companies to patent lives .
we don &apos;t want companies to have companies .
and you know what my answer to all this is ?
yes , they &apos;re right . we &apos;re doing this .
it &apos;s true , we have a huge <unk> , but that &apos;s not science .
that has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s right , morality , <unk> .
you know that science is not a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not a idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works , and sometimes it doesn &apos;t work , but the idea that we should not allow science to do is to do their work because we &apos;re afraid to do this , and it &apos;s about millions of people from <unk> .
you know , in the next 50 years , we &apos;re going to use 70 percent more food than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
funny . <unk> .
they need that , and we don &apos;t give them .
and why ? <unk> changed food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat this <unk> stuff , like for example .
it &apos;s something that &apos;s about half a billion people to eat .
it &apos;s about like a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a <unk> calories . it &apos;s <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t have food , it doesn &apos;t have the protein , and scientists are doing all this .
and then people could eat the food , and they wouldn &apos;t be blind .
you wouldn &apos;t survive , and you know what ?
that would be beautiful . it wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , but it would be beautiful .
and everything i can tell you is : why do we fight this ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask you , why do we fight this ?
because we don &apos;t want to <unk> genes ?
it &apos;s not about that , gene <unk> . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our <unk> to greater food , better food , <unk> food .
it &apos;s not about <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s about to get people in life , and it becomes the highest time to understand what that means .
because do you know what ?
if we don &apos;t do that , if we &apos;re going to do that , we &apos;re going to do something like that , we don &apos;t think i don &apos;t want to be guilty about it , i think i don &apos;t want to be guilty .
there &apos;s no other description for what happens here .
it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s ugly , it &apos;s not <unk> , and we need to do that .
so after this incredibly funny entertainment entertainment , you might say , &quot; don &apos;t you want to be able to go into that ridiculous , and i &apos;m going to go to the future ? &quot;
at every case , i want to go on every case .
in the moment , it &apos;s in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can see this time on all of what we want .
we can put them out where we want to <unk> them , and we &apos;re going to move them there , where we want to do .
we need to make these conversations , and we need to think , but if we go into the world , and we &apos;re going to go back to the future , we &apos;re going to be happy to have done .
i know that we can do it , and as far as i think that &apos;s what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
so for a couple of time , i &apos;m interested in <unk> . it may seem strange that a magician is interested in this , it &apos;s because they look at it like , as &quot; a deception that is going to be true to something that &apos;s going to be true , if someone is just clear enough to think about it . &quot;
in other words , <unk> has shown in some studies , the <unk> system , and that &apos;s just because the person thinks that the person think of what happens to you , is a <unk> or a kind of ... in the <unk> , for example , if the patient &apos;s only realized it &apos;s called an <unk> effect in the body that you call the <unk> .
it will be deception to something like this , because somebody &apos;s going to be like this .
so let &apos;s try to understand each other , so i want to show you a fundamental thing to show pretty simple .
and i &apos;m going to show you how he works . this is a trick that &apos;s going to be a trick at least since the 1950s for kids .
i learned him from the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the 1970s .
i &apos;m going to do it for them and explain it .
and then i &apos;m going to explain why i &apos;ll explain him .
so you see what happens .
the knife that you can study ; my hand that you can explore .
i &apos;m going to get the knife just like this in my <unk> .
i put my <unk> back .
and to make sure there &apos;s nothing in my <unk> , or out of him , i &apos;m just going to get my wrist right here right here .
and in this way , you can see that you &apos;re going to see anything , as long as i &apos;m doing here , it can &apos;t be able to do anything in my <unk> , or you can &apos;t get it into my <unk> .
and the goal is just easy .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all this is going to be good , it &apos;s going to <unk> the knife by my <unk> .
in fact , in fact , it looks like that i can shake it , without that the knife .
nothing else in my <unk> or comes out , no <unk> , and you can study everything .
<unk> !
now , this is a trick that i often ask little children who are interested in magic , because you can learn very much about deception if you look at it , even though it &apos;s a very simple <unk> trick .
you know many of you here in the room of this trick .
he &apos;s working on this .
i think the knife in my hand .
i say that i <unk> my wrist to make sure that nothing in my <unk> leaves or left , and that &apos;s a <unk> .
the reason i think i <unk> my wrist is that it &apos;s the real secret of illusion .
in the moment , where i mean , my hand from you in the back of them , you &apos;re looking at it from the back , this fingers here , my <unk> , just from there , where he was , in a position where he was so <unk> .
great trick ?
in the back , someone in the right is someone who had a childhood .
so , it &apos;s right here .
and if i <unk> myself , the fingers is going to be the position .
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don &apos;t realize that here &apos;s just three fingers : because the mind and the way that it &apos;s the way that it &apos;s the way that it doesn &apos;t depend on , one , two , three , but she sees them as a group .
but this is actually not happening here . and then i get my hand .
of course , it &apos;s going to <unk> , but not by the <unk> of my body , but through a trick , by my <unk> , which is now there .
and if i look at my hand , this is the same thing that i &apos;m going to do is <unk> by this movement , that the fingers are <unk> .
i take this hand out . and here &apos;s the knife .
this trick can show their friends and neighbors . thank you .
well , what does that have to do with the <unk> ?
a year ago , a year ago , i read a study that was really true .
i &apos;m not a doctor or researchers , and that &apos;s why i was an amazing thing for me .
and it turns out that , if you put up a <unk> in form of a white pill , in the form of a <unk> , it &apos;s just a round , white pill , which is just a particular <unk> effect .
but if you look at the shape that you &apos;re going to use the <unk> , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue <unk> and a letter on this , it &apos;s actually <unk> more effective .
and that , although no one of the <unk> -- it &apos;s just <unk> .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that was really surprised me .
it turns out that it &apos;s not all the time .
if you take <unk> , it &apos;s even more effective than <unk> every form .
a <unk> <unk> , which is on one end , and on the other red , is better than a white <unk> .
but the <unk> is a role .
a pill twice is not as good as three pills -- i don &apos;t want me to remember the real statistics . i &apos;m sorry .
but the key thing is , right ?
stories also play a role of a role .
and the shape is a role .
and if you want to have the ultimate <unk> , you have to get to the needle .
right ? a <unk> with a <unk> -- a couple of <unk> of a <unk> substance that you &apos;re going to do with a patient .
it creates a very strong image in the head . it &apos;s very much more more than a white pill .
this graph is really -- i &apos;m going to show you a different time when we have a narrative .
so the same thing is that the white pill is not as good as the blue pill , which is not so good as the blue pill , who doesn &apos;t make so good like the needle .
and none of it has a really <unk> process , and it &apos;s only our belief that we have to be able to get a stronger effect .
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a verb .
i take something that &apos;s obviously a deception , and i &apos;m going to see it real .
we know from the study that you need to get to the needle , if it &apos;s going to go to the thing .
this is a 18 centimeters long . it &apos;s very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m very , very <unk> . and i &apos;m going to put it a little bit .
this is really my flesh . it &apos;s not <unk> <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a <unk> of hollywood .
i &apos;m going to put this needle in my skin and go through it through them , until they go back to the other side .
if you look , if you go down -- if you &apos;re just going to <unk> -- i &apos;ve got a couple of friends last night in the room , and some people i didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s a woman that i didn &apos;t know .
so , i propose if you get quickly <unk> , then you look at the next 30 seconds , or you know what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to do the first <unk> part here .
you can see it in the same way , but you can also <unk> if you want to .
so , it &apos;s like this , right here , where my flesh starts in the bottom part of my arm , i &apos;m just going to do a little <unk> .
really sorry . do you do that crazy ?
and now just a little bit about my skin , and on the other side , the other side .
now we &apos;re actually in the same situation that we had in <unk> .
about it .
but now you can &apos;t count my fingers , right ?
so i &apos;m going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , four , five .
well , yeah .
i know what people think if you see this .
they say , &quot; okay , that &apos;s not so stupid , and <unk> itself is the skin , just to talk for us a couple of minutes . &quot;
well , i &apos;m going to show you .
what does this look like this ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people on the back is , &quot; okay . i don &apos;t have seen that right . &quot;
the people in the <unk> are now in the <unk> .
let me show you from the <unk> .
that &apos;s really my skin . it &apos;s not a <unk> of hollywood .
this is my flesh , and i can see the <unk> .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re <unk> , look at it , you don &apos;t look at it .
the people on the back or the ones that i &apos;m going to see at the video later , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; well , it &apos;s right now , but if it was real , he would be -- you see , here &apos;s a hole and there , if it was really true , it would be <unk> . &quot;
okay , let me give you a little blood for them .
yeah , here it is .
now , i &apos;d like to take the needle .
i &apos;d like to clean my arm and show you that there is no <unk> .
but i think , in this level here , and with the intent , from a deception , i &apos;m going to make the needle just there , and i &apos;m going to go back to the bottom of the stage .
we &apos;re going to spend a few times a couple of time .
i hope you &apos;re going to look at it . thank you very much .
everybody &apos;s talking about happiness today .
i &apos;ve taken some people to count the number of books that have been published with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title of the last five years , and they gave about 40 to about 40 , and there was a lot more .
there &apos;s a massive wave of interest on happiness under researchers .
there are very much <unk> .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but despite all of these <unk> of work , there are thousands of cognitive <unk> , which is almost impossible to think about happiness .
and my talk today is actually going to act of these cognitive teeth .
that &apos;s true for <unk> that you think about their own happiness , and it &apos;s true for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we &apos;re just so <unk> like everyone else .
the first one of these <unk> is a <unk> , complexity .
it turns out that word happiness doesn &apos;t seem to be a useful word , because we &apos;re using it to many different things .
i think there &apos;s a certain meaning that we could use it , but in the same time , this is something that we need to be going to give us , and we &apos;re going to find the complicated view of what &apos;s well-being .
and the second case is an idea of experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life , or happy with his life .
and these are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the emotional fact that we can &apos;t think about a fact that we can &apos;t think of well-being without the importance of well-being .
i mean , this is a real cognitive case .
there &apos;s just no way to get it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with a example of somebody who had a <unk> <unk> , who was written a story after one of my lectures , and it was absolutely amazing music , and it was absolutely tragic music , and it was just at the end of the list , there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then he created , really , really extraordinary , that &apos;s the whole experience .
but it didn &apos;t have it .
what it was , was the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had been <unk> music .
they don &apos;t grow because he was <unk> , and it was <unk> , and that &apos;s what he was <unk> , and that &apos;s what he was going to get on .
what that really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and other people might think in the sense of two ways of self .
there &apos;s a <unk> self that lives in the present , and the present is able to see the past , to see the past , but basically only the present .
it &apos;s the <unk> self , who &apos;s the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor says , &quot; do it look at you here ? &quot;
and then there &apos;s a <unk> self , and the <unk> itself is that the <unk> and the story of our lives , and it &apos;s that the doctor of the doctor , it &apos;s the question , &quot; how did you feel in the last time ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your journey to tunisia ? &quot; or that &apos;s like this .
these are two very different units , the <unk> itself , and the <unk> self , and the <unk> self is part of the <unk> of the <unk> of happiness .
well , the <unk> self is a storyteller .
and this is really what &apos;s happening with a fundamental response to our memories -- it &apos;s going to go right now .
we don &apos;t tell only stories if we &apos;re doing to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , which is what we &apos;re going to do from our knowledge is a story .
and let &apos;s start <unk> with a example .
there &apos;s a old study .
these are real patients that have a painful process that &apos;s <unk> .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details . it &apos;s not more painful , but it was painful than this study in the 1990s .
they were asked to tell all the 60 seconds about their pain .
and here are two patients . these are their view .
and they &apos;re going to ask , &quot; who &apos;s got more <unk> ? &quot;
and this is a very simple question .
so , b b has been <unk> , and his <unk> was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient had a child b , and more .
but now there &apos;s another question : &quot; how much thought these patients were that they thought ? &quot;
and here &apos;s a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient had a lot of <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , as a patient , as a patient .
the stories of <unk> were different , and because a very important part of the story is how they end up .
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or great -- but one of them is this clear ...
but one of them is clearly worse than the other .
and the ones that &apos;s worse is where the pain was in the end of his peak , and it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their <unk> , and also a lot later , &quot; how bad was the whole thing ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a half of a day for b in the <unk> .
well , this is a stable conflict between the <unk> self and the <unk> self .
on the bottom of the <unk> itself , b was clearly a simple time .
now , what you could do with patient a patient , and we &apos;ve actually done clinical experiments , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , and it &apos;s done , you could actually have the <unk> of patient a <unk> by the patient , not too much for him .
it &apos;s going to make that the patient is affected , but only a little bit less than before .
and if you make that a couple of minutes , you have to make that the <unk> self is a bad thing , and you have to make that the <unk> self is a much better thing , because now you have patient a much better story about his experience .
what is a story of a story ?
and that &apos;s true for the stories that make memory , and it &apos;s also true for the stories that we invent .
and that &apos;s a story of a story <unk> , major moments and end .
they &apos;re very , very important , very important , and in this case , <unk> the end .
well , the <unk> self lives in life .
it &apos;s got moments of <unk> , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really easy . they &apos;re always lost .
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i &apos;ve been thinking -- you know the psychological present than about three seconds long . what means you know that there are about 600 million of them . in a month , there are about 600 million of them .
most of them will be completely ignored by <unk> itself .
and yet , it &apos;s kind of got the impression that they should count that what was happening during this few moments of <unk> is our lives .
it &apos;s the <unk> resource we use in this world .
and as we use them to be important , but that &apos;s not the story that &apos;s not the story for us .
so we &apos;ve got the <unk> self and the <unk> self , and they &apos;re really pretty different .
the biggest difference between you is about time .
from the <unk> self , if you &apos;ve got a keyboard , and the second week was exactly as well as the first week , the second week is twice as good as the <unk> .
that &apos;s why it doesn &apos;t work for the <unk> self .
for the <unk> self , a <unk> squared is hardly better than the <unk> <unk> , because there &apos;s no new memories .
they haven &apos;t changed the story .
and in this way , it &apos;s actually the critical variable , which is a <unk> self is different from a <unk> self . time has a very little impact on this story .
now , the <unk> itself makes more than remember and to tell stories .
it &apos;s actually the understanding of the decisions , because if you have a patient , you say , you &apos;re going to say two <unk> in two different films , and you decide to decide what he &apos;s going to choose is that it &apos;s going to be less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be used .
the <unk> self has no voice in this choice .
in fact , we don &apos;t choose between knowledge . we choose between memories of experiences .
and even if we think about the future , we don &apos;t usually think of our future as a lot .
we think about our future as <unk> memories .
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a <unk> of the <unk> self , and you can think of the <unk> self as one , which is a way that <unk> the <unk> itself doesn &apos;t need .
i &apos;ve got the impression that if we &apos;re going to make bed , that &apos;s very often the case that we &apos;re doing , we &apos;re going to make a <unk> , in the health of the <unk> itself .
and this is a little hard thing to do , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we do from our memories ?
this is one of the explanations that &apos;s going to be given for the <unk> of the <unk> itself .
and if i think about it , i think i &apos;ve done a couple of years ago in antarctica , which is just the best installation that i had ever had , and i think relatively often about the relationship that i &apos;ve ever been thinking about .
and i &apos;ve probably heard of my memories on this <unk> journey , i &apos;d like to say about 25 minutes long in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the <unk> with the 600 images , i spent a more hour ago .
well , this is three weeks ago , and that &apos;s just a half of hours .
it seems to give it a <unk> .
well , i like to be a little bit extremely extraordinary , you know , how little <unk> i have on the <unk> of memories , but even if you make memories of it , it &apos;s a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the <unk> to the weight that we &apos;re familiar with ?
so i want you to think about a thought about a thought .
imagine the next bed , you know that at the end of the <unk> , you know that at the end of the <unk> , and you get a <unk> drug , so you get a <unk> drug , so you can &apos;t remember it .
now , would you choose the same keyboard ?
and if you would choose a different keyboard , there &apos;s a conflict between their two species of self , and you have to think about how they choose this conflict , and that &apos;s really not obvious because if you think of time in the senses , you get a answer . and if you could think in the sense of memories , you could get a different answer .
why we choose the <unk> that we &apos;re going to take a problem with a choice between the two species of self .
now , the two species of self , two rules of happiness .
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the <unk> self ?
and then they would ask : how happy are the moments in the lives of the <unk> self ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
and , by the way , we &apos;re going to be able to get a pretty good idea of the happiness of <unk> itself over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the <unk> self , it &apos;s a whole different thing .
this is not about how happy a person lives .
it &apos;s about how happy or answers the person is when these person think about their lives .
very different term .
everybody who doesn &apos;t get this way to make the debate of happiness , and i &apos;m part of a lot of researchers about a lot of researchers talking about well-being , which is the study of happiness for happiness in exactly this way .
the distinction between the happiness of <unk> itself , and the happiness of the <unk> self is recognized in the last few years , and now you &apos;re working on to measure the two <unk> .
the <unk> organization has been a global conference where more than a half million people were wondering about what they think about their life and about their experiences , and there were other efforts in the direction .
so in the last few years , we started to learn about the happiness of all the other species of themselves .
and the first lesson we think i think i learned is that they &apos;re really different .
you can know how happy someone with his life is , and that doesn &apos;t tell you a lot about how happy it lives and vice versa .
just just to give you a sense of well-being , the comfort is about <unk> .
what that means is that if you would meet somebody , and you would tell you , oh , his father is a <unk> , how much would you know about his size ?
well , they would know something about his size , but there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell you that somebody &apos;s life as eight on a scale of 10 , they have a lot of uncertainty about how happy it is to be with his <unk> self .
so the comfort is low .
we know something about what the happiness is .
we know that money is very important , targets are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly to be happy with people that we like to spend time to spend time with people we like .
there are other pleasure , but this is the nervous .
so if you don &apos;t want to have the happiness for the two species of self , they &apos;re going to do very different things .
and the conclusion of what i said here is that we should be lucky to think that we should really be lucky than a <unk> for well-being .
it &apos;s a completely different term .
well , just briefly , another reason that we &apos;re not clear about happiness is that we don &apos;t look at the same things if we think about life , and if we actually live in life , and if we actually live .
so if you ask the simple question , how happy people in california are not going to get the right answer .
if you ask this question , you think that people are happy to be happier if you don &apos;t have to be happier when you say , in ohio life .
and what happens is that if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is to say , in climate .
well , it turns out that climate change is not very important for the <unk> self , and it &apos;s not even very important for the <unk> self , which means how happy people are .
but now , because it &apos;s responsible , you can see at the end -- some people could get on the end to california .
and it &apos;s kind of interesting to look at what happens to the people who are going to go to california in hope to be happier .
well , you &apos;re not going to be happier .
we know that .
but one thing is going to happen . you &apos;re going to think that they &apos;re happier , because if you think about it , you &apos;re going to think about how awful the weather of weather in ohio , and they &apos;re going to feel that they &apos;ve met the right decision .
it &apos;s very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i hope to give you a sense of how hard it is .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question to you .
thank you .
now , when we did a couple of weeks ago , they told me that there was a pretty interesting result that there was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this area .
is this something that you can do with us , because you &apos;ve got a couple of minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most interesting result that we &apos;ve found in the <unk> conference is a number of numbers that we didn &apos;t expect to find .
we found that in terms of happiness itself .
if we looked at how emotion with the income .
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars a year , for americans , and this is a very big <unk> of americans , about <unk> , but it &apos;s a big <unk> <unk> , under a income of 400,000 dollars in a year in the year .
five .
<unk> : 60,000 .
60 dollars in the year , people are unhappy , and they &apos;re going to be more depressed , they &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
that &apos;s how we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i haven &apos;t seen so flat lines .
so what happens is , obviously , the money is not <unk> , but that is that lack of money , and that lack of money , and we can measure this misery very , very clear , and we can measure this misery very , very clear .
in the sense of the other self , the <unk> self , they get a different story .
and the more money you &apos;re going to do is you &apos;re going to do it .
that &apos;s not true for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american revolution , it &apos;s about life , freedom , to balance .
if people would take this <unk> seriously , i mean , it seems to see everything on the head , all of what we believe , for example , in terms of <unk> and so forth .
is there a chance that politicians , is that the country is actually going to be in china as seriously as seriously , and it would be based on politics ?
<unk> : you know , i think it &apos;s <unk> for the role of <unk> in politics .
the resolution is going to be slowly in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom , it &apos;s just happening , and in other countries , they &apos;re going to be happening in other countries .
the people are thinking that they should think of happiness when they think of politics .
it &apos;s going to take a long time , and people will discuss whether you want to explore <unk> or whether you want to explore <unk> , so we need to have this discussion pretty soon .
as well as happiness can increase very different , as you think about how you think , and whether you think about the <unk> self , or whether you think about the <unk> itself .
this is going to change politics , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states , you have <unk> to measure the <unk> of the population .
this is , i think , in the next one , or two decades of the national statistics of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , it seems to me , or we should be the most interesting political debate for the next few years .
thank you very much for the invention of evolution .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i am jane <unk> . i design video games .
i &apos;ve done for 10 years ago , and my goal for the next decade , and my goal for the next decade , it &apos;s so easy to save the world in reality , how to save them in <unk> .
i &apos;ve got a plan for that . i want to convince more people , including all of you to spend more time with playing a little bit more and <unk> games .
now , we spend three billion hours per week a week .
some of you may think , &quot; this is a whole lot of time for games . &quot;
maybe a lot of time , if you think about how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
but in fact , my research on the institute of the future , is exactly the opposite .
three billion hours per week per week is not almost enough to solve the most important problems of the world .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase this time .
i realized that it took time in 21 billion hours a week .
so this seems to be a <unk> , so i think it can be able to do this : if we are problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity , i think we need to try to deal with games online for at least 21 billion hours a week to go to the end of the next decade .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture describes pretty much exactly why i think games are so critical for the survival of human species in the future . seriously .
this is a <unk> of photographers <unk> .
he wanted to bring the feelings to play . so he had been able to get the players a camera .
this is one of the classical origins in play .
if you don &apos;t have the players , you might see some of the <unk> in this picture .
and you probably see this sense of urgency , something scared , but also <unk> , <unk> in the future of a really difficult problem .
if you look at it , you see a couple of <unk> here , and the mouth is a sign of optimism , and the mouth is a sign of optimism .
this is a player who &apos;s on the edge of one called <unk> <unk> .
oh , you know , you know . ok . so we have some players here .
a <unk> dividend is a result that it &apos;s so very difficult that they didn &apos;t know before they didn &apos;t know that it was possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they &apos;re shocked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do something like this .
this player is a moment of <unk> <unk> .
and this is what we have to see about millions of faces on the entire world , if we &apos;re going to take the <unk> of the next century , the face of the next century , the face of which is the <unk> of all the <unk> .
well , unfortunately , we don &apos;t see this face in real life , if we look hard problems .
i call it as &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad . &quot; and it &apos;s actually my face , you see ? yeah ? ok .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m like , &quot; in life , i &apos;m bad . &quot;
this is a camera in my former house in berkeley , california , where i started in my <unk> , why we &apos;re in playing in play better than the real life .
this is a problem that many players have a lot of players .
we think we &apos;re not so good in the reality of play .
and i don &apos;t just mean less successful , even though it &apos;s heard about it .
we &apos;re going to get more . i mean , i mean , in the context of motivation , to do something <unk> , inspired to collaboration with each other .
if we &apos;re in a <unk> , i believe that many of us are changing in our best version , anytime and they &apos;re lucky to solve the problem to solve the problem as long as we need to try to do it again .
and in reality , if we fail , if we &apos;re <unk> , we feel often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel <unk> . we feel <unk> , maybe depressed , frustrated or <unk> .
these feelings we never have , if we play games , you &apos;re not going to play it .
and that &apos;s what i wanted to study as a student .
why is it impossible impossible to think about , you could not just achieve everything ?
how can we bring these feelings from the play in reality ?
so , i looked at games like the world of <unk> , which is the ideal environment to create <unk> .
and i found some of the things that we &apos;ve been able to be able to do is to do that in <unk> as possible .
so first , if you walk in one of these <unk> , especially in the world of <unk> , there are a lot of different characters that are ready to give you an <unk> mission , and that &apos;s all right .
but not only one mission , but a mission that &apos;s perfect to your current level in the game , right ?
so they create this .
they never get a challenge that they can &apos;t solve .
but always at the edge of their skills , you need to be <unk> , but there &apos;s no unemployment in the world of <unk> .
you &apos;re not sitting around , and it &apos;s <unk> . there are always <unk> to do something important .
and there are a lot of employees .
where they go , hundreds of thousands of people who are working with them to work with their <unk> mission .
we &apos;re not so simple in real life , this sense that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to stand .
and also , there &apos;s this area of history , this healthy story , why we are there and what we &apos;re doing .
then we get this whole positive feedback .
they &apos;ve got the level of the level up , &quot; and &quot; <unk> , &quot; or &quot; <unk> , &quot; a intelligence . &quot;
this actual feedback is not true in real life .
if i &apos;m going to leave this stage , i don &apos;t have to talk to one of a talk , and that &apos;s a crazy idea , after 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get this feedback in real life .
so , the problem of <unk> like the world of <unk> is that it &apos;s so <unk> , in the edge of a <unk> <unk> , that we would spend our entire time in this <unk> .
they &apos;re just better than reality .
since today , all the world , all the world of <unk> has spent millions of years ago to solve the virtual problems of <unk> .
that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound sounds .
but to see it in the context , about <unk> million years ago , we started to go to the first <unk> .
so , the first thing is <unk> .
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend on play with play , it &apos;s just the way you spend time in terms of the size of human development , which is extraordinary .
but also . because it turns out that we &apos;re using this entire time to play this whole time , actually change what we &apos;re doing as humans .
we &apos;re developing to the <unk> , <unk> creatures .
that &apos;s the truth . i think i think .
now , look at this interesting statistics that recently was published by a scientist of carnegie mellon university : the average young man in a country in a country with a strong <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the 21st year .
so , 10,000 hours is a very interesting number , from two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , <unk> hours of the <unk> that they spend in school , from the 10 grade to the <unk> of high school -- if you don &apos;t know .
so we &apos;ve got a full <unk> , in which young people learn so much learning what it means to be a good player , like all other things that they learn in school .
and maybe some of you have the new book of <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; i read .
so you know his theory of success , the theory of the success of 10,000 hours .
it &apos;s based on the great research of <unk> , that if we spend 10,000 hours with the <unk> study of one person to the 21st year , we &apos;re going to be able to talk about it .
we &apos;re going to be so good at what the most important people in the world .
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are <unk> .
so , the big question is , &quot; what &apos;s the players that are good ? &quot;
because if we could figure out that , we would never have been able to have the <unk> human potential .
so many people are now in the world that &apos;s going to spend at least a hour per day .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people who are extraordinary good in &quot; something . &quot;
and in the next decade , we have a different billion players that are extraordinary good in what they are .
if you haven &apos;t heard it .
the <unk> has evolved to save the energy , and we &apos;re working on <unk> , instead of the <unk> , so the players on the entire world , especially in india , china can play .
you expect a few billion players in the next decade .
that &apos;s how we have about 1.5 billion players .
so i started thinking about what it is that games are doing that games .
here are the four things i found . as first , <unk> .
ok , imagine how the extreme <unk> .
<unk> is the desire to do something to do something like this , a <unk> to me , with the belief that we have a <unk> hope for success .
facts always knows that a <unk> <unk> is possible , and that it &apos;s always important to try to try and look at it , and that &apos;s the same thing .
audience doesn &apos;t sit around .
parents are <unk> in spiders in the spiders of social nets .
and there &apos;s a lot of interesting study that show that we have people like more , after we &apos;ve played with them , even if you &apos;ve played with them .
so the reason is that there is a lot of trust to play with somebody &apos;s game .
we trust that somebody &apos;s time with us that the rules of the rules is that we &apos;re going to have the same goal , and we &apos;re going to get the same goal .
so it allows the <unk> to <unk> , trust and with each other .
and as a result of it , we &apos;re building more social relationships .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there &apos;s one reason why the <unk> of <unk> <unk> hours a week , just as <unk> .
the reason is that if we &apos;re playing , we &apos;re actually happier to work hard to work hard than if we &apos;re not going to do anything .
we know that we &apos;re doing as human beings work , if we &apos;re hard to do big work .
and players are always willing to work hard to work hard when they get the right task .
and finally , <unk> meaning .
love love to be part of the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
this is a <unk> , to put it into the right light , and you know , all wikipedia , the biggest bombsight of the world .
the second bombsight of the world , with almost 58 <unk> is the world of <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of <unk> in the internet as a lot of other story in every other <unk> of the world .
they create a <unk> story .
they create a <unk> source of knowledge about the world of <unk> .
ok , so , these are four memes that have a single result . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it &apos;s people who believe they can change the world as a single world .
and the only problem is that you think you can change the virtual worlds , but not the real thing .
that &apos;s the problem i &apos;m trying to solve .
bruce <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is brilliant . he &apos;s talking about why people are so much time , energy and money in <unk> .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re going to be <unk> by not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds and <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s from a economist . so it &apos;s weird .
and he says ...
not as i -- i have play games , i &apos;m kind of <unk> .
so he says , this is actually what makes sense , because players can achieve more than the real life .
they can make more social <unk> than in real life , and they get more feedback , and they get more feedback and rewards in play than in real life .
so , he says it &apos;s completely awful , that players spend more time in the virtual world than in real life .
i &apos;m just going to talk about that , that &apos;s weird .
but it &apos;s certainly not <unk> .
we need to start to get the real world in a game .
my inspiration comes from a event called <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
so , this amazing <unk> <unk> was <unk> .
and that was kind of the first one of people developed .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the book of the old cloud <unk> , you might know this story . the story about how and why games have invented .
<unk> became playing games , more <unk> , in the middle of the kingdom , in the middle of a famine .
we had this big famine , which was the king of <unk> <unk> to a crazy idea .
people thought . people were killed .
it was a extreme situation . you needed to have an extreme solution .
so they invented , according to <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> a national strategy , and one day you would eat food . the next day you would play .
and they would be able to be <unk> in the <unk> , because games are so fascinating and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity , that they wanted to forget that there was nothing to eat .
and then , at the next day , you would play . and the next day you would eat .
and according to <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> , so she had been able to have this famine , by the next day , and the next one was in front of the next .
that &apos;s why i think we &apos;re going to play games today .
we &apos;re playing games to get the suffering of real world .
we &apos;re going to give games a lot of things that doesn &apos;t work in the real world , all the time in real life is not <unk> , and we &apos;re taking ourselves out of what we need to play .
but that doesn &apos;t have to be the end .
that &apos;s the exciting thing .
according to <unk> , after 18 years , the famine was not better . so the king , the king , a last <unk> <unk> .
they shared the kingdom in two <unk> .
she was in a <unk> , and the gecko had been to a <unk> adventure .
they <unk> , and they made up to the search after a new house , and they &apos;re just going to get so many people coming back to survive , as it was used to survive with the rest of a area that they could be able to be able to do .
it sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> shows that the <unk> , which was going to be <unk> , the same dna , the same dna as the old <unk> , the same dna as the old <unk> .
so , scientists recently came to the notion that <unk> <unk> is actually true .
and jesus found evidence of a global <unk> , which was almost 20 years ago , which could explain the famine .
so this is how this crazy story might be .
maybe you &apos;ve actually had their people playing through games , by 18 years , and then they had <unk> <unk> , and then they had these <unk> , and so much about the time that they &apos;ve learned to play the entire civilization .
so , that &apos;s what we can do .
we &apos;re going to play since 2000 .
this was the first <unk> in real time in the world of the world of <unk> . it was 16 years ago .
they &apos;d be <unk> by 18 years , we &apos;re going to come back since 16 years ago .
i &apos;m thinking , we &apos;re ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of their civilization on the search for a new world , so i suppose my 21 billion <unk> a week .
we should be <unk> that half of us spend a hour per day to play with play , until we &apos;ve solved the problems of real world .
i know you &apos;re going to ask , &quot; how do we solve problems of the real world in play ? &quot; and this question i &apos;ve got my work in the last few years at the institute of the future .
we &apos;ve got this <unk> in our office in detroit <unk> , it <unk> how we should understand the future .
we don &apos;t want to try to say the future before .
what we want to do is create the future .
we want to imagine the best result , and then people are able to use this idea to change this idea in reality .
we &apos;re going to put ourselves in <unk> , and we give people the possibility to achieve them .
i &apos;m going to show you three games three games that i designed to try to try to try to get people in their own future .
this is the world without oil . &quot;
the game is from 2007 .
it &apos;s a <unk> , in which you have to be able to overcome a <unk> .
so , the <unk> is invented , but we &apos;ve got enough <unk> , so it will be realistic for them , and they &apos;re actually going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re in the same time , and you &apos;re going to get rid of where they &apos;re living . and then you get rid of what it is , and then you have to figure out what you &apos;re going to do when it &apos;s true , and then you have to ask them to <unk> , videos or photographs .
we &apos;ve got this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and we &apos;ve been <unk> over the last three years .
and i can tell you , it was a <unk> experience .
nobody wants to change life because it &apos;s good for the environment or because we should .
but if you &apos;re in a <unk> adventure , and i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to be from the oil . &quot;
this is an amazing adventure that you &apos;re going to do .
think of how they were going to survive . most of our players who are going to be able to do in the game of <unk> behavior .
so we &apos;ve got a bigger game for the next <unk> game of a bigger , higher goal than just <unk> .
we have the game &quot; <unk> &quot; in the institute of the future .
and in the way , the theories of a <unk> , that people have only 23 years on the planet in the planet .
this <unk> is called the global <unk> <unk> , of course , of course .
the call to players , <unk> , we &apos;ve designed almost like a &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> . &quot;
they know jerry <unk> , where it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; you &apos;ve got the astronauts , the scientists , the <unk> , and only together you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of just five people , we say , everyone is in the <unk> , and it &apos;s our challenge , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice .
they &apos;d have the players in the game eight weeks ago .
they found 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can read when they call &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and the last game we &apos;re going to do at the third march , and it &apos;s a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you end up the game , you get out of the world bank of the <unk> <unk> , <unk> 2010 .
we &apos;re working with universities in the middle of sub-saharan africa and store them to learn social .
we have a film that we have , we &apos;ve got to understand the level of <unk> , <unk> , sustainability , vision , vision and talents .
i want to share you all to share this game with young people all over the world , especially in the world , especially in <unk> , who benefit to save their own social <unk> to save the world .
i &apos;m going to go back to the end .
i want to ask you something like this .
what do you think happens next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we haven &apos;t saved the real world .
well , i hope you &apos;re telling me that players are human resources that we can use to work in real life , and that games have a big meaning for change .
we &apos;ve got these whole <unk> , <unk> productivity , the ability to create social nets , <unk> and the desire for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we &apos;re going to play a lot of games to survive on this planet another century .
and i hope you &apos;re going to design with me that play with me and play .
now , when i go back to the next decade , i &apos;m sure that we can create each other , that we can create each other future , and that we can see all kinds of games .
so i say , let &apos;s take the <unk> games .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to tell you something about what i &apos;d like to write a few months ago to write a <unk> .
i was always going to write my <unk> , but i was working with the <unk> , and i realized that i had never done in my life , which is what the word , &quot; <unk> , &quot; really means .
i read the chart .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> : &quot; <unk> , helpless , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt ; em &amp; gt .
<unk> : healthy , strong , <unk> . &quot;
and i had to read this list of a friend , and i had to say that it was so ridiculous , but i had to end up , and i didn &apos;t have to read , and i had to end up , and we had to end up , and i had to go back to this <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s a <unk> block .
of course , this was a <unk> , old <unk> , and i just thought that this is really a very old thing to be pretty old .
but in fact , it was a copy on the early 80s when i started talking to the school , and so i started to create my way outside my family outside my family and form , in other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god is not going to be able to use the <unk> .
so , i &apos;d like to take this thing seriously , i would be born in a world that someone would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
so , i looked at the <unk> of 2009 , and i thought that i think i think there &apos;s a <unk> place .
here &apos;s the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
in fact , the last two words , the last two words under &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and &quot; healthy . &quot;
but it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s about what we think about people think about that words .
it &apos;s about the values that are in these words , and how we create these values .
our language is changing our thinking and how we see the world and people see around us .
a lot of <unk> societies , including the greeks , and the <unk> , really believed that the <unk> of a <unk> is a big force , because that &apos;s what you can see , it &apos;s also <unk> .
so , what do we really want to do -- a miracle of people or a healthy people ?
it &apos;s already used to call a human <unk> as a child , could be <unk> , and they <unk> them with them .
wouldn &apos;t it be beautiful to open your doors ?
one man who opened up for me was my friend in the <unk> institute institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he &apos;s called dr. <unk> . a <unk> , the name , as you can think that most americans couldn &apos;t say correct . so he was going to call dr. <unk> .
and dr. <unk> had always been very <unk> , and he was able to get to work with children just like this .
i found the time that i spent in this hospital , just wonderful -- until my <unk> .
and i had to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> with these <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- in various different colors -- that you know to make my <unk> , and i took these <unk> more than anything else , and i put them down . i &apos;ve <unk> them .
and imagine , i &apos;ve even seen as a <unk> kid with dr. <unk> , and so trying to stop these efforts , <unk> without success .
and one day he looked at me in one of my efforts -- these trials were just <unk> and <unk> -- and he said to me , &quot; wow , aimee , you &apos;re so a strong , brilliant and young girls , you &apos;re going to get one day one day .
and if you create it , i &apos;ll give you a hundred dollars . &quot;
and of course , it was just a simple trick of dr. <unk> , so i don &apos;t want to do the invitation that i didn &apos;t want to do with the robot that i didn &apos;t really want to see my daily <unk> girl in the second room , but it was actually a new and <unk> experience .
and i ask myself today , how very much his vision of me as a strong and brilliant young girls , and i could imagine that i could imagine as one of nature , powerful and <unk> human beings .
this is just an example of many , like adults in <unk> the imagination of a child .
but in fact , as you can show the <unk> examples of the <unk> , we can &apos;t imagine our language , it doesn &apos;t tell us something that we &apos;re all told about : it &apos;s going to allow every single person to see yourself as a healthy people .
our language <unk> the social changes , which is that in many cases , in many cases , through a technological change .
and of course , you can tell you that my legs , the <unk> , of course , is that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> from titan and artificial <unk> for <unk> bodies , people are able to use their own identity , to change the way that they allow them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use them .
so maybe this technological change is important because the fact that there was still a different truth , which is that every man of a society , is that every person of the society of society and very radical , and that the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus .
the human ability to adapt -- that &apos;s a interesting story , because people always ask me to tell you how i &apos;m <unk> , and i &apos;m going to tell you a little bit : this sentence has never been <unk> , and i &apos;ve always been able to tell you the question of people to answer to people , and i think , i know , i understand why .
so this sentence from the <unk> lives of the idea that success or happiness is based on the idea that success or happiness is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to deal with a <unk> , or as people can &apos;t see me with my disability .
but the truth is that we &apos;re changing . of course , we &apos;re thinking of the challenge , whether it &apos;s <unk> , emotional or even both .
and i tell you that this is good .
<unk> are not an instrument that we need to have <unk> , to come with our lives better .
<unk> are just about our lives .
and i tend to see <unk> as my shadows .
sometimes i think it &apos;s very close to me , sometimes he &apos;s not going to see it , but it &apos;s all about me .
and i don &apos;t want to be the effect of the impact or the difficult of the <unk> of a human <unk> .
there are <unk> and challenges , and these are just <unk> real , and every person is going to be different , but the question is not whether we &apos;re looking at <unk> , or not , but how we &apos;re looking at it .
so we &apos;re not just responsible for the people that we love to get out of <unk> , but they also want to be able to be able to be able to get it right now .
and we don &apos;t like our kids , if we give them the feeling that they can &apos;t be able to adapt .
you &apos;ve got to notice two things : to get one of the medical fact , to be <unk> , and the other social opinion about whether i &apos;m <unk> or not .
and to be honest , the only real and <unk> disability that i had to go apart , is that the world is all the time , they could describe me with these issues .
in our wish that people have to protect the people who are in the heart , and you know the cold , hard truth about their medical <unk> , or even to see a <unk> of quality of life that they expect to be , we &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
maybe the current concept that &apos;s only about what &apos;s going on in a broken , and how we repair it , for every single one has a bigger disability than the <unk> .
if we don &apos;t deal with a people , and not all the forces and possibilities , we &apos;re able to figure out the natural battle that you might have to be able to be able to create a more disease .
we <unk> a people who has a value for our society .
so we need to look at the <unk> , and we &apos;re going to focus on all sorts of human possibilities .
but the most important thing is that it &apos;s between the perception of our <unk> and our great <unk> , a connection .
we should not try to avoid these <unk> times , or <unk> , we should not try to avoid them , we should get them under the <unk> , but it &apos;s about to see in the <unk> issues .
it may be more important to imagine that we don &apos;t have to be <unk> , but that we &apos;re open for it , it &apos;s <unk> , you can use them to put them on the <unk> , to put it into a <unk> , and maybe even to dance .
and maybe we &apos;re able to do it as something of natural , <unk> and useful and useful , and you feel that through their presence , they don &apos;t feel like that .
in this year , we &apos;re going to celebrate 200 years ago by charles darwin , and when he wrote 150 years ago about evolution , darwin , in my eyes , to something very true in the human character .
i would be able to get it out , not the <unk> of his way , and also not the <unk> of his way , but it &apos;s not the <unk> of the way that changes in the best .
billions of billions of creativity is creativity .
not only from darwin , we know that the ability of people to survive and survive and <unk> , from the battle of human mind , is that it &apos;s about conflict .
so , again , change and creativity are the biggest skill of people .
and maybe we know about what wood is we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
maybe this is the sense of <unk> , a perception of the <unk> , a sense of <unk> , a sense of our own force .
we can give us something like this .
we can give <unk> a new meaning that &apos;s about severe times .
maybe we can see <unk> as change .
<unk> are <unk> for a change that we don &apos;t have to have .
i think the biggest damage that we have to do was believe that we should be normal .
but honestly , who &apos;s normal ?
there is no normal .
there are the usual . the opposite . but not the normal thing , and you would really learn to learn that poor person really want to learn if it really was ?
i think , rather , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of <unk> against another of the possibilities or the strength , to make it even a little bit more complicated , we could use the forces of very many children , and they &apos;re waiting to teach their very special and useful skills in society .
we &apos;ve found out that we &apos;ve always found people from the members of our society , which is useful to be useful and able to afford a contribution .
so there are evidence that the flowers have been in front of 60 years ago , and people who have been able to have a lot of healthy injuries , and that &apos;s what happened , because the <unk> in the <unk> of these people are valuable .
they don &apos;t have these people as broken and useless , and they &apos;ve been treated as a little bit .
a couple of years ago , i went to the city that i grew up in a <unk> in this &quot; red zone , &quot; in this &quot; red lake , &quot; in the woods of pennsylvania , and i was there a <unk> <unk> .
it was summer , and i had <unk> <unk> .
and i hear how a guy behind me says , &quot; well , if that &apos;s not simplicity . &quot;
and i &apos;m interested in and see this older man . i didn &apos;t know who he is .
and i said , &quot; sorry , sir , we know ? i don &apos;t remember them . &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you don &apos;t expect to remember me .
when i saw them at the first time , i took them out of the belly of her mother . &quot;
oh , so , that &apos;s the way .
and of course , it &apos;s done .
this was dr. <unk> , a man that i heard about narratives of my mother &apos;s day , because i knew , of course , i &apos;ve been able to come back to my birthday two weeks ago .
the doctor for <unk> <unk> of my mom was in the keyboard , and so my parents knew the man who brought me to the world , not .
and because i was born without <unk> , and my feet after you had to end up , and i only had a couple of toes on this , and a couple of toes on the other foot , he was the <unk> , that strangers had to make the bad news .
and he said to me , &quot; i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never be as <unk> as other children or that you could never have a <unk> life , and since you &apos;ve never done it . &quot;
in fact , i realized that he was <unk> by my entire childhood school , not if i was going to be <unk> in the second grade in the second grade , whether i was going to be <unk> in the second grade in the second grade , not if i had my child , or one of my <unk> school , and the <unk> medical school , and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of the human spirit .
you can &apos;t just explain enough , how critical this factor is for the quality of life .
and dr. <unk> said , he said , &quot; i &apos;ve learned that kids , if you don &apos;t have to say something else , and even if you only get a little support , if you &apos;re going to get kids , you can get kids , you can get kids very much . &quot;
you see , dr. <unk> has been changing .
he understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone of them are doing , two different things are .
and i &apos;ve done my thinking about the time when they asked me in the age of 15 years , if i &apos;d asked my <unk> against legs from meat and bones , i would have no second <unk> .
i really wanted to be poor at the same time .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and this is what happens because i &apos;ve seen something with my legs , and not despite this experience .
and maybe this change actually could happen because i &apos;m going to be able to get my doors , rather than people who have opened my doors , rather than people who wanted me to get me , or i wanted to have a sense of <unk> .
see , it really takes one of the people who <unk> their forces , and they &apos;re through it .
if you allow somebody to get your own , open forces -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you create that , and for someone in a critical moment , you &apos;re going to open up a door , you &apos;re going to be a very good teacher for these people are a very good teacher .
they &apos;re going to get them to open bridges .
the principle of <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> in the word &quot; <unk> . &quot;
it means to create something that is in one , the potential <unk> .
again , what potential potential is we want to stop .
in the 1960s , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , in the u.k. , in the u.k.
they call this &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; in the united states , we call this as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
the students are going to go to notes .
and that a student is going to be <unk> harder , the better teachers , and they get better teachers .
and they &apos;ve been asked about a <unk> period of students with a &quot; enough , &quot; the word &quot; is very good , and it was told them that they were very smart , and after these three months , she was actually written .
and of course , it took one of the heart to hear that wherever the <unk> was told , they &apos;re only enough .
and that was the same time after the three months .
but only the ones that were still in the school -- except from the students who had the school <unk> .
it was critical to this study that the teachers were not <unk> .
the teachers didn &apos;t know that something was changed .
you just told you that are the <unk> , and that &apos;s the students with the film , and that &apos;s why they &apos;ve taught them something , and they &apos;re treated with them , and they &apos;re treated them .
the only real disability is a <unk> mind , which was broken , didn &apos;t have the hope anymore . it doesn &apos;t have the hope that we don &apos;t have the natural , <unk> <unk> and our <unk> ability of imagination .
but if we create it , to support the human mind , we &apos;re going to continue to try to hope themselves , self and other people to find beautiful , curious and <unk> , we &apos;re going to put our forces really positive .
if a spirit about these qualities , we can create a new reality and new <unk> .
i &apos;d like to end with a poem that was written by a <unk> writer called <unk> in the university century , and he said , &quot; the god , god , who knows only four words . &quot;
come , dance with me . thank you .
how would you want to be better than they &apos;re now ?
in fact , i said that , through few changes of their genes , a better memory could have a better memory -- <unk> , more and faster .
or you want to be <unk> , more force , more force .
do you want to make smart and more .
how would it be to live in good health ?
or maybe you &apos;re one of whom that &apos;s always <unk> by more creativity .
so what would you like to think ?
what would you like to have if you could only have one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a couple of . probably about so many of the things that are creative people here .
that &apos;s very good .
how many would you choose a good memory ?
a few more .
how would it be with <unk> ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
ah , the majority . i like to ask , as a doctor .
if you could only have one of them , it would be a whole different world .
is it all <unk> ?
or is it maybe possible ?
evolution is a <unk> issue here on the ted project , but today , i want to give you the point of a doctor .
now , the big <unk> in the 20th century , <unk> <unk> , who was also a <unk> in the <unk> church of church , he wrote a blog with the title , &quot; nothing in biology is not a sense , except in the <unk> of evolution . &quot;
now , if you &apos;re one of those of those who don &apos;t teach the evidence for the biological evolution , this would be a very good moment , you &apos;re going to take your <unk> -- i &apos;ll give you permission -- and maybe you can see a look at <unk> <unk> &apos;s book , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to be wrong for them , because nothing else is going to make sense for them .
but if you accept biological evolution , you &apos;re thinking about this : is it just about the past , or it &apos;s about the future ?
is it possible for other <unk> , or is it possible for us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i got a bush as a center of the <unk> in all directions , because if you look at the <unk> of the body of life , all of the things we &apos;ve been looking at in evolutionary ideas : they have survive ; it has been eaten ; it has to survive the environment and strength .
the human part of this <unk> , far at the end , of course , is that what we &apos;re most interested in most about .
and we <unk> from a common ancestors to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in this time , there was maybe 20 or 25 different <unk> of <unk> .
some of them came up .
we &apos;ve been here for about <unk> years ago .
it seems like we were right out of the other parts of the lives of life , but in fact , the biggest part is the fundamental mechanisms of our cells .
is it clear that we can use to use it , and the mechanisms of a common bacterium can be able to produce the protein of the human <unk> , which is going to be used to treat <unk> ?
this is not like <unk> ; this is the same protein , the same protein is <unk> by what &apos;s going on from the line .
and where we &apos;re talking about bacteria , is you realize that every one of us in our gut are more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe 10 times .
i mean , you &apos;re thinking , you know , if you look at <unk> , you think about the bacteria ?
our gut is a wonderful <unk> environment for these bacteria .
it &apos;s warm , it &apos;s dark , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s very happy .
and you &apos;re going to get all the nutrients that you might be able to be able to make a politician without a politician .
it &apos;s really a easier way to bacteria , with <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
but otherwise , they &apos;re a wonderful environment for these bacteria , just as they &apos;re important for their lives .
they &apos;re helping <unk> <unk> , and they protect them against certain diseases .
but what will happen in the future ?
are we in a kind of <unk> balance in form of a species ?
or are we going to be able to get something else -- something that might even even better change the environment ?
now let &apos;s start a step back in the time of 14 billion years ago -- the earth , the solar system , about four years ago -- the first sign of living organisms , maybe three to four billion years ago on earth -- the first <unk> organisms -- and then the human species , which is the world of the last <unk> years .
in this huge <unk> symphony of the universe , the life on the earth is just a minute ; the animal kingdom , like a single <unk> , and the human life , a little <unk> .
that &apos;s what we were .
so this is also the <unk> of this speech , so i hope , so i hope , and that &apos;s why i hope , of course .
now , when i was a <unk> on college , i had my first <unk> .
i was fascinated by the readers and beauty of biology .
i mean , i was in the force of evolution , and i asked something very fundamental : most of the existence of life in <unk> organisms , all of the cell , and all the genetic information of the cell is going to get in both <unk> .
but in the time , as <unk> organisms , we started to change things .
<unk> <unk> comes into the image .
and really important : with the introduction of sexual <unk> , the genome is going to be <unk> the rest of the body .
in fact , you might say that the <unk> of the death of the death of our body in the same moment is how the automobiles are <unk> .
now , i &apos;ve got to say , if i was a <unk> , i thought , ok , sex / death , sex / death -- it seemed pretty painful to the time , but with every year , it &apos;s done to me .
i &apos;ve got to understand the feelings of george inventions that i read in <unk> , and his show in the &apos; 90s , in the &apos; 90s .
and one night , there &apos;s a <unk> on his <unk> .
he opens the door .
it &apos;s a beautiful <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
she looks at him and says , &quot; i &apos;m here for <unk> . &quot;
&quot; this is wonderful , &quot; oh george , &quot; i &apos;m going to take the soup . &quot;
i came up to believe as a doctor that i had a goal that was different than the goal of evolution -- not enough , just different .
i tried to get the body .
i wanted to think healthy .
i wanted to do the health to a disease .
i wanted to get a long and healthy life .
evolution is all about the <unk> of the genome of the next generation , <unk> and survival generation after generation .
so , in an evolutionary standpoint , they are , and i &apos;ve evolved as <unk> rockets to send the genetic <unk> in the next stage to send the genetic <unk> into the next stage to go to the ocean .
i think we &apos;re all going to be able to understand that we &apos;re going to be able to understand all of you , as he said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do hatred through my work .
i want to do it by not die . &quot;
evolution doesn &apos;t think about the local life .
it &apos;s not <unk> the biggest , the most important or the fastest , and not even the homeless .
evolution <unk> the creatures that adapt to the best of their environment .
it &apos;s only the test of survival and success .
on the bottom of the ocean , bacteria are there , and that &apos;s the <unk> survive , and it &apos;s going to survive , if fish would be there , it would be vacuum <unk> fish , but they &apos;ve done it to be able to make a <unk> environment .
so , what does that mean when we look at what happens in evolution , and how we think about the space of people in evolution , and in fact , how we <unk> <unk> in the next phase , i would say that there is a series of possibilities .
the first one is that we &apos;re not going to change .
we &apos;ve got a kind of balance .
and the reason for that , the reason was that we &apos;ve done for medicine , has been able to get a lot of genes that would be more <unk> , and the population would have been removed from the population .
and second , we have a species of a species that we &apos;ve done our environment , that we &apos;ve done that they were able to adapt to us , and we &apos;re able to adapt to them , and we &apos;re able to adapt them to them .
and by the way , we <unk> and <unk> , and that &apos;s so much that you can &apos;t say that it &apos;s needed to say that the spirit is necessary for evolution , for evolution , to <unk> .
one second way is that it will be a evolution of traditional , of course , of course , <unk> of the forces of nature .
and the argument , here would be that the wheels of evolution slowly , but they &apos;re <unk> .
and so far as a species , when we get a species out of planets , it &apos;s going to be <unk> and the changes of the environment that could produce evolution in natural ways .
but there &apos;s a third opportunity , an <unk> , fascinating and amazing opportunity .
i call it <unk> -- the new development that &apos;s not just of course , but led and decided that we decided to be <unk> in the decisions that we do .
well , how could that happen ?
how could it be possible that we &apos;re doing this ?
now let &apos;s see the reality that people are today , in some cultures decisions about their offspring .
they are , in some cultures , the choice to have more men than women .
it &apos;s not necessarily good for society , but it &apos;s what the individual and the family .
so think if it &apos;s not only possible possible to choose the gender of their child , but also in the body of genetic <unk> , the diseases would cure and help .
what if you could make the genetic changes to make diabetes or alzheimer &apos;s or alzheimer &apos;s , or <unk> , or <unk> ?
wouldn &apos;t you want to make these changes in their genes ?
if we <unk> , these kinds of changes are increasingly possible .
the human genome project started in 1990 , and it took 13 years .
it costs <unk> billion dollars .
at the next year , when it was done at 2004 , they were able to do the same for 20 million dollars in <unk> to four months .
today , you can get a sequence of three billion <unk> of the human genome to a price of about $ 20,000 , and in the room of about a week .
it &apos;s not going to take more long long time until the reality is that it &apos;s going to be the 1,000 dollars of human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everybody .
after a week ago , the national academy of technology was the <unk> prize for francis <unk> and <unk> <unk> , two scientists who developed the natural process of evolution to work faster , faster and <unk> proteins in a greater way -- which is called <unk> <unk> &quot; visible evolution . &quot;
a couple of years ago , the <unk> of the scientist , <unk> <unk> had been <unk> for his research in which he took an adults <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> by only four genes , the cell , to a <unk> cells -- a cell in the way is able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a cell in your body .
these changes are coming in .
the same technology that the human insulin is produced in bacteria can make viruses that are not only protection before itself , but also to be <unk> against other viruses .
whether you don &apos;t believe it or not , it &apos;s an experimental study in <unk> with a vaccine against <unk> that &apos;s in the cells of a <unk> .
can you imagine a little bit better , which is made out of <unk> ?
this is all reality today , and in the future is going to be a lot more possible .
imagine just two other little different changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of your <unk> ?
what if you could change the <unk> and <unk> , or the <unk> of a egg could change their children a better chance to give their children a better deal for a <unk> life , and the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer , the risk of cancer ?
who don &apos;t want to have more children ?
and then the <unk> technology , the same engine of science can allow us to prevent disease , to prevent disease , could also allow us to <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- the better memory .
why don &apos;t have been the <unk> of a c. <unk> , especially if you can turn it into the next generation of <unk> ?
why don &apos;t we have the fast <unk> that you &apos;re going to allow them to get faster and better ?
why not longer life ?
this is going to be <unk> .
and if we &apos;re in a place where we can use it on the next generation , and we can be able to have the characteristics that we &apos;re going to be used , we &apos;re going to be transformed by <unk> evolution .
we &apos;re going to have a process that &apos;s going to be in the rule of 100,000 years , and we can <unk> it on a thousand years -- and maybe even at the next hundred years .
these are decisions with whom their <unk> , or their grandchildren need to be done .
do we use these choices to form a society that &apos;s better , the more successful , that &apos;s more successful .
or are we going to choose <unk> different properties that we want to have for some of us , and not for other of us ?
are we going to create a society that is <unk> and <unk> , or <unk> and <unk> ?
these are the kinds of questions that we have to be living .
and the deepest of all , are we ever going to be able to develop the wisdom , and the wisdom that we &apos;re going to need to do is to meet these decisions ?
in the good way in the bad way in evil , and before you think , these decisions are going to be on us .
thank you .
i want you to imagine something like this , a <unk> robot that allows you to get <unk> skills , or another one of the things that helps you to go back and go back and go .
in berkeley , we call this robot <unk> .
they &apos;re not different than something that they &apos;re in the morning , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do is allow you to make additional strength , and it &apos;s going to help them make their balance .
that &apos;s actually the true <unk> of human and machine .
but not only that -- this is what we &apos;re doing , and we put them together with the universe and other devices out there .
that &apos;s not just a crazy idea .
so to show you now , what we &apos;re working on is we &apos;re starting to talk about the american soldiers who &apos;s about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s about 100 pounds on his back , and it &apos;s the word that they should carry more equipment .
of course , this leads to some major <unk> -- <unk> , 30 percent of it -- <unk> <unk> .
so we thought that we would think that we would think of this challenge and create a <unk> that would help us do with this problem .
so let me ask you now to imagine -- or the human <unk> <unk> .
sm : with the <unk> , i can carry 200 pounds about <unk> terrain , many hours long .
so flexible design allows it to be moving down to be moving , and <unk> and <unk> movements .
it feels what i want to do , where i want to go , and then i &apos;m looking at my strength and <unk> .
we &apos;re at the same thing with our <unk> , this new <unk> in this year .
so it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s look at our view on the <unk> , something that i &apos;m interested in , i &apos;m very pleased to do that .
there are 13 million people who sit in the next wheelchair .
this is about a percent of the population .
and that &apos;s actually a <unk> rule .
so today , we often talk about very young people who are in the <unk> of your life -- collaborator , charlie , abed -- from the destiny , and the wheelchair is the only option .
but it &apos;s also about the most important population , their number <unk> .
and so the only option -- if it &apos;s about a <unk> , or it &apos;s about other <unk> -- is the wheelchair .
and so , by the way , it &apos;s been since 500 years since his way i have to say , very successful .
so we thought we could start to write a completely new chapter in the area of mobility .
so let me imagine <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s been <unk> by 72 years ago , in the time , 19 years ago , the result was that they couldn &apos;t get more than 19 years ago .
thank you .
as i said , amanda is our <unk> .
it has sensors .
his completely <unk> sensors in the crutches , the signals of the signals on our <unk> , which is based on their back on the back of their back .
here &apos;s also <unk> , the <unk> is going to be on their elbow , just like to their <unk> , which they &apos;re moving around in this pretty <unk> and very natural <unk> .
i was 24 years old and in <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> .
in the fraction of a second i lost every sense , and every movement underneath my <unk> .
not long after a doctor , a doctor in my <unk> , and he said , &quot; amanda , they &apos;re never going to go back . &quot;
and that was 19 years ago .
he &apos;s treated every <unk> hope from my consciousness .
<unk> technologies , i &apos;ve been <unk> , to learn , to try to go back to <unk> , and even to drive with the hands with the hands .
but nothing has invented me to go back to me until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to meet us and talk to you with them .
it &apos;s in our hands , and we &apos;ve got the whole potential here to change the life of future generations -- not only for the soldiers , or for amanda here , and all the <unk> , but for all of them .
thank you .
in new york , i &apos;m going to go to the <unk> of a <unk> organization called <unk> <unk> .
if i don &apos;t <unk> the poverty , i <unk> as a <unk> of a <unk> <unk> in a volunteers &apos;s fire .
well , in our city , in our city , in the volunteers of a <unk> <unk> , you have to be pretty early on the <unk> to get <unk> .
i remember my first fire .
i was the second volunteers on the <unk> , so i had a very good opportunity to be in there .
but it was still a <unk> against the other volunteers to get the <unk> <unk> , and to figure out what our tasks would be .
when i found the <unk> , he had just been in a very serious conversation with the <unk> , which is certainly one of the worst days of their life .
and it was in the middle of night , and she was in the <unk> , and <unk> under a <unk> shelf in the <unk> rain , while her house was in front of it .
the other volunteers who came out to me was -- we call him <unk> luther -- <unk> <unk> as first and was asked to go to the house and to save the dog &apos;s dog &apos;s dog .
the dog ! i was <unk> <unk> .
there was a lawyer or <unk> , who was now for the rest of his life , who was able to tell people that he went to a <unk> house to save a living world , just because he was five seconds faster than i was .
well , i was the next .
the <unk> <unk> me .
he said , &quot; <unk> , you need to go into the house .
they have to go to the top of the fire , and they have to get a couple of shoes , and i have to get a couple of shoes . &quot;
i swear it .
well , not exactly what i did , but i went on -- i went down -- i went back to the <unk> , and i went down to this point that i &apos;ve been able to get out to this moment , in the bedroom , to get a couple of shoes in the bedroom to get a couple of shoes .
i know what you &apos;re thinking about , but i &apos;m not a hero .
i was walking back to the bottom , where i met on the front of my <unk> and my hometown dog .
we put our <unk> out out to <unk> , where , not surprising , his much more attention was than my own .
a couple of weeks later , the <unk> was a letter of the <unk> , where she was going to be <unk> for the <unk> of their house .
one of all of all of the things that we &apos;ve done is , somebody had a couple of shoes in front of them , somebody had a couple of shoes .
all in my job with <unk> <unk> as well , in my <unk> , i &apos;m talking about generosity and <unk> in the big scale , but i see , and i also see the <unk> and the <unk> of individual .
and you know what i learned ?
they &apos;re all important .
so , if i look at this room , and people see that you &apos;re going to have a <unk> success , or on your way , i &apos;m going to give you the question : don &apos;t wait .
don &apos;t tell a difference to make a difference in the life of a different way to make them their first million .
if you have to give something , you &apos;re going to give it this .
if you put it into a <unk> , where you go into a park in the neighborhood , you get a park in the neighborhood .
you &apos;ve got a mentor .
not every day will give us a chance to save the life of a human life , but every day , the possibility is to change one .
so they put them down ; save the shoes .
thank you .
ed <unk> : mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
i just come back from a community who knows the secret of the <unk> of humanity .
a place where women <unk> the <unk> , with sex with sex , and the game is the day -- where fun is a serious thing .
and no , it &apos;s not <unk> or san francisco .
ladies and gentlemen , their crops .
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the west of congo .
talents are together with chimpanzees our next living relationships .
that means we have a common ancestors , an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago .
well , chimpanzees are known for their <unk> .
but unfortunately , we &apos;ve got this thing <unk> in the history of human evolution .
but aid tells us the other side of the <unk> .
as chimpanzees from big , fear of <unk> teachers will be <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> females .
and that &apos;s really what comes out there , because that leads to an incredibly <unk> society , in the <unk> violence , in the <unk> violence .
but unfortunately , <unk> are the most known <unk> under the primates .
they live in the <unk> of the <unk> , and the observation is just hard to increase .
the congo is a paradox -- a country of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of the darkness itself -- the impact of a violent <unk> that has been <unk> for decades and almost so many lives , like the first world war .
it doesn &apos;t seem surprised that these destruction are going to be <unk> .
<unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> is that you couldn &apos;t even put a <unk> with the <unk> demand -- and even there we &apos;re not sure we &apos;re not sure to be honest .
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can hear a <unk> joke that the trees are <unk> .
who are these <unk> ?
we know that , as &quot; love war , &quot; because they have <unk> , but they have <unk> , even <unk> sex , with <unk> partners , and rules as conflict and social <unk> .
i don &apos;t say that was the answer to all kinds of problems -- because the life of aid is more than the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> -- how people -- love to play your life .
this is not just <unk> .
and for us , it &apos;s going to be essential for the connection of relationships and the care of tolerance .
and we learn trust and the rules of the game .
<unk> creativity and <unk> , and it &apos;s all about the <unk> of diversity -- diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of materials .
and if you look at <unk> , you see the evolutionary origins of human <unk> , dance and ritual .
play is the <unk> , which is <unk> us .
well , i don &apos;t know how you play , but i want to show you some unique photographs from the wild .
first of all , <unk> <unk> -- and i don &apos;t think about <unk> .
so here we see a young female and males in a <unk> .
look at what it does .
that might be the evolutionary origin of : &quot; she picks him in the eggs . &quot;
i think i think it &apos;s not true , not true .
yeah !
so , <unk> are <unk> , both of the <unk> than humans .
and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows -- and this video is really interesting , because it shows a new elements to play in the game -- like <unk> -- in the same time , it &apos;s a lot of fun .
but the game is a <unk> .
play is a <unk> , and it can be a lot of forms that some of you are <unk> , <unk> , curious -- maybe to discover that i &apos;ve got to discover again .
and i &apos;d like to show you , this is <unk> , a young female , and they &apos;re <unk> with water .
i think exactly how you &apos;re going to play , sometimes we &apos;re going to go back to our skin and <unk> worlds .
and it &apos;s this <unk> curiosity that allows us to work and interact and interact , and the unexpected <unk> that we form is the real <unk> of creativity .
this is just a small <unk> on the statistics that are <unk> us in our past and the present .
but it &apos;s also true a secret for our future , a future that we need to adapt to <unk> challenges , through bigger creativity and <unk> cooperation .
the secret is that the game is the key to this skills .
in other words , the game is our <unk> .
to make us successful in a <unk> world , we need to play .
but are we going to do the best from our <unk> ?
play is not silly .
it &apos;s crucial .
for demand , and humans , it doesn &apos;t matter the lives of teeth and rocks alone .
now , if it seems impossible , it &apos;s probably going to look at the <unk> .
and therefore , my <unk> , let &apos;s give us this gift of evolution , and we &apos;re going to play together this gift of evolution , and we &apos;re going to <unk> creativity .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two players , in the middle of the right day , the same day , in the same moment , the same moment , every second moment , every <unk> .
so two players , every <unk> a baby .
now , i don &apos;t want you to imagine that they &apos;re going to be <unk> , because , if you think about the entire time , you &apos;re not listening to me , you don &apos;t want to listen to me .
imagine that only for a moment .
and in this scenario , you imagine that in a case , in a case , the <unk> of a y <unk> , which is based on the x chromosome of the <unk> .
and in the other case , the <unk> is a x chromosome , which is based on the x chromosome of the <unk> .
both of them are <unk> , both <unk> .
we &apos;re going to come back to these people later .
in most of my activities , i have two <unk> .
and in a hat , i &apos;m going to come with the story of the anatomy .
i &apos;m talking about <unk> , and in this case i study , like humans with anatomy -- that &apos;s the human body , the animal body -- how they <unk> with <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , how they thought about bodies .
the other hat i &apos;ve been in my work , is the <unk> , as <unk> -- or , as i say sometimes , as <unk> <unk> -- of people who are the patient of doctors , of people who are the patient of doctors .
and in this case , i &apos;ve been working with people who have <unk> , the social norms of the question .
so , for example , i &apos;ve been working with people who are <unk> students , two people in a body .
i &apos;ve been working with people working with <unk> -- so people who were smaller than a <unk> .
and very often , i &apos;ve been working with <unk> people who are <unk> -- so people who are not going to be the average male or female <unk> .
and as an general term , we can use to use the word <unk> .
<unk> comes in many different forms .
i &apos;m just going to give you a couple of examples for the kinds of <unk> , which is not the male or female genome .
in a case , you might have someone with a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> gene of y <unk> is the <unk> , the <unk> that we &apos;ve all got to do is <unk> .
and this is why the <unk> in the <unk> stage of testosterone .
but because of this individual , it &apos;s important to recognize the testosterone , the body doesn &apos;t depend on testosterone .
and this is called <unk> .
so much testosterone , but no reaction on it .
and as a consequence , the body is more likely to be the typical female events .
when the child &apos;s born , it looks like a girl .
she &apos;s a girl . she &apos;s going to be <unk> as girls .
but it doesn &apos;t take it up until them and they grow their <unk> , and they &apos;re growing up , but it doesn &apos;t get their time until someone comes out there &apos;s a little bit different .
and they make a couple of tests and find out that they are more than <unk> and <unk> , in fact that they have a y chromosome .
it &apos;s important to understand that you could be able to think of this person &apos;s person , but they &apos;re not really .
women , like men , in our body , is that you &apos;re called <unk> .
they &apos;re in the <unk> part of our body .
and the <unk> are <unk> , which is <unk> hormones .
most of women , as i -- i think i don &apos;t believe my real wife -- i don &apos;t know my real <unk> , but i think i probably &apos;ve probably got the headline -- most women like me to talk about <unk> .
we produce <unk> , and we &apos;re talking about <unk> .
and the result is that somebody like me was actually a brain that was <unk> , as a woman who was born , as a woman who was born with <unk> , and a <unk> .
so , it &apos;s really complicated ; <unk> is not only in the middle of the spectrum of gender -- in some ways , in a sense , you can be aware of the entire amount of bandwidth .
now , one example : a few years ago , i got the name of a 19 years ago , who was as young as young as young , he had a friend , he had sex with his girlfriend , in life as a man , and he had just found that he had <unk> .
he had an extreme form of a <unk> <unk> .
he has <unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> , his <unk> was so strong that they &apos;ve created a male <unk> .
and as a result , it was <unk> , the brain was <unk> , his brain was <unk> the <unk> male .
and when he was born , he looked like a boy -- nobody had something .
and only when he was 19 years old , he got enough medical problems , in fact , because he &apos;s <unk> <unk> , that the doctors found that the doctors had found that he was in the internal female .
all right , just a beautiful example of <unk> <unk> .
some people with <unk> chromosomes , creating something called <unk> , which is <unk> by <unk> <unk> .
we don &apos;t know why that happens .
and so it &apos;s going to be in many different ways of <unk> in many different ways .
the reason why children are in this kind of body -- it &apos;s <unk> or <unk> twins , it &apos;s <unk> -- from surgeons often to get to the norm , is not because this is about their physical health care of advantage .
in many cases , these people are completely healthy .
the reason for you often have different kinds of surgery , because they &apos;re going to be made of our social categories .
in fact , our system is based on the idea that a certain <unk> form is associated with a specific identity .
so we &apos;ve got the concept that a woman is going to have to be able to have a female identity ; a black person means to have a african anatomy in terms of their own history .
so we have this awful <unk> idea .
and if we &apos;re living with a body , which is actually something very different to us , ironically , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing with this <unk> .
so we &apos;ve got a lot of romantic ideas about <unk> .
and our nation is really based on a very brilliant concept of <unk> .
now , you can imagine how amazing it is , when kids are born , that &apos;s two people in a body .
where i &apos;ve heard of the most amazing idea in the last time , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> last year , who was asked to be asked by the <unk> <unk> in berlin .
many journalists <unk> me with the question , &quot; what are you going to do , &quot; what test you &apos;re going to tell us is whether <unk> <unk> female car or male ? &quot;
and i had to explain the journalists that there doesn &apos;t have this test .
we now know that gender is complicated enough that we have to say that nature is going to have to say that nature is going through the male and female , or between the male and <unk> and female and female and <unk> , we &apos;re doing this line as well .
so we have this kind of situation where the way that we &apos;re going to use our science is that these categories that we have to say that these categories that we had to think of <unk> <unk> , which is very simple <unk> to create <unk> <unk> , much more <unk> than we said .
and that &apos;s not just in terms of gender .
it &apos;s also <unk> , which is as much more complicated than what we &apos;re doing as much more complicated than our <unk> .
in our <unk> , we &apos;re in all sorts of <unk> areas .
for example , for example , the fact is that we have at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we going to start with the fact that we &apos;re just going to be different by a few <unk> ?
while we &apos;re always going back to our science , we get increasingly increasingly in a middle of the <unk> , where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that we &apos;ve probably had to be very simple .
we see that in all kinds of parts of human life .
one of the areas that we see that we can see in our today , in our technology , in the world today , in the united states , are the <unk> of the beginning and the end of life .
we &apos;ve got hard conversations about what &apos;s going to be a body for people , so he &apos;s going to have a different right way to deal with <unk> life .
we &apos;ve been very difficult today -- maybe not as public , like in medicine -- about the question when someone &apos;s dead .
our ancestors had never been so hard to fight with the question when someone was dead .
you &apos;ve got somebody else in the nose , and when they moved to the nose , they didn &apos;t fly them .
if you don &apos;t move out , you &apos;re going to get it out .
but today we &apos;re in a situation where we &apos;re going to take people <unk> organs , and they &apos;re going to give them other people .
and as a result , we put ourselves on the battle with the really hard question when someone &apos;s dead , and that brings us into a really hard way that we &apos;re not so simple , in which we &apos;re not so simple , in which we &apos;re not as simple categories .
now , you might imagine that the whole <unk> of categories would be really happy to me .
i &apos;m <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> people with extraordinary bodies , but i have to say , it makes me nervous .
and to understand that these categories are really much <unk> than we thought , it doesn &apos;t work me .
and it doesn &apos;t get me in terms of thinking about democracy .
so to tell you about this <unk> , i &apos;ve got to end up because i &apos;ve got a big fan of <unk> .
i know that they were <unk> , i know that they were <unk> , but they were great .
i think that they were so <unk> and strong , and so radical , in which they did me all over the few years , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s not because of music that &apos;s completely forgotten .
it &apos;s because of what we &apos;re doing with the <unk> .
the <unk> were from my view of my view , the original <unk> activists , and that &apos;s why .
what it was <unk> was a <unk> concept , and they took it through a different , which was radical and beautiful , and 200 years for us .
and as you all remember , our <unk> was the concept of <unk> , and the bones that was in the bottom of a very simple concept of anatomy .
the <unk> of the old world had no concept based on dna , but they had a concept of <unk> .
they had a concept of blue blood .
they were the notion that people who had political power , that political power had to have this political power , because of the head of the left to father , and so forth .
now , the <unk> <unk> made this idea , and they took them through a new <unk> concept , and this concept said that all people have been able to create .
they <unk> the <unk> , and decided that the <unk> are seen the <unk> , not the difference , and that was very radical .
now , they made that part , because it was part of a <unk> system , in the two things in the two things .
the democracy grew up , but in the same time , the science grew up .
if you look at the story of the <unk> , that many of you are very interested in science , and they were interested in a concept of a <unk> world .
they went out of <unk> <unk> , and <unk> things like a <unk> concept of power , coming back , where the chemicals on a very <unk> , is based on <unk> .
they moved to a <unk> concept .
and if you look at the <unk> , you &apos;re talking about nature and the god of nature .
they don &apos;t talk about god and the nature of god .
they talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
and as part of it , they made us a concept that was <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what they &apos;ve done in really wonderful ways to deal with the future rights .
they didn &apos;t think about that , but what they &apos;ve done for us was great .
so what happened for years ?
for example , women used to have women <unk> , the concept of <unk> , the concept of <unk> , who says that <unk> is important than the <unk> difference , and they said , &quot; that we should have a <unk> , and that &apos;s right to get the <unk> , &quot; etc . , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot;
and women <unk> the successful .
next year , the successful civil civil war , where we looked at people like <unk> <unk> , who <unk> it , &quot; am i not a woman ? &quot;
we find men in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , who says , &quot; i &apos;m a man . &quot;
again , people have different blood blood vessels that are <unk> on <unk> differences , again , successful , successful .
we see the same thing on the <unk> .
of course , the problem is that , and we &apos;re starting to look at all the <unk> , we have to start to imagine why we &apos;re going to use certain <unk> .
well , you know , i want to use certain <unk> , <unk> , in our culture .
so , i want to give you the same right thing to give you the same right thing as a person .
i don &apos;t want to tell you that we should get out of the anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to say that <unk> is going to have the right thing to give their employees to sex or marry to marry .
so there are some <unk> <unk> who are doing for me to make sense , and we know , i think i should keep .
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is , and why we eat them , and whether it &apos;s useful .
so let &apos;s start back to these two creatures that are <unk> to the beginning of the talk .
we have two creatures , both in the middle of the middle of the same day .
so let &apos;s imagine that one of them , mary , three months <unk> was born , so she was born at the one of the age of 1980 .
<unk> , on the other side , is going to be born to <unk> , so he &apos;s born at a march of 1980 .
it &apos;s because of the fact that 1980 was born three months ago , they &apos;re going to be born all sorts of two months ago , <unk> -- that &apos;s right to have sex for sex that are right to drink .
i don &apos;t have to wait for all this , not because it &apos;s actually a different biological age , only because of the <unk> of his birth .
we &apos;re still able to find other ways of what your rights are .
<unk> , because you realize it &apos;s the male -- although i don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s <unk> -- because you don &apos;t tell you that he &apos;s the male , it &apos;s going to be moved to what mandela don &apos;t have to worry about .
in the same time , i can &apos;t see the same thing right now in the same states , which is <unk> in all states , and it &apos;s right to marry it .
<unk> can marry in every state of a woman , but mandela can only marry a woman today in a few states .
so , we &apos;ve got these <unk> <unk> categories that are <unk> in many ways and <unk> .
and for me , the question is : what are we going to do , because our science is doing this progress in the field of the anatomy that we need to be able to be able to say that a democracy that is based on anatomy .
i don &apos;t want to give the science of science , but the same time , sometimes it feels like the science is doing it .
so what are we going to do ?
it seems like our culture is a kind of <unk> <unk> : &quot; well , we need to make a line like this , so we &apos;re going to do it somewhere else . &quot;
but a lot of people <unk> in a very strange position .
so , for example , texas , in one point , i decided to marry a man , that you don &apos;t have <unk> chromosome , and a woman says that you &apos;ve got a <unk> chromosome .
now , in practice , people don &apos;t have to go on their <unk> .
but it &apos;s also very bizarre , because of the story i told you about the <unk> .
if we look at one of modern democracy , dr. martin luther king , he tells us , &quot; i &apos;ve got a dream of &quot; a kind of solution . &quot;
he says we should not have people like &quot; your blood skin , but after the property of your character , &quot; and that &apos;s how about anatomy .
and i want to say , &quot; yes , that sounds like a really good idea . &quot;
but how do you do that in practice ?
how do you <unk> people from their <unk> ?
and i also want to point out that i &apos;m not sure that we &apos;re supposed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a series of golden beings that probably don &apos;t want to earn a series of golden <unk> , which is probably the benefits that i know .
i want to give out that i &apos;ve probably got some of the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> choices to meet their sexual relationships than some <unk> that i know .
so how are we going to ask the question for the properties of the character ?
it turns out as really hard .
and one part of me wonder , what if the content of a personality would be something that would be <unk> in the future -- is to be able to be able to be able to be able to be done ?
do we really want to go into this direction ?
i &apos;m not sure where we &apos;re going to go .
so what i know is that it seems really important to think about the idea that the united states is in terms of thinking about how to do democracy .
in our efforts , democracy , we &apos;ve done our thing right now , and i think we would do that in the future of the future .
we don &apos;t have the situation , like , for example , in iran , where a man who &apos;s <unk> to other men is going to be <unk> by death , because it &apos;s ready to be <unk> , in which case he can stay in life .
the way we don &apos;t exist with us .
i &apos;m happy to say that we don &apos;t have these states -- a surgeon with which i was talking about a few years ago , which was a couple of <unk> students who had a couple of <unk> twins to get them to make them a name .
but when i said to him , and he asked him why he made these observations -- it was a <unk> surgeries -- was his answer that in his country , these kids would be treated very bad , and therefore he had to do it .
i said to him , &quot; well , you have political <unk> , rather than a operation to get them ? &quot;
the united states offer incredible ways to allow people to be the ones that they are , without going to change the state of the brain .
so i think we need to be <unk> .
all right , just to finish , i want to notice that i &apos;ve talked a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibility of how democracy could look like democracy , or looked like , if we had the mothers more involved .
and i want to say something that &apos;s a series of a little bit radical , and i think there might be different kinds of insights that are about different species of the anatomy , <unk> , <unk> when people use a <unk> .
since years , because i &apos;ve been interested in <unk> , i &apos;ve also been interested in the area of <unk> .
and one of the things that i really found interesting is the difference between men and women in terms of how they think and in the world .
what we &apos;ve learned from <unk> studies is that women , in average -- not every one , but in the average -- more complex social relationships and the way for people who are in the group of the group , very much attention .
and therefore , if we think about that , we have a interesting situation that we have .
in years ago , when i was a friend , i asked myself one of my <unk> , who was my interest in feminism -- i looked at me as a <unk> , so that &apos;s a really strange question .
he said , &quot; tell me what &apos;s the <unk> female . &quot;
and i thought , &quot; well , this is the <unk> question i &apos;ve ever heard .
in feminism , it &apos;s talking about gender of gender , so that &apos;s why it &apos;s not different different .
but the more i thought about his question , so more , i thought that there might be something <unk> in feminism .
this is going to be like , it could be something like , in average , where female brains are different from the male , which is <unk> for <unk> social relationships , and <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , in fact , the most important thing that we were doing is to figure out how individuals in the state of the state , it &apos;s possible that if we were more <unk> in this concept , we &apos;re getting more <unk> , not just how to protect them , but how we can worry for each other .
and maybe it &apos;s where we have to go into the future , if we &apos;re talking democracy about anatomy -- less about the individual body , to think about the individual body , to think more about relationships , and more about relationships .
so that , if we &apos;re trying to try to make a <unk> connection , we think about what we can do for each other .
thank you .
i &apos;m <unk> , and this is my suitcase .
but before i show you , what i &apos;m going to do is i &apos;m going to do a very specific <unk> , and this is : i &apos;m obsessed with <unk> .
i love it to every chance to have a different <unk> to get a <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;m also going to photograph in the last time to photograph , and in the last time , and in the last time .
but i don &apos;t buy any new .
i &apos;m going to get all my clothes from the second hand in <unk> and <unk> .
ooh , thank you .
<unk> allows me to reduce the influence of my <unk> on the environment , and also , in my wallet .
i &apos;m going to meet all sorts of great people ; my dollar vaccine for usually a good purpose ; i see quite unique ; and it makes it <unk> to my very personal <unk> .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it my size ?
can i like the color ?
is it less than 20 dollars ?
if all the answers is , i feel , i feel like i won .
i come back to my suitcase , and tell you what i &apos;ve got to tell for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does someone do with so many <unk> ?
so i &apos;m going to show you right now what i &apos;ve brought .
i &apos;ve brought seven and a couple of <unk> , and that &apos;s all .
<unk> for exactly a week , all the things i &apos;ve done in my suitcase .
i &apos;ve been <unk> that i &apos;d like to have anything else i &apos;d like to have to find , if i was just going to be able to look at bars .
and because they didn &apos;t heard about me as the woman who came here at ted in their underwear -- that &apos;s what i found , i found a couple of things .
and i don &apos;t want to show you my <unk> for this week .
is that good ?
while i &apos;m doing this , i &apos;m going to give you some of the lessons that i think whether you don &apos;t believe it or not , from these <unk> , nothing new .
let &apos;s start with sunday .
i call this <unk> <unk> .
you don &apos;t have to spend a lot of money .
you can almost look at less than 50 dollars .
this whole <unk> , including the <unk> , and it was the most expensive piece that i had to get the most expensive piece of this whole week , and it was the most important piece that i &apos;ve taken in this whole week .
fg : color is something strange .
it &apos;s almost <unk> impossible to be bad <unk> if you &apos;re <unk> pants .
if you &apos;re happy , you take other happy people .
in the time , it &apos;s going to be completely <unk> .
i spent a lot of time in my life , trying to be trying to be able to fix myself , and i was able to adapt to the same time .
you just just know who they are .
if you &apos;re surrounded with the right people , you &apos;re not just understanding it , you &apos;re going to be able to feel .
ph : don &apos;t take your own child .
sometimes i want to ask people , i looked like , as if i &apos;m going to play , or that i remember it .
i want to leave and say , &quot; thank you . &quot; thank you . &quot;
nm : confidence is the key .
if you think you look at something good , it &apos;s almost safe .
and if you think you don &apos;t look good , you probably don &apos;t have it right now .
i grew up with a mother who taught me the day for day .
but only when i was 30 , i really understood what that means .
and i &apos;m going to give you the short thing for you .
if you believe that they &apos;re inside , and there &apos;s a wonderful person , there &apos;s nothing that you can &apos;t wear .
so there &apos;s no excuse for somebody here in this audience .
we should be able to be able to <unk> everything we want .
thank you .
collaborator : a universal truth -- five words : golden <unk> <unk> to everything .
and finally , obesity : a own , unique , healthy form , is a great way to tell the world a little bit about to tell the world without saying a word .
it was always inspired to me , and i noticed that if in this week , people came up to me , just because of what i had was , and i had great conversations .
obviously , it &apos;s not going to be <unk> in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i &apos;m going to send it all back .
because the lesson i &apos;m trying to learn about this week is that it &apos;s okay .
i don &apos;t have to get this stuff out of this thing , because the same thing is going to be in the corner , it &apos;s going to be a different <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which only for me , if i have a little love in the heart , and it &apos;s looking for it .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good day , all together .
i &apos;ve got something that i want to show you .
think about this as <unk> , as a <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s what we call in our lab , <unk> design .
let me tell you a little bit about this .
now , if you take this image -- i &apos;m originally <unk> , and every boy in italy , with this image in his room , and the reason i &apos;m going to show you is that i &apos;m going to show you this in the formula one in the morning one in the last few decades .
for some time , it was so that if you wanted to win a formula , they took their budget , and they put their money on a good driver , and a good car .
and if the car and the driver and the driver was good enough , they won the race .
now today , you need to win if you want to win a race , in fact something like this one -- something like this one -- something like this one -- something like the car in real time , the information of the surface , and then it &apos;s the way to use this car to send decisions and bring things into real time as information .
this is what they would call , in <unk> , a <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s a system that &apos;s from two parts -- a <unk> part and a <unk> .
what &apos;s interesting about today is the <unk> start in our lives .
our cities were living in the last few years , just with networks and electronics .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
and as a computer in the free , they start to react to other ways , they &apos;re going to be aware of the same way .
if we <unk> cities , it &apos;s actually a big thing .
by the way , i want to say that cities are only two percent of the surface of the earth , but 50 percent of the world population exists .
they &apos;re 75 percent of the <unk> -- to get to 80 percent of co2 emissions .
so if we do something with the cities , it &apos;s a big thing .
over the cities , all of this looks like this , and you &apos;re going to be able to get in different parts of the daily life .
this is from an exhibition , the <unk> <unk> for moma later in the year , during the summer of summer .
it &apos;s called &quot; i mean . &quot;
now , all of our objects , our environment , are starting to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if every atom is out there , there is a sensor , a sensor and a <unk> .
and this is changing the interaction of the interaction that we have people from our environment .
in a way , it &apos;s almost like the old dream of joshua ...
you know , when he &apos;s called the literature , it &apos;s called that he took the hammer , and he took him on moses , and it was , in fact , you can still see a little bit <unk> -- and i said , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> ? why don &apos;t you talk ? &quot;
now , today , our environment starts for the first time to answer us .
i &apos;m just going to show you some examples -- again , with the idea of the idea of our environment and understand .
let &apos;s start with what happens .
so the first project i &apos;d like to imagine is actually one of the first of our <unk> .
it was made in italy a half years ago in italy .
and what we &apos;ve done was in fact was actually a new way to use a new kind of network that was used on the world -- that &apos;s a <unk> -- and malaria and <unk> information from this network that are going to be taken from the interface to understand how the city works .
summer was a happier summer -- 2006 .
it was like italy <unk> the <unk> .
some of you will remember , it was as italy in france to france , and then at the end of the end , the <unk> .
and it doesn &apos;t have italy at the end .
now you see what happened on that day , just at the most of the activity that happens in the network .
here you see the city .
you see in the middle of the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> .
the morning , the game .
you see the <unk> .
back afternoon , people here , and there , the <unk> <unk> and moving .
the game starts on -- forget .
sweden is a <unk> . kenya is a <unk> .
<unk> , the people are doing a short call , go to the toilet .
second <unk> . the end of normal <unk> .
secondly , second . second .
<unk> , in a moment of <unk> .
newspapers , yeah . yeah .
well , in this night , all of the time , all of the <unk> to celebrate .
they looked at the big problem .
so the next day , all the time in the center of the <unk> and the prime minister and the prime minister was to meet the same time .
and then all down .
and you see the image of the place of <unk> , where , since the <unk> time , people are trying to celebrate -- to get a big party , and you see the truth on the end of the day .
well , this is just a example of how we can feel the city , in a way of how we could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it for a couple of years ago .
again , there &apos;s another example of understanding : this is not about people , but it &apos;s about things that we use and consume .
now , today we know about where our stuff comes out .
this is a map that &apos;s a map that shows you all the <unk> , which is a mac computer , how they came together .
but we just know about where the stuff is going to go .
so we &apos;ve actually created some small machines to look at the garbage while he &apos;s going through the system that goes through the system .
so we &apos;ve started with some volunteers who helped us have more than a year ago in seattle , to <unk> things that they have <unk> -- different species of things like you can see -- things that you can see things that they &apos;re doing .
then we &apos;ve got the small <unk> , the little <unk> , on the garbage , and i started to explore it .
here are the results that we &apos;ve just done .
journalists ... ...
after a week .
with this information , we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system .
we can do the same things in the fact that we can do with less energy .
the data was not available before .
but this is what happens to a lot of <unk> and more complicated things .
the other thing is that we believe that if we look at every day that the cup that we &apos;re looking at is not easy , not easy , it &apos;s still in the planet .
and the <unk> that we &apos;re going to take every day there &apos;s still there .
and if we would show the people , we can use a behavior of behavior .
so this is the reason for this project .
my colleague in my colleague , <unk> <unk> , could give you a lot more different about that , and the many other wonderful things that you can tell to see is , but i &apos;d like to talk to the second part that we &apos;re at the beginning , and that &apos;s the <unk> of our environment .
and the first project is something that we &apos;ve done a few years ago in <unk> , spain .
it started with a question of <unk> , who came to us and said that spain and <unk> was a nice tradition to use public places as part of the architecture .
and the question was : how could you do technology , new technology ?
and one of the ideas that i &apos;ve been doing in a <unk> <unk> was , you know , you can imagine this <unk> , and the <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , and they &apos;re looking at it .
they &apos;re going to be able to make a <unk> of water <unk> from water .
if these <unk> <unk> , you can write that , you can write patterns , images , text <unk> .
and you can move to him , and it will open up , and it &apos;s going to be open to <unk> , as you can see on this image .
well , we &apos;ve done the mayor <unk> .
it was very like him .
and we took the assignment to design a building in the <unk> of the temple .
we called it to the digital water .
the whole building was from water .
there is no doors or windows , but if you move to him , it will open it up , and you &apos;re going to go into it .
the roof was also <unk> with water .
and if it &apos;s <unk> , if you want to increase the <unk> , you can even put the roof down .
or you could look at the building and the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , these days , if you <unk> the roof , you get pictures of people who were there and say , &quot; you &apos;ve broken the building . &quot;
no , they &apos;re not destroyed the building , it &apos;s just like that architecture is almost <unk> .
here you see what the building works .
you see the person who &apos;s going to look at what happens in the inside .
and here you see me when i tried to test the sensors that <unk> the water , not going to be <unk> .
well , i should tell you what one night happened to work as all sensors .
but in fact , it was a lot more fun .
every children from <unk> came to the building , because the way they were in the building was different .
not more than a building that will open up to you , but a building that was still <unk> and holes in the water , you had to be able to go down without <unk> .
and that was , for us , very exciting , because as architects , engineers , as designers , we &apos;re always thinking about how people do the things that we make things that we &apos;re doing .
but the reality is always extraordinary .
and this is the nice thing to create things that will be used to be used and interact with people .
here &apos;s a picture of the building with the physical <unk> , the <unk> of water and the <unk> .
and this is what led us to think about the following project that i &apos;m going to show you now .
imagine that <unk> could actually happen to fly .
imagine , you could have small doors who fly through the air , and every one of them with a little <unk> with <unk> light -- almost as a cloud that can move through the space .
here &apos;s the video .
imagine a door , like the ones that you &apos;ve seen before you &apos;ve seen about the other thing that you &apos;ve seen with other , completely <unk> .
you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of <unk> screen or protocell , like this -- a <unk> form in two dimensions .
or <unk> , but in three dimensions , which is what changes the light , not the position of <unk> .
you can play with different species .
imagine the screen could just be able to be in different <unk> or females , in different <unk> .
but then it could be just a 3d cloud of <unk> , where they can go through , and they can go through that they can see them from many , many directions .
here you can see a real <unk> , the <unk> of how to form a <unk> <unk> .
if you look at the light , it looks like this . so just like we &apos;ve seen it before .
imagine that every single one of people will be <unk> .
it could have a sign that every single <unk> that comes from people , from the movements of people or so on .
i want to show you some of you here .
we &apos;ve been working with <unk> <unk> , one of the best <unk> of our time -- the <unk> institute in new york and the <unk> in the <unk> -- we &apos;ve taken his movements in 3d to use them as a <unk> for the <unk> .
here you see <unk> dance .
on the left side side , you see the <unk> , the different <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> and a <unk> , and a <unk> .
this is how you can understand the whole movement .
you can do that all the time .
but then , if we have all the <unk> , you can play with this , and you can play with color motion and <unk> .
this is how we want to use a kind of <unk> for the <unk> .
i want to show you the latest project that we &apos;re working on .
it &apos;s something that we &apos;re working for the olympic games in london .
it &apos;s called the cloud -- the cloud .
and the idea is , imagine , imagine that we &apos;re going to be able to do something to do something and change the environment -- almost as something that we call it , <unk> <unk> as you move to a <unk> , but with a cloud .
imagine that everybody can give you a little <unk> for a <unk> .
and i think that the remarkable thing about the same last couple of years , the last couple of decades is that we are made from a physical world to create a digital world .
this has all of us know , knowledge , and it makes it through the internet .
today , we can see for the first time -- and the campaign obama showed that -- can we see from the digital world , from the <unk> forces of the networks of the physical world .
that can be in our case that we use it to create and create a symbol .
that means something that &apos;s built in the city .
but morning , it can be able to ask us the next challenges -- think of the climate change or the co2 emissions -- how can we move from the digital world to change the physical world .
so the idea is that we actually have the people in which they &apos;re doing things together that they &apos;re doing things together .
the cloud is back to a cloud of <unk> , in the same way as a real cloud is a cloud of particles .
and these particles are water , while our cloud is a cloud of <unk> .
it &apos;s a physical building in london , but with <unk> .
they can move in the inside and different kinds of experiences .
you can actually look at it from the bottom , the most important moments for <unk> bush and only share , and it &apos;s the way of the connection to the community .
so both , the physical cloud in the sky , and something on the top of you can go on , like university &apos;s new <unk> .
you can walk .
and a kind of digital <unk> in night -- but as <unk> , a new kind of experience of experience for everybody who wants to go to the top .
thank you .
as artists , i &apos;m very important in the context .
and in my work , i &apos;m trying to teach people that people are separate from nature , and that all is connected to each other .
the first time i was about almost 10 years ago in antarctica , where i saw my first <unk> .
i &apos;ve got <unk> awe .
my heart <unk> , i was <unk> , while i was trying to tell you what i was .
the <unk> to me over the <unk> of almost 60 feet from the water , and i could only wonder that that was a <unk> on one another year , year for year .
<unk> are born as a team of a <unk> , or by <unk> , <unk> .
every <unk> has its own individual personality .
they are living in the <unk> way with their surroundings and their experience .
some of them are going to give up and <unk> to the best end , as other as other , as other as other as other , and there is <unk> passion .
if you look at a mosque , you &apos;re easy to think that they are isolated , apart and alone , as we see people often see us .
but the truth is far out of it .
as a mosque , <unk> , i <unk> his <unk> atmosphere .
and in the center of <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> drinking water , which is a lot of living life .
i &apos;m going to go to my photographs of this <unk> , as if i make portraits of my ancestors , in the consciousness that they exist in these individual moments from this way , and never be so different .
it &apos;s not death when it rains ; it &apos;s not the end , but it &apos;s not the end , but a <unk> of their <unk> .
one part of the ice in the <unk> that i have <unk> is very young -- a few thousand years old .
and a part of the ice is more than 100,000 years old .
the last images i &apos;d like to show you to show a <unk> that i &apos;d like to show up in the galapagos in greenland .
in fact , you &apos;re actually going to be <unk> by a <unk> iceberg .
here you see it now .
on the left side side , you see a little boat .
this is about five feet long .
please look at the shape of the iceberg and where it &apos;s on the <unk> .
and you can see here , he &apos;s beginning to go , and the boat has moved to the other side , the man is there .
this is the average size of a <unk> .
he <unk> about 120 feet from the water , or 40 meters .
and this video is in real time .
and just like this , it shows you a different side of his personality .
thank you .
my life is really extraordinary worried about the work of some amazing projects .
but in the memes i &apos;ve ever worked , it was about this guy .
his name is <unk> .
<unk> was one of the leading <unk> of the 80s .
then , one day , he came back from coming back and said , &quot; <unk> , my legs <unk> . &quot;
and that was the <unk> of that .
<unk> is completely paralyzed today .
he can only use his eyes .
i was going to get him to it .
so i &apos;ve got a company that design and animations , and so i think it &apos;s not a complex part of what we know in the art of the art and look at .
so we decided , tony -- <unk> -- and to support his thing .
i met with his father and his brother and he said , &quot; we &apos;re going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with that ? &quot;
and his brother said , &quot; i just want to talk to tony .
i just want to go back to him , and i said , &quot; well , i &apos;m not -- i saw stephen hawking -- i don &apos;t have all the <unk> people to communicate with these devices ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; no , only if you heard to higher <unk> and a remarkable insurance , you can really do that .
a lot of people are using these devices . &quot;
and i said , &quot; how do you think about it ? &quot;
would anyone see the film &quot; <unk> and <unk> ?
this is how they communicate -- so they go to your fingers .
i <unk> , &quot; very <unk> , how can that be ? &quot;
so i came up with the need , just just a piece , and instead , i asked a check from which i didn &apos;t have the <unk> idea of how i was supposed to <unk> him .
i went to the place , and i saw his brother and his father , and his father -- &quot; well , my proposal is : tony is going to talk to him a device , and we &apos;re going to find a way to find that he can make his art .
because it &apos;s a <unk> that someone who is doing all this , it can &apos;t communicate . &quot;
so i talked about a few months later in a conference .
i met these people from <unk> , <unk> research lab , and they have a technology that allows them to get a light on each other , and then you have a technology that allows you to draw light on each other .
so they &apos;re going to go around and make <unk> like this .
they say all the things that are sitting there on the top , a life of life .
it starts with the <unk> , then the <unk> , after the <unk> , and finally , people are actually doing art .
but there was always a life in their colleagues .
so i went home and went home with my wife , and we told her , and we thought , &quot; well , second , if there &apos;s this technology that you can use your eyes to control things , then we should find a way that the <unk> can use a <unk> , so that he could do it again . &quot;
that was the beginning of the journey .
and over two years later , a year later , a year later , after a lot of organization and a lot of things , we &apos;ve done some things .
first of all , we have <unk> the door of the doors , and they actually have to get a device that we can communicate with -- a brother <unk> .
that was incredible .
and he &apos;s really extremely funny -- i call him <unk> , because you talk to him , or you get a email , and you think , &quot; i &apos;m so <unk> , this guy is incredible . &quot;
and we &apos;ve got seven <unk> from the entire world -- literally from all of all of the edges of the world -- to us at home .
my wife , my kids , and i went to the garage , and this <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> our house .
many of our friends thought that we were beautiful stupid to do that , and that we <unk> , and all the images on the walls would be <unk> .
but for about two weeks ago , we went to <unk> , we went to the <unk> in <unk> , my kids were working on , my dog , and we built this .
it &apos;s called <unk> , and you can see the description .
this is a cheap <unk> that we bought on the <unk> of the <unk> , something <unk> and a couple of things from the <unk> and the <unk> .
we took a <unk> , they have <unk> , they have <unk> , and now we have a device that is free , and now we have a device that is free , we can use it to use the code for free , the software you can use for free .
so we &apos;ve got a device that &apos;s completely free from the script .
no insurance can be <unk> .
not a hospital .
now , you can actually communicate alone with your eyes or draw .
thank you .
thank you very much , that was incredible .
so at the end of the two weeks , we went back to <unk> room .
i love this image because it &apos;s the room of somebody else and this is his room .
there &apos;s all of these <unk> <unk> .
and after about a year of planning , two weeks ago , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> at the first time after seven years after seven years .
and this is an amazing image , because this is his life , and he sees about his life .
we put his bed , so he can see that he can see .
we &apos;ve got a narrative from a wall against a wall of the <unk> in the hospital .
and he came back to the first time , in the <unk> of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what &apos;s a feeling that was in the <unk> .
so , we had to have to <unk> , we had to be able to be able to <unk> , and so we thought , as a part of the <unk> , we felt like a part of the <unk> .
so , at the end , he took us a email with this content : &quot; for the first time for seven years ago , i &apos;ve done something .
i got the feeling , i was going to go under the water , and finally , somebody back to the bottom and my head , that i can breathe . &quot;
isn &apos;t that amazing ?
this is something like our <unk> .
this is what we &apos;re going to do in the <unk> , and it allows us to develop us .
and we &apos;ve got to improve a lot of this device .
it &apos;s an amazing device , but it comes from a <unk> second .
and somebody who has a <unk> potential to make a lot more .
so we &apos;re going to figure out how to make it better , faster and stronger .
since this time , we &apos;ve got all sorts of <unk> .
we &apos;ve won a couple of prices .
think about it , it &apos;s free , no one of us against us .
it comes from our own pockets .
so it was , &quot; oh , this is fantastic . &quot; oh , that &apos;s fantastic . &quot;
roy <unk> : and then in december , in december , we &apos;ve been fascinated with the <unk> , as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010 , which was really great .
the <unk> of this is -- and that &apos;s the <unk> of the entire circle -- that it &apos;s this april , at <unk> <unk> in the city of los angeles , a exhibition is going to be a exhibition called &quot; kind of the <unk> of the <unk> . &quot;
and there &apos;s probably so pretty much the most <unk> <unk> of the <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> -- all these guys are going to be there .
<unk> is going to be part of the show , which is pretty scary .
so what i think is that if you see something that &apos;s impossible , it &apos;s possible , then it &apos;s possible .
all in this room was impossible -- this stage , this computer , this microphone , this iphone , the <unk> -- everything was impossible .
make it possible -- all of you here .
i &apos;m not a programmer , and had never been able to do something with <unk> , but i just took a little bit , and i &apos;m just going to spread me with amazing people , so we could put together something on the legs .
and this question should everyone come out of you , and that &apos;s about every single day that you &apos;ve got to do something that has to be done . if not , when then , if ? and if i don &apos;t know who ? and if i don &apos;t know who ?
thank you .
so , i write for children , and i &apos;ve probably probably been <unk> <unk> .
and i don &apos;t tell people that i don &apos;t want to come out like a scientist .
you can have a farmer , or in leather , but no one has ever met farmers .
today , i want to tell you about circles and <unk> .
well , it turns out , it &apos;s really something that you find , because you &apos;ve got to get it somewhere else .
you &apos;re going to go to the block and take it out as an octopus .
this is a painting of a circle .
one of my friends had done it -- richard <unk> .
it &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that i want to tell you today .
my circle started in the &apos; 60s in the &apos; &apos; 60s in <unk> , florida , where i was the <unk> .
i was the left that every week in the <unk> of green and blue , until a teacher was killed my life .
they were working with my life by telling me the toilet in the <unk> .
that &apos;s what they did .
she did this three years .
and i had to get out of the city .
i had a thumb , i had 85 dollars , and it started me to san francisco in california -- i found a tone -- and at the time in the 80s , i found it really important to do a work in <unk> .
about three or four years ago , i got a call from this teacher called a call from this teacher , who said , &quot; i need to see you .
i &apos;m happy that we never learned as adults know than adults know .
can you come back to ohio , and please come together with the guy who i know that you &apos;ve seen it .
and i &apos;d like to mention that i have <unk> , and that i want you to do . &quot;
now , the next day we were in california .
we looked at them , we were laughing , and we knew that they had to be in <unk> .
we found one for them , we brought them out , and we had to get them out of them , and we gave them eight , because it was needed to be , and we had eight , because it was needed .
it was something that we knew to do .
and just as the woman who wanted me to learn as adults , trying to learn me , she turned out to a box full of <unk> , and it was in my hands .
what happened was that the circle was broken , it was a circle -- and the <unk> of that i &apos;ve talked about .
the <unk> is that death is a part of life .
she had saved my life , and my partner and i live with her .
and you know , this part of life needs to need everything of the rest of life .
he takes truth and beauty , and i &apos;m so happy that this is so often mentioned today .
he takes the same thing -- he would need to love , love and joy , and it &apos;s about to give us these things .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion , while you go to 1,000 feet away .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine an engine , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
that sounds like fear <unk> .
well , i had a unique place on this day , and i was sitting on <unk> .
i was the only thing that i could talk to the <unk> .
so i looked at the same thing , and they said , &quot; no problem , we &apos;ve heard a couple of birds . &quot;
the pilot had been <unk> , and we didn &apos;t have been so far away .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things later happened .
the pilot <unk> the machine after the <unk> river .
that &apos;s probably not the route .
he <unk> the <unk> .
imagine a <unk> airplane .
and then he said three words -- the <unk> words i &apos;ve ever heard .
he says , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i didn &apos;t have to talk about the <unk> .
i was able to see it in your eyes , there was <unk> , the life was to end .
i want to tell you three things that i learned about that day .
i learned that in a moment , it &apos;s different .
we &apos;ve got these <unk> , we have these things that we want to do in life , and i thought about all the people i wanted to get a hand , and i didn &apos;t do it , all the <unk> that i wanted to do , all the experience that i wanted to do and never do .
while i thought about it later , i was a verb , which is , &quot; i don &apos;t do bad <unk> . &quot;
because if the wine is so much , and the person is there , then i get it .
i never want to do something else in life .
and this perspective , this goal , this goal , has really changed my life .
the second thing i learned about this day -- and that was when we found the george washington bridge , so pretty much about <unk> -- because i thought , man , there &apos;s one thing that i &apos;m really <unk> .
i had a good life .
in my own humanity and with my mistakes , i <unk> to be better to become better in all of what i <unk> .
but in my humanity , i &apos;ve got to have my <unk> space .
and i <unk> the time that i don &apos;t get to <unk> things , with people who mean something like this .
and i thought about the relationship with my wife , to friends , to people .
and after that , when i thought about it , i decided to put negative energy from my life .
it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s much better .
i didn &apos;t have two years with my wife <unk> .
it feels great .
i &apos;m not trying to get right ; i &apos;m trying to be happy to be happy .
the third thing that i learned -- and that &apos;s when the inner clock was <unk> , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 , ... &quot;
you see the water .
i said , &quot; please <unk> in the air . &quot;
i don &apos;t want this thing to be in 20 parts , as you know about <unk> .
while we <unk> , i had this feeling , human , to die , is not amazing .
it &apos;s like that , as we would talk about our lives long .
but it was very sad .
i didn &apos;t want to go ; i love my life .
and these crops are really <unk> in a thought , which is that i just wanted to be happy .
i just wish i could grow my children .
about a month after a month , i went to my daughter -- <unk> , not a lot of <unk> talent ...
thank you .
and i <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> like a little kid .
and in the world , all of a sense for me .
and i realized , i realized that the dots of each other , that it &apos;s just about being a great father to be a great father .
more than anything else , everything else is my only goal in life , a good father .
i became the miracle of the wonders of that day to die .
i got another gift , which is to see in the future , and to come back and live in the future .
my call on all of this , that &apos;s going to fly today , is : imagine the same thing happens on your flight -- please don &apos;t -- but imagine it , and how would you change it ?
what would you do that , because you think they &apos;re thinking about it ?
how would they change their relationships and the negative energy in it ?
and more than anything else , they &apos;re the best parents that you can only be ?
thank you .
the idea behind the <unk> <unk> is pretty simple .
we don &apos;t want the iran to make iran .
the most important end here for the development of nuclear gases is the <unk> in <unk> .
the <unk> that you see here , these are <unk> .
now , if we &apos;re able to control the systems , which is <unk> and <unk> , then we can actually use a lot of problems with <unk> .
they &apos;re not going to go through <unk> <unk> ; they &apos;re going to be on a completely different technology .
but if we create it , there is a <unk> <unk> on a laptop that will be used by a <unk> <unk> to <unk> this gray box , then we &apos;re in the business .
and this is the dialogue behind <unk> .
so we start with a <unk> .
the <unk> is going to be <unk> in the <unk> box , <unk> <unk> , and the arts <unk> <unk> -- to <unk> .
this is a <unk> , right ?
i want to tell you how we found that .
when we started to <unk> our research , six months ago , it was completely unknown , which was the sense of the sense and the purpose of this <unk> .
the only thing we knew is very much , very complicated , which is the <unk> part of the <unk> , the <unk> part , he made by a <unk> <unk> .
and it seemed to make something <unk> , with these <unk> <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> of our attention , and we started a <unk> project that we started to do with <unk> leaders , and we started this <unk> .
and then something wonderful happened .
<unk> <unk> , like a <unk> , who didn &apos;t love our name -- <unk> it , but didn &apos;t want to eat it .
it doesn &apos;t have any sense in my eyes .
and after we started working with different kinds of cheese , i went to say that this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s taken up to a particular goal .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the <unk> box , when a special configuration was discovered , even if this particular program was discovered . even if this particular program is trying to get it on this goal .
and if you don &apos;t , there &apos;s nothing .
so , this was really my interest , and we started working with this , almost about the clock , because i thought , we don &apos;t know what the goal is .
we could say , for example , an <unk> american power , or a <unk> in germany , or a <unk> in germany .
so we should be able to figure out what the goal is .
so <unk> , and <unk> , we have the <unk> code and found that he was in two digital <unk> -- a smaller and a bigger .
and in fact , in fact that they were very <unk> , of people who were obviously <unk> by people who had the most <unk> information .
they knew all of the bits and <unk> that they had to go .
never ever knew the <unk> of the <unk> .
so they knew everything .
and if you &apos;ve already noticed that the <unk> of <unk> is complex and <unk> , let me tell you : the <unk> are a science for us .
it &apos;s much easier than anything we &apos;ve ever seen .
here you see a clip from this <unk> code .
we talk about -- about 15,000 lines code .
it &apos;s pretty much like <unk> <unk> .
and i want to tell you how we were able to be smart .
so , for what we &apos;re going to do as the first thing , was <unk> <unk> , because we know what this is going to do .
and then we went to <unk> and <unk> and trying to get this with the real world in connection -- with potential alternatives in the real world .
so we needed theories about these goals that we could <unk> or <unk> .
and so , this theories , we call ourselves that it &apos;s going to be about <unk> <unk> , it has to make a <unk> goal , and it &apos;s very likely to do it in iran because there was most colors that have been seen in iran .
well , in this area , there are not several thousand goals .
and basically , it turns out on the <unk> <unk> , and on the <unk> , in <unk> .
so i said to my <unk> , &quot; let me get a list of all the problems for <unk> and solar systems from our <unk> . &quot;
and i called them , and you know , you know , you know , to compare their <unk> , what we &apos;ve found in the code and in the data , in the data .
and that worked very well .
so , it was possible to bring the small digital <unk> with the <unk> .
the <unk> is this moving part within the <unk> , this black object that you see .
and if you <unk> the speed of this <unk> , you &apos;re actually able to be able to <unk> the <unk> , and finally , to use the <unk> .
what we &apos;ve also found is that the goal of the attack was actually , slowly , slowly , it &apos;s slow and <unk> -- obviously in the attempt to get <unk> <unk> , so they &apos;re not going to be able to be able to be able to come back to it .
the big digital <unk> -- we &apos;ve got a hint of that , and we &apos;ve looked at a sense by the way we looked at it .
so , for example , the number of <unk> are very , from this code , you can &apos;t miss it .
and i started thinking about the scientific literature of <unk> , and that &apos;s how this <unk> was built in <unk> , and they found that they &apos;re <unk> in the so-called <unk> , and every <unk> is <unk> <unk> .
so this was what made sense of it .
and it was better .
this <unk> in iran are <unk> in 15 ways .
and think about what we found in the <unk> ?
it &apos;s almost identical structure .
so again , it &apos;s really good together .
and this gave us big confidence for what we &apos;re doing here .
well , you don &apos;t understand me wrong , that was not easy .
these results have been done by a couple of weeks by a couple of weeks ago .
and often , we were just sitting in a dead , and we had to collect ourselves together .
first of all , we found that both digital <unk> in reality , and the same goal is <unk> , but from various different directions .
so the little <unk> is a <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> , and the big <unk> , with six <unk> in interaction with six <unk> in interaction and <unk> tuna .
so , in the same time , we &apos;re very excited that we &apos;re actually convinced that we &apos;re actually <unk> what the goal is .
it &apos;s <unk> , and it &apos;s just <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have to worry that other goals could be met by <unk> .
here &apos;s something really cool stuff that we discovered -- that &apos;s really really what we discovered .
down the bottom line , the gray box , and on the top , you see the <unk> .
well , what this thing is is that it &apos;s the <unk> values of sensors -- so , for example , <unk> and <unk> -- and it shows <unk> code , which is still during the <unk> , with the wrong process .
and in fact , this is the wrong <unk> of <unk> before .
so it &apos;s just like in <unk> , where the <unk> of the <unk> , where the <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> .
that &apos;s cool , isn &apos;t it ?
the idea of this is obviously not just the way that the <unk> of the <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s a lot of dangerous and bad .
the idea is to <unk> a digital <unk> .
we need digital <unk> there , where a human <unk> can &apos;t react .
so in a power , for example , if the big <unk> is too quickly , you have to open <unk> within milliseconds .
of course , this is not going to be done by a human <unk> .
so , at this point , we need digital <unk> .
and if you &apos;re <unk> , you can really be able to do bad things .
the power can explode .
and not the <unk> , even the <unk> is going to notice it .
this is scary .
but it becomes even worse .
and what i &apos;m going to say is really important .
think about it . this <unk> is <unk> .
he has nothing to do with <unk> , with <unk> , with <unk> .
so , for example , he would work so well -- in a power , or in a <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
and you don &apos;t have to -- as the <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to get the <unk> of a <unk> camera , like we saw it in <unk> .
you could also use ordinary <unk> technology to spread .
you have to spread it just as much as possible .
and if you do that , you &apos;re going to get a <unk> <unk> .
this is the consequence that we need to ask ourselves .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of citizenship is not in the middle east .
they &apos;re in the united states , in europe and japan .
so all of these green areas , these are the <unk> environments .
we need to ask us the consequences , and we &apos;re going to do better .
thank you .
i have a question .
nathan , it became very much about that people believe that the <unk> of the <unk> is the <unk> .
isn &apos;t that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to know that ?
yeah . okay .
my opinion is the <unk> process , but the internet is not israel .
so the <unk> force is the <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s only one , and that &apos;s the united states -- for happiness , to happiness .
because it would be even bigger for our problem even bigger .
thank you that you &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> , thank you . thank you .
i spent the last couple of years that i spent the last couple of years to come into situations that usually are very difficult and the same time .
i went to jail -- hard .
i &apos;ve been working in a <unk> -- dangerous .
i was photographed in <unk> -- hard and dangerous .
and i &apos;ve spent 30 days ago , nothing as this one to eat here -- fun at the beginning , a little bit hard in the middle , very dangerous at the end .
in fact , i found the greatest part of my career , and that &apos;s all the time for trying to explore social beings , and that &apos;s all the time for trying to explore social beings so that it &apos;s a mathematical and interesting , and hopefully to create what it is for the audience to make fun and free power .
so when i knew that i &apos;d come here to come back to a tedtalk the world of <unk> and <unk> , i knew that i would make something a little different thing to do .
some of you may have heard about this , i &apos;ve had a group of weeks ago in ebay .
i read a couple of <unk> , some <unk> , and i gave people the opportunity to <unk> the <unk> of my tedtalk .
really , some of the happy people and companies , <unk> and <unk> , was the strong opportunity -- because i &apos;m sure chris , it &apos;s never going to have a title -- because i &apos;m sure that chris was not going to have an title , there was a lot of content , and not a lot of evidence on what the subject would actually be .
so what you &apos;ve got was this : your name here : my tedtalk , who you don &apos;t have a clue what &apos;s going to be the theme , and you &apos;ve ever got to get out of the ears to fly the ears , especially if i put their company to their <unk> <unk> .
but it &apos;s time , it &apos;s a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people look at these tedtalks ?
a whole lot .
that &apos;s just the <unk> .
so , because of that , i knew someone who would buy the <unk> .
if you had asked me a year ago , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to tell you that to tell you this with sure .
but in the new project i &apos;m working on , my new film , we study the world of marketing , the <unk> .
as i said , i &apos;ve been able to go into some pretty awful moments , but nothing could do me , nothing couldn &apos;t be able to do something so hard and so dangerous as dangerous as these guys are in a room .
you know , i had the idea for a film .
what i want to do is make a film about <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising , where all of the film is <unk> by <unk> <unk> , marketing and advertising .
and the film is going to be called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what happens in &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; is that everything , from the bottom to the bottom , from the beginning to the end of the end , is , from the end to the end , is the <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the film , that &apos;s the circle of <unk> that you &apos;re going to see in the film .
so , this brand , the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> center .
these people will be connected to the film in rwanda -- for all .
and so the film is going to explore this whole idea -- this is what ? in rwanda , for all ?
i &apos;m a <unk> person .
that was more to the <unk> .
it was &quot; in rwanda , for all . &quot;
but we &apos;re not only going to have the brand x as <unk> , but we &apos;re going to find sure that we &apos;re going to sell every possible category in the movie .
so we might sell a cart , and he &apos;s going to be the greatest cart that they ever had .
the biggest car that you &apos;ve ever seen , from &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the most important car you &apos;ve ever had , a attention of &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so , the idea is to show out that brands are a part of the life , actually to bring them to the film ?
and we actually show the whole process of how it works .
the goal of the entire film is transparency .
they &apos;re going to see the whole thing in the film of <unk> .
so this is the whole concept , the whole film , from the beginning to end .
and i &apos;d like to look at , if <unk> would help us do this .
you know , it &apos;s funny , because when i heard it first , it &apos;s the ultimate respect for the audience .
i don &apos;t know how <unk> people will be .
do you have a perspective -- i don &apos;t want to use the perspective , because that &apos;s a negative <unk> -- but you know how it &apos;s going to evolve ?
how much money will we need to realize that ?
it &apos;s millions of millions .
i think it &apos;s hard to meet them , but i think it &apos;s too much worth the way that i think it &apos;s worth a lot of suffering .
who knows when the film comes out , you might see how to be a <unk> <unk> .
what do you believe how the answer is going to be ?
the answer is very likely to be , &quot; no . &quot;
but is it a hard thing because of the film or a hard thing to me ?
<unk> : both .
well , that &apos;s not so optimistic .
so , my husband , you can help me ? i need help .
i can help .
okay .
great .
we need to think about what .
yeah .
if you look at people who you have to do it ?
there are some places that we can make ourselves .
imagine the camera .
i thought , &quot; do you ask the camera out of &quot; would mean that we wanted to be a <unk> .
it turns out that it was in reality , &quot; we want to have nothing to do with your film . &quot;
and just so , all these companies , one of these companies , one after the other .
no one wanted to do something with the film .
i was amazed .
they didn &apos;t want to do absolutely nothing with the project .
and i was confused , because i thought , the whole concept , the idea of advertising , your product as many people like possible to show the product as many people like possible .
in fact , in the world today , in the world of new and old media and <unk> media -- it &apos;s not the idea to be able to be in this new process , that the mass is going to make this message .
no , that was what i thought .
but you see , the problem was that my idea was a <unk> mistake , and that &apos;s what it was .
no , no , that was not the mistake .
that wouldn &apos;t have been a problem .
that would be okay .
but that &apos;s what this image is , is a problem .
you see , if you look at transparency in the <unk> , this is one of the first images that seems like this . this is one of the first images .
i really like your way , sergey brin . now .
this was the problem : transparency -- free of deception and <unk> , just to discover and <unk> , <unk> and access to information , particularly , which is <unk> -- the last line is certainly the biggest problem .
you know , we &apos;re going to hear a whole lot about transparency .
our politicians say it , our president says , even our employees say it .
but if it comes out , it &apos;s going to be done that it &apos;s going to change anything .
but why ? well , transparency is fear -- like this strange line , which is still <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> -- like this strange <unk> .
and it &apos;s also very risky .
what &apos;s possible ?
a whole <unk> <unk> food .
that &apos;s very risky .
so when i started talking to the companies and tell them that we wanted to tell this story , they said , &quot; no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story . &quot;
you see , when i was a kid , and my father was talking to me -- and there he sits and looked at me -- he would say , &quot; my son , there &apos;s three versions .
there &apos;s your version , there &apos;s my version , and there &apos;s the real version . &quot;
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real version .
but there &apos;s only a company that was willing to help us -- and that &apos;s just because i knew john feet and richard <unk> since years -- i realized that i had to do it alone , i had to do it to do the <unk> , and i had to go to the companies in my team .
so what you &apos;re suddenly trying to understand -- or what i started to understand -- was that if you start to talk to these companies , the idea of how your brand will be understood , a massive problem .
i have friends who make big , massive <unk> , and i &apos;ve got friends who are little <unk> like me .
and my friends , the big , <unk> <unk> , say that the reason that your movies are so successful , the <unk> that they have .
and then my friends , my friends who are doing little <unk> , &quot; well , how do we do with these big , huge <unk> ? &quot;
and the film is called &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
so what are we going to see in the film ?
and whenever i do that , i &apos;m going to do this , and whenever i get the <unk> , you &apos;re going to see you &apos;re going to see <unk> .
and every time i have somebody <unk> , i can tell you , &quot; are you <unk> enough for this interview ?
so , you know , you can see a little nervous .
i want to help you to calm down .
so maybe you should be a little bit about the interview , a little bit of this <unk> . &quot;
and then we offer one of these great <unk> .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> design &quot; or a <unk> <unk> , &quot; you &apos;re going to have a choice .
we &apos;re going to be <unk> for men as well as women -- <unk> , <unk> , or a stick , or a stick , whatever .
this is the <unk> .
now , i can see all of your questions , and you can give you a <unk> photograph .
we &apos;re a smaller brand .
so how you &apos;ve talked about the smaller movies , we &apos;re a brand <unk> .
so we don &apos;t have a budget like others .
so these things are to do -- you know , think about people -- that &apos;s kind of why we &apos;re interested .
what do you expect to describe it ?
it &apos;s <unk> .
that &apos;s a great question .
ted : <unk> technology .
technology is not the way to describe what you should describe to something that someone else is doing .
we &apos;re talking about <unk> , <unk> .
i think , &quot; <unk> &quot; is a great word that the category is really to make a difference in contrast , unlike &quot; <unk> smell and humidity . &quot;
it <unk> them .
how can we get them out longer -- better <unk> , more <unk> , three <unk> .
these things have a <unk> effect .
and this is a <unk> .
what about me ? what about the <unk> ?
i have to talk to the man on the street , which is like me , <unk> .
they want to tell me something about my brand .
how would you describe your brand ?
why , my brand ?
i don &apos;t know .
i really like to say beautiful clothing .
now , &apos; 80s <unk> <unk> on <unk> , except at the <unk> .
well , what is the brand <unk> ?
real .
i think the <unk> , the style that i have , is probably the <unk> glamour .
i like a lot of black colors , lots of <unk> and such a stuff .
but normally , i &apos;ve got a <unk> , like <unk> , or a <unk> , and this stuff .
woman : if dan would be a brand , he would probably be a classic <unk> .
number two : the brand that i am , i would say , <unk> fly .
number two : part of the <unk> , part of the <unk> , part of the <unk> -- i don &apos;t know .
one three : i &apos;m the <unk> .
i sell <unk> in the entire country , in the world .
so i think that &apos;s my brand .
this is my brand in my little , <unk> industry .
boy : my brand is <unk> , because i was <unk> .
boy 5 : little <unk> <unk> <unk> .
do that ?
<unk> : i &apos;m a <unk> .
i am tom .
well , we can &apos;t all be <unk> , but i often see myself on the interface of <unk> glamour and <unk> fly .
and what &apos;s noticed was that i needed a experts .
i needed somebody who could create in my head , somebody who could really help me understand what you call the <unk> .
and so i found a company called <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
they have companies like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to discover these <unk> .
if you could do it for that , you couldn &apos;t help me .
they brought their images , yes ?
that &apos;s me . the first picture is a picture of my family .
tell me just a little bit like this with their thoughts and feelings about them .
these are the people who are able to form my brain .
tell me about this world .
<unk> : this world ? i think the entire world is the world where you live on -- how people live around a day , the friends , the family , the way you live life , the work and so .
all of these things , and begin from a place , and for me , and they start with my family in west virginia .
what &apos;s the next thing you want to talk about .
the next thing . this was the most famous day of my life .
in which context is to the thoughts and feelings about them ?
it &apos;s like i want to be .
i like things that are different .
i like things that are inevitable . i like curious things .
tell me about the &quot; why &quot; <unk> -- what brings them to us ?
what is the <unk> ? in what <unk> are you now ?
why is it important , <unk> ? what is the red ?
tell me a little bit about this part .
a little bit more about them , they &apos;re not .
what else do they get them through ?
you don &apos;t have to be afraid of it . in which kind of <unk> are you ?
<unk> ! no , thank you .
thank you for your patience .
yeah . well . okay .
yeah , i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to do .
so there was a lot of crazy things in the same time .
the first thing i saw was this idea that their <unk> are two muslims , but they have <unk> sides -- the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> .
it &apos;s very good .
and i think there &apos;s almost a <unk> .
and i think a few companies will only focus on a strength , rather than both of them .
many companies tend to avoid -- and that &apos;s the human nature -- things that you &apos;re not sure you &apos;re going to avoid fear , these elements , and that you &apos;re going to turn them into something like this , and that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
what other universes are doing so ?
the first one is a classic , apple .
and you can see it also here , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
well , there are <unk> . and <unk> sauce , these things that come and come and forth , but a <unk> , <unk> brand is a pretty strong thing .
a <unk> , <unk> brand , how is your brand ?
if somebody would ask you to describe their <unk> , your <unk> , how would you be ?
they &apos;re going to be a <unk> ? are you something that &apos;s going to get the blood in <unk> ?
or are it more <unk> ?
are you something that seems to be a little confused , <unk> , sustainable ?
<unk> are things that are <unk> , <unk> like the <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> like <unk> .
or are it more like a <unk> ?
are they <unk> and <unk> like <unk> ?
are they used , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> like oprah ?
are it <unk> , stable , <unk> , safe , sure , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , how the dalai lama or <unk> ?
and in the course of the film , we had more than 500 companies who were sitting down and <unk> , and he said , &quot; no , because they didn &apos;t want to be part of the project .
they didn &apos;t want to do with this film because they didn &apos;t have control , because they don &apos;t have control , not control over the dream .
but it &apos;s going to come from 17 <unk> , who were ready to make these control that they wanted to do with somebody who wanted to do with somebody who we don &apos;t usually want to say -- stories that we don &apos;t usually have to tell -- stories that we don &apos;t usually want to be familiar with .
it <unk> us to tell the story of the <unk> , as we tell the story in this film that you &apos;re going to be used today , that you &apos;re going to be used to be <unk> by the brain of the brain , both to do with advertising as well as films .
we were going to go to sao , where <unk> was banned .
in the entire city since five years ago , there is no <unk> , no poster , no <unk> , no <unk> , nothing .
and we went to school in school , where companies have shared their way to <unk> schools , in the same world .
so the incredible thing for me is that the projects that i got the most of the news was , or where i had the biggest success , these are where i was able to fix things directly .
and this is what these brands have done .
because they <unk> the <unk> , they <unk> the vehicles , and they said that there may not be a lot of interest in mind .
i &apos;m going to do with the artists right ?
i &apos;m going to work with him and make something completely different , something that people are doing to think that our context .
and how did that mean for them ? what &apos;s it successful ?
now , there was the film at <unk> film institute , and we can look at this time .
it was <unk> in january , and since -- and since -- and that &apos;s not even the whole thing -- there was 15 million <unk> from this film .
this is actually only one of two weeks ago by two weeks ago .
that &apos;s just online -- no press , no press .
the film was not <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t even go online . no <unk> .
he &apos;s still not coming out in other countries .
well , finally , the film has been a very big <unk> .
and this is not bad for a project that &apos;s almost every <unk> , which we talked about before , their customers , to make the fingers of the fingers .
something that i believe is that if you make your chance to make risks , risks that are able to put risks in these risks .
i think if you think about it , you &apos;re going to take them closer to failure .
i believe that if you put your employees to avoid risks , you &apos;re going to do the whole company to get a profit .
i feel that we need to encourage people to make risks to take risks .
we need to encourage people , not to have fear of ways that they might be <unk> .
after all , we should be able to make fear .
we should put the bear in the cage .
welcome the fear . don &apos;t tell the risk .
there &apos;s a lot of <unk> full , so we &apos;re going to welcome the risk of risk .
and finally , we should say transparency .
today , more than ever before , we &apos;re going to make a little <unk> very far .
and that said , with <unk> and transparency , my entire talk , &quot; &quot; you &apos;re going to welcome transparency , &quot; she was told by my good friends from <unk> <unk> to ebay .
huge data will be made for organizations on the entire world in large ways .
<unk> <unk> : &quot; <unk> , transparency . &quot;
thank you .
well , <unk> , in the name of transparency , what &apos;s happening now is that what &apos;s going on with the $ $ dollars ?
that &apos;s a great question .
i &apos;ve got a button in my pocket , <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , the <unk> -- a shirt in the altitude of $ dollars , to fund my <unk> in the next year .
my name is <unk> .
after 18 months ago , i made something else at google , and i <unk> to do something with museums and art . my <unk> , which is also , i &apos;ve got green light .
and it took 18 months .
a lot of <unk> <unk> and stories , which i can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the chart .
there &apos;s a lot of stories about why we &apos;ve done this .
i think my personal view is very simple with this slide , and it tells you access .
i grew up in india .
i became a great education , and i didn &apos;t know -- but i didn &apos;t know -- but i had a lot of museums and that art is not access .
so when i started to visit these museums , i started to learn a lot of learning .
and while i was working for google , i tried to make this desire -- art <unk> -- with technology together .
we took a team , a great team , and we started with this .
i &apos;m going to start with the demonstration , and i &apos;m going to tell you some interesting things that happened since the beginning of the beginning .
so you &apos;re just going to go to <unk> .
you can look at all these museums here .
this is the <unk> , the moma , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
i even come to one of my favorite , the <unk> museum of a kind of new york .
you &apos;re sitting on two of them -- very simple .
<unk> , and <unk> , you &apos;re in this museum .
it doesn &apos;t matter where they are -- <unk> , mexico , it doesn &apos;t make difference .
you &apos;re going to go around and <unk> .
they want to turn into the museum ?
open up the map , and i &apos;m looking at it with a click .
there they are , they want to go to the end of the sahara .
just further . much fun .
use it .
thank you , but the best thing is .
so , i &apos;m talking about one of my <unk> , <unk> from <unk> <unk> in the evening .
i see this <unk> .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
this is one of the images .
these are all the <unk> .
those of you who are really interested in art , you can click here -- but i put it up now .
this is one of the images that we <unk> with the so-called <unk> .
this image for example has about 10 billion <unk> , i think .
and a lot of people ask me , &quot; what do you get for 10 billion <unk> ? &quot;
i &apos;m going to show you now .
you can get very easily and <unk> .
you see something fun here .
i love this guy ; his expression is <unk> .
but then you really want to do deep inside .
and so i started playing on around around the time , and i realized that there &apos;s something like this .
and i thought , &quot; wait time , that sounds interesting . &quot;
i went close to close , and i realized that these children are actually doing something like this .
i thought a little bit , i was talking to a couple of known to college , and i actually found that it &apos;s about a game called <unk> , where a <unk> is going to be <unk> with a site .
it was really popular .
i don &apos;t know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
to really go close , you can go to the <unk> .
just to give you the <unk> , i think you can see what you get .
here we were , and this is the paintings .
but the best thing is -- in one second .
let &apos;s go back to moma , back to moma , back in new york .
another <unk> of mine , <unk> .
at the first example , it was about to find details .
but what if you want to see the <unk> ?
and what only if you &apos;re going to see van <unk> , is to create this <unk> ?
you can go into it . you can really go into it .
i &apos;m going to put in one of my <unk> in this picture , and i &apos;m really able to put it into this picture .
this is <unk> , probably never seen before .
now i &apos;m going to show you my favorite function .
there &apos;s a lot of other , but i &apos;m missing time .
that &apos;s really cool part , he &apos;s called <unk> .
every one of them , every one of them -- just if you have rich house or poor , whether you don &apos;t have a great house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
you can build and put your own in the same museum -- from all these images , you can make their own collection .
it &apos;s simple , they go into -- and i &apos;ve created this , it means the power of the <unk> -- you can see <unk> .
this is called the <unk> , in the <unk> .
they can send all of their friends to send their friends , and so a conversation begins about what they feel when they look at these muslims .
i think , at the end , the main thing is that all the wonderful things here is not from google .
they &apos;re going to come to me , not even from the museums .
i don &apos;t want to tell you .
they come from the artists .
and that was a experience in humility for me .
i mean , i hope that we &apos;re going to do with this digital medium of art , and they &apos;re <unk> online .
and this is the biggest question that i &apos;m going to ask me was like , &quot; have it done to make the experience of a <unk> ? &quot;
the answer is no .
it &apos;s going to take a lot of experience .
that &apos;s what it is . thank you .
thank you .
this is an image of your brain . your brain can be <unk> in two <unk> .
this is the left half , which is the logical side side , and then the right half , the dangerous side is .
if we had a scale to measure the <unk> of every kingdom , we might be able to measure their brain .
for example , this guy would be completely strange .
this would be someone who &apos;s completely intuitive .
now , where would you get your brain on this scale ?
some of us may have decided for one of these extreme decided , but i think that most people in the audience , your brain is about this -- with a high <unk> , which is at the same time in the same time .
it &apos;s not as if they &apos;re both <unk> or this .
they can be horrible and intuitive .
and so , i see myself as one of the people , together with the most different original <unk> , which is a good part of logic to create the complex ideas together .
but at the same time , we need a good amount of intuition about experiments in the same time .
how do we develop this intuition ? well , we love to play it with things .
so we go out and play , and look at it , and then we &apos;re going to start to develop in our intuition .
and basically , they &apos;re doing the same .
so one of the bees that they &apos;ve developed over the years is probably probably that one thing can be the same time to be in the same time .
i mean , it can be strange to think about that one thing on the same time in two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they &apos;ve evolved .
i remember a kid to see a kid on a <unk> .
he was still a <unk> , and not very good at it , and it was all the time .
but i bet it &apos;s going to play a very valuable lesson that taught us , which is the big things that we &apos;re not just talking about , and that they &apos;re going to stay in a place .
and this is a great <unk> model of the world , so long they &apos;re not <unk> .
it would be an extraordinary model for a <unk> , because they don &apos;t play with <unk> , but with these little strange particles .
and if you play with their particles , you can see all sorts of strange things -- how they fly directly through walls , or that they can be able to be able to be able to be able to be in two different places .
and so , she wrote all this observations , and he called them the theory of quantum mechanics .
that was the point of physics recently , and you needed the mechanics to describe the small , tiny particles .
but you didn &apos;t need to describe the big everyday objects around us .
now , this is not easy , and that &apos;s not just because i don &apos;t want to play with particles .
well , i want to play with them , but not very often .
and i never saw her .
i mean , no one has ever seen a particle .
but i don &apos;t have the <unk> side of it .
because if all of the things out of particles are , and all these particles are the rules of quantum mechanics , should not just follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ?
i don &apos;t see the reason that it should not be like that .
so , i &apos;d like to make <unk> better with the whole thing if we could show something that <unk> is also the rules of quantum mechanics .
so i made a couple of years ago to do that .
i created one .
this is the first object you can see that in the <unk> <unk> .
so what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can see this green dot there in the middle of the middle .
this is the piece of metal that i &apos;m going to talk about .
this is a picture of the object .
this is what i &apos;m doing here . we &apos;re looking at this in the center of the center .
and here &apos;s a really very big mirror of this little piece of metal in this small piece of metal .
so what we &apos;re looking at is a small piece of metal , like a <unk> , and it &apos;s about the edge of the edge .
so i made this thing on similar ways to make a computer chip .
i went into a clean room with new <unk> , and <unk> <unk> for 100 hours of all the big devices .
so for the last bit , i had to build my own machine -- to make this as a <unk> company and to get the thing .
this thing has made the ability to be able to be able to be <unk> , but it takes a little help to do it .
look , let me give you a analogy .
you know how easy it is to be in a full .
i mean , if i &apos;m going to be in the <unk> , i &apos;m going to do all sorts of strange things , but then i hear other people , and i listen to all these things , because i don &apos;t want to do it with it , or it &apos;s open , <unk> , <unk> .
so why tells us that <unk> objects will feel like the same .
the <unk> of <unk> objects are not only people , but also the light that seems to you , and the wind , which shows you , and the wind of space .
and so we knew that if we wanted to see this piece of metal <unk> , we &apos;ve got to use this piece of metal <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we did .
we put the light down , put it into a vacuum , and <unk> the entire air , and <unk> it down to almost , all the time in the <unk> , was the piece of metal , to behave as soon as they wanted to do it .
so we &apos;ve done his movement .
we found that it &apos;s really strange .
instead , it &apos;s easy to be there , <unk> it . the way it &apos;s <unk> was about this -- like this -- like this -- like this , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
in which we gave him a little <unk> , we could be able to turn it into the same time , and it doesn &apos;t <unk> -- something that allows us in quantum mechanics .
so what i &apos;m going to tell you is what &apos;s really fantastic .
what does it mean for a object for the same time , and it doesn &apos;t get it ?
let &apos;s think about atoms .
so the first case : all the <unk> of atoms that are the piece of metal , there &apos;s a piece of metal there , and at the same time , the same atoms , the same atoms and the same atoms .
it &apos;s too much more <unk> voices .
the rest of the time is <unk> .
that means that every atom on the same time is in two different places , which is the whole piece of metal in two different places , which is the entire piece of metal in two different places .
i think that &apos;s really cool .
really .
that was it worth me for all this year in the <unk> room , because , you see this , the <unk> between a single atom , and this piece of metal is about the same as the difference between the piece of metal and them .
so if a single atom can be in two different places in two different places , this piece of metal can be in two different places , why not you ?
i mean , this is just what i &apos;m going to say .
so , imagine , they would be at the same time in multiple places , how would it feel like that ?
how would you deal with the consciousness that your body is in the room ?
there &apos;s another aspect of the story .
when we <unk> it , the light <unk> and the box <unk> , we saw that the piece of metal was always in a piece of there .
and so , i had to develop this new intuition that looks like all the things in the interface in fact is only <unk> objects that are in a small room together .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is connected to everything .
well , that &apos;s not true .
there &apos;s more than that , it &apos;s still deeper .
it &apos;s so that these connections , their connections with all the things around them , literally define who they are . and that &apos;s the <unk> and strange of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
and in 2007 , i decided that we should be <unk> , as we think about economic development .
it should be our goal that , if families think about where they live and work and work , you want to have the opportunity to stop between least a hand full of different cities that are all in competition for new residents .
in the moment , we &apos;re far out of this goal .
there are billions of people in developing developing countries that don &apos;t even have a single city that they would welcome .
but the amazing thing about cities is that they &apos;re so much more worth than it costs them .
so we could make the world very simple with <unk> , maybe even hundreds of new cities .
now this sounds may be <unk> for you , if you never thought about new cities .
let &apos;s just take the <unk> of apartments against the world of cities .
imagine that half of the people who want to live in schools , they were already doing that , the other half , but not .
you could try to produce the capacity of all the world in the world .
but you know what they would be like to do in these apartments and their surroundings are the laws to avoid <unk> and <unk> .
so it turns out as very hard , all of these <unk> <unk> .
but you could go into a completely new place to build a completely new <unk> , if the laws would be able to support a <unk> , and they don &apos;t use it .
so i realized that governments are able to create new surfaces that &apos;s enough space for a city , and you &apos;ve got a name : <unk> cities .
so , i found that , over the same time , i found that , about the same time , <unk> and <unk> <unk> about the challenge of a <unk> .
they knew that every year every year ago , <unk> <unk> , in the united states , and they wanted to know what they could do to make sure that these people can stay in their country , and they &apos;re going to be able to do the same thing that people can stay in their country and the same thing .
now , in this point , <unk> <unk> said , &quot; what happens when we &apos;re going to do a <unk> size of our country , which is , if we just go to a <unk> surface of our country , and if people go to the united states , you can do a part of the american message , and if the united states , you can do everything that you &apos;re going to do for canada or america ? &quot;
in the summer , in 2009 , in the summer of 2009 .
and at the next <unk> elections , <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk> , which is the <unk> of both innovations , as well as <unk> .
he thought <unk> <unk> to be <unk> .
and in the meantime , i was talking about a talk about tedglobal .
and in biology , trying to try and <unk> , i tried to use this complicated concept of the <unk> city to produce elements .
the first point is the importance of laws , the laws that determine that you &apos;ve already been able to be <unk> .
we &apos;re going to pay for new technologies , but for the progress , we need technology and laws , and it &apos;s the most important laws that <unk> us .
in the fall of 2010 , a friend of <unk> <unk> the link to the tedtalk .
and that &apos;s what i showed him .
the two <unk> me .
and they said , &quot; let &apos;s take the <unk> of our country ! &quot;
so we met in december in the coast of a age in miami in miami .
i &apos;ve tried to make sure how valuable cities are , how much worse they are than they cost .
and i used this graph to show how valuable <unk> is in a place like new york , thinking about a place in some cases in some cases per square million dollars .
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , in a place when there was a <unk> , <unk> said , &quot; paul , maybe we might look at the tedtalk . &quot;
so , the tedtalk was in very simple form that an <unk> city is a place , which is the beginning of <unk> land , which is an <unk> , which is the laws of the laws that exist there , and the people who make the opportunity to live either under these rules or not .
so , i was asked by the president of <unk> , who said that we need to make this project that it &apos;s important , and that &apos;s the way that this is the way we &apos;re doing our country .
i was asked to come back to <unk> , and i was going to be in the fourth and fifth january of january .
so , i think another with the facts of <unk> talk , which is a graph like this , that &apos;s trying to explain that if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it &apos;s a very big city to be a very big city .
this is a picture of the city <unk> , and the pen shows the new airport that was built in <unk> .
since this airport has been a area of 100 <unk> .
so i tried to convince the <unk> of this , if you want to build a new city , you have to start with a area of least 1,000 <unk> .
this is more than 250 thousand morning .
they &apos;re all <unk> , all the <unk> .
the faces of the audience were very seriously and attention .
the <unk> of school came to the stage , and he said , &quot; professor <unk> , i thank you for your talk , but maybe we might look at the tedtalk .
i &apos;ve got him on my laptop . &quot;
so i sat down , and they &apos;re going to go to the tedtalk .
and i &apos;m going to come to the <unk> that a new city of the people &apos;s new possibilities .
there would be the opportunity to live in a city that would be in uruguay , rather than hundreds of kilometers away in the north .
and a new city is also <unk> new possibilities for leaders .
the leaders of the government would be <unk> on the help of <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> , they could benefit from their <unk> to this charter , and we would support that everybody to trust that the charter is really <unk> .
and the realization of president <unk> was that the <unk> of the <unk> that i thought , as a way to put the electronic investors to come to come and get these city , for all of the parties that could be <unk> for all of the parties that have been <unk> for many years .
we &apos;re in a area .
this picture is from this place .
it <unk> a thousand square square kilometers .
and shortly after that , at january , in january , they &apos;ve got to be in congress for a change of the constitution , to have a <unk> change that &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , which is special <unk> .
in a country , this is just a successful crisis behind the congress for these <unk> <unk> to a voice for this <unk> .
all of the parties , all the <unk> of society , <unk> this .
to be part of the constitution , it has to be treated twice by congress .
at february february , it became a second time with <unk> to a voice .
according to this choice , between the 21st and korea , a category of about 30 <unk> <unk> on the two places of the world who were most interested in the world , in fact , in the business of the <unk> .
one place is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new seas , which was built in south south africa built in south south africa than the world <unk> .
all you can see on this picture was built within four years after it took four years after it , and they needed four years to get the <unk> .
the other place that was very interested in the <unk> , singapore .
there are already two cities in china , and the third is in sweden .
so if you think about this , it &apos;s about where we are here today .
they already have a <unk> , and they &apos;re talking about this area for the second city .
it &apos;s going to be working on a solar system that <unk> allows us to do , and it &apos;s also going to work in a <unk> system .
so a country has already had given the top of the <unk> , as a dish for the <unk> of the <unk> system of the <unk> system .
and the <unk> and <unk> are very interested .
they even bring the <unk> with one .
one thing that you already know was already , there &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
there are lots of identities that would like to be in america , especially in a place with a <unk> , and there are many people who want to live there .
in the entire world , there are 700 million people who tell you that they would like to live in a different place .
a million people spend a year of latin america and <unk> in the united states .
many of them are fathers who were forced to be forced to their families to <unk> their families , sometimes they &apos;re dead who need to make enough money to make food and clothing .
unfortunately , sometimes there are children who try to find their parents back back to their parents that they don &apos;t have , in some cases , for a decade , since a decade ago .
so what is it for a idea of thinking about thinking about a completely new city ?
or even <unk> from these cities , or hundreds of different in the world ?
so what is it for a idea that every family has a choice between multiple cities that have a choice between new residents ?
this is a idea that &apos;s going to protect .
my friends from <unk> asked me to say , thank you ted .
you know how many decisions you do on a typical day ?
you know how many decisions you meet in a typical week ?
i &apos;ve done a conference with about 2,000 americans , and the average number of decisions , the average number of decisions that <unk> a typical americans on a day is <unk> .
and in fact , recently , a study with scotland , where they &apos;ve done a week for a week for a week .
and these scientists have just got the different issues with which this husband , and how much time they have to meet choices to meet decisions that are useful to the issues .
and they &apos;ve found that a average ceo was working on the week with <unk> tasks .
every one of these issues was from many , many smaller decisions .
50 percent of their decisions were living in nine minutes or less .
for about 12 percent of their decisions , they needed a hour or more their time .
think about their own decisions .
do you know how many decisions you &apos;re in the nine minutes of the <unk> of the age of a hour ?
how good , do you think , are they going to make decisions ?
today , i want to talk about one of the most of the most of our modern time of our modern time , the <unk> .
i want to talk about the problem and talk about some kinds of possible solutions .
now , if i talk about this problem , i &apos;m going to ask you some questions , and i want to know your answers .
if i ask you a question , raise them , i &apos;m blind , just the hand , if you want to burn a few calories .
anybody , i ask them when i ask you a question , and your answer is , so my first question for today is : are you ready to hear something about the <unk> ?
thank you .
when i was a <unk> at stanford university , i went to this very , very <unk> , and at least , he was really <unk> .
it was a store called <unk> .
this business , it was almost like a <unk> .
they had 250 different kinds of errors and <unk> , and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of water -- and that was a time when we &apos;ve been able to be <unk> .
i loved it to this business , but at one point , i asked myself , well , how does it come to me , you know , how does it get you to do something ?
here &apos;s the olive .
they had over 75 different kinds of olive olive oil , including the ones that were in <unk> , who came from a thousand years old <unk> .
so i decided to visit a day to visit the <unk> , and i asked the <unk> , &quot; well , this model that they really offer people all of these possibilities ? &quot;
and he showed up to the <unk> of the way that every day came from , and they &apos;ve got their cameras out .
we decided to make a experiment , and we chose <unk> for our experiment .
here &apos;s her <unk> .
they had <unk> different kinds of <unk> .
we &apos;ve got a little <unk> right now on the <unk> of the <unk> .
we &apos;ve come there six different <unk> or 24 different <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i &apos;ve looked at two things : first , i mean , how many more people are going to stay .
it &apos;s more people who have been done when it was 24 , about 60 percent than when it was six , about 40 percent .
and after that , we looked at the case that people had to buy a glass <unk> .
now we looked at the opposite effect .
and the people who have died as it was 24 , only three percent was actually a glass <unk> .
from the people who have died as it was six , now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a glass <unk> .
now , if you calculate it , the people bought six times more than a glass <unk> , who they had six to choice as if they had 24 to choice .
now , you don &apos;t want to buy glass <unk> is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our <unk> -- but it turns out that the <unk> <unk> is changing us .
we don &apos;t decide to decide , even if it &apos;s against our own best interests .
so , the theme of the day : community save .
i &apos;m going to describe a study that i &apos;m going to describe with <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , in which we have the choices to <unk> for almost a million americans from about <unk> plans in the entire united states in the entire united states .
and what we looked at was whether the number of <unk> , which is one of the <unk> that was possible , the <unk> plan that is the likelihood of whether more for tomorrow .
and we found that , in fact , we had a relationship .
so , in these plans , we had about <unk> plans that have the people who had something between two to <unk> different fund .
and what we found was that the more fund was that the more fund was that , in fact , in the fact that it was <unk> .
if you look at the extremes , the plans that are two fund , the plans that have two fund , had a <unk> in the 1960s -- still not as high as we want it .
in the plans that are almost 60 fund , the <unk> , the <unk> are now on about the <unk> <unk> .
now turns out that even if you go to <unk> , if more opportunity to get to choice , even then it &apos;s negative consequences .
so , the people who decided to go out is more likely that the more possibilities that they were used to have , the more opportunity to choose to choose and choose to choose .
the more possibilities that they were used to have , the more that they were more likely to get their entire money in <unk> .
no one of these extreme decisions , heard of the decisions that someone would expect to be , if you think about your future community &apos;s well-being .
now , in the last 10 years , we &apos;ve seen three evolutionary negative consequences that are going to be seen by more and more choices to do with more and more choices .
they &apos;re looking at the decision -- they &apos;re looking at yourself , even if it &apos;s against their own best interest .
they &apos;re going to meet worse decisions -- rare climbers and rare medical decisions .
they don &apos;t choose more for things that they expect less happy , even if you make it better better .
so the key thing is that we might be able to give us this huge <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , but we &apos;re not going to look at the <unk> and <unk> , and then we can actually choose to see what &apos;s going to be made of the amazing choice .
so what i want to show you today is four simple techniques -- techniques that we have on different kinds of different and different <unk> -- that you can just use in their business .
the first thing is <unk> .
they &apos;ve heard about it before , but it never was true than today that is less more .
people are always talking when i say , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re always concerned that they lose <unk> .
but in truth , we &apos;re going to see it &apos;s more and more that if you &apos;re willing to get rid of , and you &apos;re going to be able to get the <unk> <unk> possibilities , well , there is a increase in the cost , &amp; amp ; and there &apos;s a variety of <unk> .
as a <unk> and <unk> , the different wright and <unk> species of 26 <unk> , she had a increase in a range of 1.5 than 10 percent .
as the golden <unk> , her 10 in the worst sold , <unk> <unk> , she was that the cost of <unk> percent of <unk> -- a result of both of the two , which is the increase of <unk> and the <unk> of the cost of the cost of the cost .
you know , the average <unk> today , gives you about humanity products .
a typical beach is going to give you 100,000 products .
but the <unk> lama , which is today <unk> in the world today , and they only give them 26 products -- a kind of <unk> .
now , in the world of <unk> , i think of one of the best examples that happened in the market , like you &apos;ve got to be able to <unk> the choice , was something that david <unk> was very strong , it &apos;s a program that &apos;s going to be used in harvard .
every single harvard career , we &apos;re going to go back to a <unk> part .
the ones that really want to meet a choice is going to have 20 fund , not 300 or more fund .
you know how people often say , &quot; i don &apos;t know how i want to make it .
it &apos;s all important possibilities . &quot;
and the first thing i &apos;m talking about is , &quot; tell me how the possibilities are different from each other .
and if their employees can &apos;t <unk> them , you can &apos;t do their clients . &quot;
now before we started talking today , i had a conversation with gary .
and gary said that he was willing to give all of the people in this audience to give a <unk> <unk> in the world of the world .
here &apos;s a description of the road .
and i want to read that .
and now i &apos;m going to give you a few seconds to read them , and after that , i ask them to clap if you &apos;re willing to teach it <unk> .
okay . all of the things that &apos;s ready to do it .
are all this ?
okay , let me show you something more about it .
they knew it was a trick , right ?
well , who &apos;s ready for this journey .
i think maybe i &apos;ve heard more hands .
okay .
in fact , that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking at is the first time that we had more information than the second time , but i would be able to think it &apos;s going to be able to think it &apos;s the second time in the second time .
because the images was able to make it real .
so what i &apos;m going to do to do with the second technology that helps you to deal with the problem of <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> .
it &apos;s about that people to understand the difference between ways to understand the difference between ways to understand the consequences with the individual possibilities , and that the consequence of these consequences have to be felt .
why do you give people about eight percent more than 30 percent more , if you use a <unk> or a <unk> .
because it &apos;s not what we feel .
and it turns out that if you make it a little bit easier , it &apos;s a very good tool , it &apos;s a very good tool to save the people to save more .
so we &apos;ve done in a study that i &apos;ve done with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , we &apos;ve done a study with the people in <unk> -- and these people were all working in a <unk> where they &apos;ve done their weapons for their <unk> .
and while this <unk> , we &apos;ve got these <unk> exactly as they were always going to be , except we &apos;ve got a little bit .
the small thing that we &apos;ve done is that we had asked people to think of all the positive things that would happen in their life if they were going to save money in their life , if they would save money .
in which we did this simple thing , there was a increase of <unk> to 20 percent , and there was a increase of the number of people who were willing to save or a range of four percent that they &apos;re ready to pay for the <unk> .
the third technology : <unk> .
we can make better categories as a better choice .
here , for example , a study that we &apos;ve done in a <unk> .
it turns out that it &apos;s in the <unk> <unk> , and the bottom of the <unk> , the number between <unk> different kinds of magazines to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
but you know what ?
if i &apos;m going to show you 600 papers , and you &apos;re sitting in 10 categories , or i &apos;m going to show you 400 papers , and that in 20 categories <unk> , you believe that i had more choice and a better <unk> , when i had a 400 <unk> .
because the categories tells me how i can be apart apart .
here are two different <unk> .
one means , &quot; oh , &quot; and the other is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if you think that the left is <unk> , and the protocell right is , they &apos;re <unk> in the hands .
okay , there &apos;s a couple .
if you think that this is on the left side side , and that &apos;s where the right side is <unk> , then you &apos;re <unk> .
okay , a few more .
well , it turns out they &apos;re right .
the one on the left is male and the <unk> on the right is <unk> , but you know what ?
this is a <unk> <unk> .
the categories have to tell you something like that , not the <unk> of the choice .
and this problem you often see when you look at the long side of all this fund .
where do you think about it ?
my fourth technology : <unk> of complexity .
it turns out that we can deal with more information than we think , we need to make it only <unk> .
we need to increase complexity slowly .
i &apos;m going to show you one example of what i mean .
let &apos;s give you a very , very complicated decision : the reputation of a car .
here &apos;s a german <unk> , which shows them the possibility to <unk> their car .
they have to meet enceladus different decisions to create their car .
now , these decisions are different in the number of choice that they have a decision .
<unk> , <unk> of the car -- i have 56 possibilities .
motors , ngos -- four possibilities .
what i &apos;m doing now is that i change the evidence that makes decisions .
half of the customers are going to be <unk> by the many possibilities , angry <unk> to the small possibilities , four <unk> .
the other half of the customers are coming from the small possibilities , four <unk> , to the <unk> <unk> , many ways .
what do i look at ?
how do you think about it .
if you use the <unk> in the decision , it means that they &apos;re going to be <unk> , the <unk> , i &apos;m going to do it .
what you &apos;re finding is that the people who are going to go out of the small <unk> , and they &apos;re always trying to choose the <unk> .
we lose them .
go from the little choice to the many , you &apos;re going to get it out .
it &apos;s the same information . it &apos;s the same number of possibilities .
the only thing i &apos;ve done is to change the evidence that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
when i start with the simple example , i &apos;m learning like i <unk> .
even even though the <unk> , i don &apos;t want to teach me about my preferences at the <unk> , i &apos;m always supposed to forget about it .
it also <unk> me about the big product that i <unk> , and so i &apos;m willing to make me work with interest with interest .
let me look at me .
i told you about four techniques that &apos;s the problem of the <unk> -- <unk> -- so you &apos;re going to get the <unk> alternatives ; <unk> -- do it real ; we can make better categories , less possibilities , in complexity .
every one of these techniques that i &apos;m talking about today is to help you help the possibilities -- good for you , you can use it for yourself , good for people to offer their service .
because i think the key to the best choice is that you &apos;re in the choice .
and the more we &apos;re going to choose to choose , the better we &apos;re going to be able to deal with the art of the decision .
thank you .
hello . i am kevin <unk> , <unk> at youtube . i look at <unk> .
that &apos;s true .
today we want to talk about how videos are going to be <unk> , and then , it &apos;s important .
we all want to be mobile -- <unk> , <unk> -- when i was young , it seemed so hard to do it .
but <unk> gives us that we &apos;re all about , or all of our creative activities , in a part of the culture , in a part of the culture of our world .
every single one of you could be famous about the internet to the next saturday .
but in youtube , more than 48 hours per minute per minute .
this is just a tiny percentage of a tiny percentage , and it &apos;s going to end up thousands of times , and so the cultural moment , and so the cultural moment .
so how does that work ?
three things : <unk> , <unk> and the unexpected .
well , then we want to do .
oh my god . oh my god .
oh my god !
<unk> !
<unk> , <unk> !
last year , <unk> <unk> <unk> was this video that he was published by his house in <unk> national park .
2000 , there was 23 million times .
this graph shows how it looked like this , when the video was the video last summer for the first time .
in fact , i didn &apos;t want to make a piece of video video .
he just wanted to share a protocell .
because that &apos;s how to do that , if you call <unk> <unk> .
he had <unk> a lot of <unk> .
and this video was actually played in january of january .
what &apos;s happening here ?
there was martin <unk> .
martin <unk> <unk> <unk> , who made the video last couple of time .
because <unk> like jimmy <unk> , we show us new and interesting things , and i show them a big audience .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and she didn &apos;t think that we would have these entertainment , without talking about this video without talking about this video , i hope .
<unk> <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; is one of the <unk> videos of the year .
this year was almost 200 million times .
this is what the graph looked like .
it seems like &quot; the <unk> <unk> , &quot; it doesn &apos;t seem to be done .
what happened to this day ?
well , it was friday , that &apos;s true .
if you want to know , these other <unk> are also <unk> .
but what about that day , this particular friday ?
well , <unk> <unk> it on , many blogs began to write about it .
michael <unk> mandela from the <unk> science institute was one of the first thing that they did with twitter .
in fact , a single person or a group of <unk> has a piece of <unk> , with a big audience , and that &apos;s <unk> the process .
and then , these community , of people who have <unk> these big <unk> , and i started talking about it , and i started talking about this .
now there &apos;s 10,000 <unk> of &quot; <unk> &quot; on youtube .
now , in the first seven days , there was a <unk> for every single day .
more than the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century is to be part of this phenomenon , we &apos;re going to be part of this phenomenon -- either by using it , or to make something new from it .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is animation and music in <unk> .
that &apos;s what it is .
this year was almost 50 million times .
and if you <unk> this for crazy , you would know that there &apos;s a <unk> , which has been looked at four million times .
even cats look at this video .
eyes look at cats that look at this video .
what &apos;s important is the creativity that are in the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
there was <unk> .
somebody would have a <unk> version of it .
and then it was international .
one of the <unk> came out of the floor of the floor that made it from a bad joke to something that we &apos;re all going to do .
today , we don &apos;t just think about something , we &apos;re doing with it .
who would have had this <unk> ?
who would have said , &quot; the <unk> &quot; or <unk> black , or <unk> black , &quot; are you able to predict ?
what <unk> could you write in which there &apos;s something like that ?
in a world where every minute of two days ago , you can only be <unk> , it &apos;s just really unique and unexpected <unk> like that .
i &apos;m not interested , i was not interested in , as i said a friend , i &apos;d like to look at this great video , about a guy who &apos;s in new york against <unk> .
i got a ticket , because i &apos;m not going to go on the <unk> , but often there are the revolution that we &apos;re going to go to the <unk> .
and this was completely surprising , and he was <unk> <unk> <unk> idea and his argument five million times .
this approach is true for all new things that we &apos;re doing creative .
and all this leads to be a big question .
what does that mean ?
<unk> .
what does that mean ?
<unk> , creative <unk> , completely unexpected , are the characteristics of a new kind of media and culture that everybody has access to the audience .
as i said , one of the most of the world &apos;s largest neurons -- doug <unk> -- made his beginning for youtube .
no one has to give your ideas green light .
and today , we &apos;re all going to know as a <unk> of our tradition .
and these are not the characteristics of the old media , and they &apos;re also not going to meet the media of today , but they &apos;re going to predict the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
now , how can i talk about the <unk> between women over three generations , and how the amazing strength of this is living in the life of a <unk> girl , when she was talking about 30 years ago , her mom and her grandmother , in a small boat , and she had never been <unk> -- this little girl who lives now in san francisco , and they &apos;re talking to you today ?
the story is not over .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s going to be <unk> .
i want to tell you about some of the <unk> .
imagine the first piece of : a man who &apos;s going to be <unk> .
he &apos;s a poet , a writer , a writer , one man , his entire life from the simple hope of unity and freedom of his home .
so , if you put it down to the <unk> of the <unk> in <unk> eyes , like he has to say that his life was a single waste .
the words , so long , his friends , <unk> now his friends .
he went back to the silence .
he died , broken by the story .
he &apos;s my grandfather .
i never met him .
but our lives are so much more than our memories .
my grandmother didn &apos;t never forget his life .
i had to worry that it was not for free , and it was my job to learn that the story was really trying to <unk> us , and we &apos;re talking about it .
so the next <unk> shows , like a boat in the early <unk> <unk> in the lake .
my mother may be 18 , when her father died -- already in a <unk> marriage ago , with two little girls .
for them , you had a challenge to get her to my family and a new life in australia , and a new life in australia .
it was completely <unk> that they could fail .
and after a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , a boat was able to be able to the lake , as a <unk> .
all the adults were aware of risks .
the biggest fear they had was <unk> , rape and death .
like most adults on the boat , my mother had a little <unk> .
when you had one <unk> , my sister , and i said , you know , and my grandmother would marry it .
my first memories are from this boat -- the <unk> <unk> of the motors that <unk> every wave on the <unk> , the <unk> and empty horizon .
i don &apos;t remember the <unk> , which was a lot of times , but that &apos;s about the <unk> of the men on our boat , or on the <unk> of the motors , who didn &apos;t want six hours .
but i remember the lights of the <unk> of the <unk> coast of the <unk> coast , and the young man who died and died , the end of the journey was too much for him , and the taste of the first <unk> , who had one of the men on the platform .
no apple has ever done again .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in <unk> .
and the next <unk> is from four women in three generations that create a new life .
we went out in <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the population of <unk> .
different than in the <unk> <unk> , whose existence was completely unknown , it was not <unk> .
the <unk> came out of the <unk> came from the rest of the world .
and the <unk> broken <unk> became between people who had one thing in common : they started to do new .
my mom was working on <unk> , and then one of the <unk> in a <unk> , six days , <unk> <unk> .
it was kind of able to find the time to find english and <unk> .
we were poor .
every dollar , and it was used in other education for english and mathematics , not what we had to do with it , but most of the things that were always had to do with it , and most of the things were always taken out of the second hand .
two couple of <unk> for the school , every time to <unk> holes in the other day .
one <unk> to the <unk> , because they had to get six years .
and there were the rare , but there were <unk> <unk> of &quot; <unk> , &quot; and there &apos;s <unk> , &quot; <unk> , goes home . &quot;
on home where ?
this is a <unk> in me .
there was a meeting to the <unk> , and a <unk> voice said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go out of the way . &quot;
my mom , my sister , and i sat in the same bed .
my mom was exhausted every night , but we told each other of our day , and they heard the movements of our grandmother , and they heard the movements of our grandmother .
my mom was <unk> from the boat of the boat .
and it was my challenge to stay every night until her <unk> came up to her <unk> .
it was a <unk> , and then he made a <unk> , and then we have a business , and he &apos;s got a business .
and the women came up with their stories about men who don &apos;t change the change , angry and <unk> , and <unk> children , in two worlds .
<unk> and <unk> were going to be <unk> .
depression were built .
i lived in <unk> .
in one point , i was the classic hall in the student , the <unk> <unk> of themselves .
in the other time , i was living in yemen life , the story of the <unk> of violence , the <unk> and the reality .
but so many of the years about the years .
and because of this help , i was in my last year , as a young <unk> of the year .
and i became the next line of <unk> to the next line , and the <unk> doesn &apos;t grow together .
<unk> jones , <unk> <unk> from <unk> , <unk> and social <unk> , who she never heard , and they were invited to be invited to <unk> , who they never heard , and in <unk> , their existence would never have ever imagined .
i was not familiar with the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to use the <unk> .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
i didn &apos;t know how to talk about something about anything .
i wanted to go back to the <unk> and the secret of the life of a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother , a mom , and two daughters who told each of their days as long as 20 years , when they told the stories of her day and <unk> , we still had three times in the same bed .
i said my mom , i wouldn &apos;t do that .
it reminded me that i was so old as they were at the same time , when we had the boat .
no one was never a chance .
&quot; make it easy , &quot; she said . &quot; and not what you &apos;re not . &quot;
so i was talking about <unk> and education , and the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
and the open thing i talked about , the more i wanted to tell .
i met people in all the <unk> , so many of you were doing what they wanted to die in the borders of the difference .
and even though i was talking , i realized that i could not get me with a career in <unk> .
there had to be a different <unk> .
and i realized at the same time that it &apos;s okay to be a <unk> , an <unk> , new image -- and not just okay , but something that you need to be grateful , maybe a gift of <unk> .
because <unk> can be so easy to the desert of <unk> , that &apos;s so easy to see the assumptions of the environment .
so i went out enough from my <unk> to know that , yes , the world <unk> , but not as a <unk> .
and we didn &apos;t have been allowed to be <unk> .
there was a energy , an <unk> optimism , a strange definition of the humility and the <unk> .
so i started my <unk> .
i took a little team of people to me , for which the <unk> , &quot; is not a <unk> challenge .
a year ago , we didn &apos;t have a laptop .
and at the end of one of all the <unk> , i <unk> a huge <unk> soup that we &apos;ve shared .
we worked until late in the night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but it was a couple of brilliant <unk> , and we made the breakthrough .
i met the decision to get in the united states .
after just a journey there .
my goodness again .
six months later , i was moved to the adventure , and the adventure went on .
before i go to the talk , i want to tell you about my grandmother .
it grew up to a time , in the <unk> of the social norm , and the local brothers was the most important person .
life had not changed since centuries .
her father died shortly after her birth .
her mom went to it alone .
and after 17 , she was the second woman &apos;s second woman , her mother , her mom .
without your husband , she was going to be <unk> for a <unk> , because she brought him to the dish and <unk> in her own , and a more <unk> , when they won .
&quot; i don &apos;t feel like <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m sitting in a hotel in a tent in sydney , when she died . eight kilometers away in <unk> .
i looked through the <unk> , and i saw them on the other side .
i knew that she was going to be made to look at it .
my mom called me a couple of minutes after that .
a couple of days later , we went to a <unk> temple in <unk> , and they sat around her .
we told her stories and <unk> them that we were still in their own .
after midnight , the <unk> , and he said he had to go to <unk> .
my mom asked us to do their hand .
they said , &quot; why is your hand so warm and the rest of you is so cold and the rest of you are so cold ? &quot;
&quot; because they &apos;re talking about this before , &quot; he said .
&quot; you don &apos;t have <unk> . &quot;
if there &apos;s a band of our family , it &apos;s about women .
and you can see who we were , and how the life has done us , we can see the men who might come in our lives , they would have been able to come in the <unk> .
the <unk> would be too simple .
now , i &apos;d like to be my own kids , and i think it &apos;s still the boat .
who would ever be a wish ?
yeah , i &apos;ve been afraid of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
can i give you a letter in your life , the <unk> of every wave <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the skin , the <unk> .
i don &apos;t know .
but if i could give it this , and you could make sure , i would do it .
in fact , <unk> mother today in the fourth of the fourth or fifth of them .
i &apos;m here to share my photography with them .
is it all photography ?
because , of course , this is a picture that you can &apos;t use with his camera .
now , my interest in photography , when i had my first digital structure , in the age of 15 years .
i started to draw it with my early <unk> , but it was a little bit different , because at the end of the camera , the camera was actually in <unk> .
and if you put a picture with a camera with a camera , end up the process , if you put on your wallet .
so to me , it seemed to me to go to the photography of the time to be the right place to be in the right place .
i thought everybody could do that .
so i wanted to create something different , something that &apos;s going to start when the balance is going to be .
<unk> like this : a signal is a <unk> road on a much <unk> road .
but it has an unexpected <unk> .
and <unk> is still a healthy level .
or photos like this -- dark and <unk> at the same time , but all with the common goal , a healthy level .
if i say reality , i mean <unk> .
because , of course , it &apos;s not something that you can really create , but i want to look at it just as if you could have that , on a photograph .
ladies who have to think of a brief moment to think about the trick .
so it &apos;s more important to get a idea , as really a moment .
but what is the trick that makes it a tool to look at ?
is it about the details or the colors ?
is it about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but at the same time , it &apos;s about how we make the world , and how it can be made on a <unk> surface .
it &apos;s not about what is realistic , but what we &apos;re doing for realistic .
so , i think the basics are very simple .
i see it as a puzzle of reality that you can take different pieces of the reality that you can take different pieces and create a alternative reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
we &apos;ve got three perfect <unk> different objects that we &apos;re all able to identify in a three-dimensional world .
but in a particular way , in a particular way , you can create something that is still able to be able to be able to be able to get bigger than whether it could exist .
but at the same time , we know that this is not possible .
so what we &apos;re doing is our brains , because our brain doesn &apos;t really be able to do it , it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
and i see the same process in <unk> of photos .
it &apos;s really about to combine different realities .
so the things that look at a picture , i think it &apos;s the things that we &apos;re not thinking about , the things that we &apos;re not thinking about in our lives .
but if we combine photos , it &apos;s really important to think about it , because else you can see it just kind of wrong .
so i would tell you that there are three simple rules to follow a <unk> outcome .
as you can see , these are not three special images .
but we can do something special like this , and you can do something special like this .
so the first rule is that building photographs should have been able to have the same perspective .
some of the things would be able to have photographs of the same <unk> .
and these two images , these two images , from the same height of the same altitude and the same <unk> .
third of all , it &apos;s impossible to make it possible , where the individual images start and end out by the way that you &apos;re looking at it .
it doesn &apos;t seem to say how the photograph was done .
so if you look out of color , contrast and <unk> on the <unk> of the individual images , rick <unk> , <unk> colors and disorders , we <unk> the borders between the different images , and let them look like a single photograph , even though a picture can actually have hundreds of areas .
here &apos;s another example .
you might think that this is just a movement , and the bottom part was made .
this picture is actually completely <unk> , from photographs of different places .
i &apos;m happy to create a place that &apos;s easier to create a place as a place , because you don &apos;t have to be able to take a <unk> with the ideas in his head .
but it takes a lot of pleasure .
and when i had this idea in winter , i knew that i needed a couple of months to tell them to make the different places to find the different places of the puzzle .
for example , the fish had been <unk> on a <unk> .
the <unk> comes from a different place .
the <unk> comes from a <unk> .
and yes , i even &apos;ve even got the house on the island of red <unk> to look at it .
so to get a <unk> outcome , it &apos;s been from me to be seen by planning .
i always start with a <unk> , a idea .
after that , it &apos;s about the combination of different images .
and here &apos;s a little bit very good .
and if you make good photographs , the result can be pretty beautiful , and also , very realistic .
so it &apos;s all the tools , and the only thing that makes us change is our imagination .
thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk to you about why so many electronic electronic .
and i think that the most important point is that we &apos;ve stopped to talk to our patients .
and one of the things that we &apos;ve done on the <unk> was to be a <unk> .
now , it &apos;s not particularly science -- it &apos;s a cup of coffee or tea , and i ask the patient , families , <unk> , <unk> , &quot; how is it ?
how can we help you ? &quot;
and we think we want to think that this is one of the problems , why all of you -- maybe most of the electronic .
this is my <unk> . a very simple thing .
she &apos;s got a button .
and every morning i read this .
and yes , i &apos;ve got a challenge , like you can see .
i &apos;ve got my job in 95 pounds of <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s very simple . every time i &apos;m going to go back to the <unk> , you put my data to google health care .
and they &apos;re going to be able to get out of my <unk> <unk> , so he can see where my <unk> is , and it &apos;s not just in the moment that i &apos;m going to support to be <unk> or so , but also with a look at the past .
there &apos;s something else .
maybe you know , i &apos;ve been talking about 4,000 <unk> on twitter .
so every morning i &apos;m going to talk to my <unk> and people talk to me before i &apos;m sitting in the car , &quot; to lunch for lunch , &quot; to lunch a little <unk> today , <unk> . &quot;
but this is the <unk> , which can happen because this is the <unk> , <unk> , to help patients , because that might be used against obesity , or it might be used to <unk> patients .
but it might be used to be used to get people out of their chairs , and to bring them into a different way to play their health care better .
next week comes to the market next week .
it &apos;s going to give this little <unk> that you &apos;re going to be in a iphone or so <unk> .
and it &apos;s going to allow people to measure their blood pressure , to take it to their doctor to send it to their doctor and to share him with others , for something more than 100 dollars .
and in this point , the patient comes to the game . you can &apos;t only go back to the control , <unk> on your own ship , but can also help us help health care of the challenges that we are , and the <unk> of health care , <unk> demand , and so on .
make things that are easy to use the easy thing to use , and let &apos;s start with this to give patients in the team .
and that can get them through these ways , but also by <unk> .
and one of the things we did , i want to share with you through a quick video .
we have all the <unk> in our cars .
maybe in our mobile phone .
we know exactly exactly where all of the pockets are around .
we still know what all of the <unk> are .
and sure , we can find <unk> .
but where would the next <unk> to help this patient ?
we have <unk> , and nobody knew it .
no one knew where the next is to find <unk> <unk> in this moment .
so , what did we do ? we &apos;ve been in the netherlands in the netherlands .
we &apos;ve got a website , and i asked a <unk> , &quot; if you look at a <unk> , please share with where he &apos;s on , &quot; because sometimes he &apos;s going to be published in <unk> , of course , of course .
and over 10,000 <unk> , in the netherlands , in the netherlands .
the next step was to find the apps for that .
and we &apos;ve designed a <unk> .
we &apos;ve developed a app for <unk> , transparency reality to find these <unk> .
and if you &apos;re in a city like <unk> , and someone in a city , you can use your iphone , and within the next couple of weeks , you can use their <unk> to find the next <unk> to find life .
and we don &apos;t want to think about this as <unk> , like the product is called the product , but also as <unk> .
and we want to bring this on a global level .
and we ask our colleagues on the entire world , from other universities , from other universities , to help us to help the <unk> to behave in the entire world .
and if you &apos;re in bed , and somebody &apos;s in bed , it &apos;s their own <unk> or someone else , you can find a <unk> .
the other thing that we want to ask , is that companies on the entire world we &apos;re going to help us in the entire world .
this could be <unk> , or <unk> , for example , only to make sure that the <unk> <unk> is still about his place .
please let &apos;s help them and try to make the health , not just better , but in the hand .
thank you .
today , i &apos;m going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
i work in <unk> .
and i want to use my little <unk> that we &apos;re using us to use the environment by it .
... it &apos;s <unk> <unk> .
here &apos;s a short video clip about what we &apos;re doing .
oh , a moment .
it might take it to it until it is .
now -- we can just get it out -- i &apos;m going to get the video of the video ...
no .
that &apos;s not ...
okay .
<unk> is ...
oh , my time is happened ?
okay . thank you .
so a couple of years ago , i started a program to take the stars in technology and design to get a year , and to work in a environment , which is so pretty much about what they &apos;re doing , we &apos;ve done them in the government .
the program is called &quot; code for america , &quot; and it &apos;s a little bit like the <unk> .
we choose every year , and we &apos;re going to work with <unk> .
instead of trying to send them into the third world , we send them into <unk> .
and there they developed great apps , working with urban employees .
but what they really do is to show what we &apos;re doing today with technology .
so they meet al .
al is a <unk> in the city of boston .
this is what it looks like , as if he &apos;s looking for a day , but what he really is , is someone who &apos;s <unk> him , because he knows , it &apos;s not very good in the <unk> , when he knows , he &apos;s not very good at the <unk> .
how did he come to explore this particular way to look at this particular way ?
we had a team in the last year ago in boston in boston , which is the code for america .
they were there in february , and it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
and they noticed that the city never had this <unk> <unk> .
but a particular man , a man named <unk> <unk> , was just something else , and that was that the residents that <unk> <unk> <unk> , all of these things .
so he did what everybody was supposed to do , he wrote a app .
it &apos;s a nice little app where you can <unk> a <unk> .
you <unk> it down to <unk> , if it &apos;s <unk> .
if you do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al gore .
if you don &apos;t do that , you can tell you one of them .
so there &apos;s a nice little clip .
this is a brilliant little app .
it &apos;s probably the smallest of the 21 apps that i was written in the last year .
but they &apos;re doing something that doesn &apos;t make other <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s this guy in the <unk> coast of the city , which is that he could use this app , not for snow , not for snow , but that &apos;s the citizens <unk> .
it &apos;s very important that these <unk> are working , but people get the batteries .
so he got the citizens to look at them .
and then journalists decided to use the app to use the citizens to get the citizens <unk> .
and chicago , she was just introduced to the people who <unk> the <unk> , if it &apos;s <unk> .
now , we know nine cities , which is to use this app .
and it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , of course , of course .
if you know something about <unk> , you know that it &apos;s not going to happen .
the <unk> of software takes a couple of years in the rule of the rule of a couple of years .
we had a team called the last year at a project in boston , for that three people needed six months .
and it was about a method with the parents that are able to figure out what the right public schools are for their children .
we were told later that if it would come across the normal government , it would have been taken over two years , and it would have been <unk> about two million dollars .
and that &apos;s still nothing .
now , there &apos;s a project in the galapagos , which is the <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> , and it doesn &apos;t work .
and there are projects like this on every level of government .
so a app that was written in a couple of days , and then it &apos;s taken from <unk> , which is a kind of <unk> on the bottom of the government .
it shows how the government could work better -- not more like a private company , like many people think they should be .
and not even like a <unk> , but more like the internet itself .
and that means free access , which means open and productive .
and that &apos;s important .
but more important about this app is that it represents a new generation that &apos;s the problem of government -- not as the problem of a <unk> institution , but as a problem of collective action .
and this is a very good news , because it shows that we &apos;re very good at the collective action with digital technology .
now there &apos;s a big community of people who make the tools that we need to do things that we need to do things effective together .
it &apos;s not just &quot; code for america , and there are hundreds of people in the entire country who are going to come up and <unk> , every day in their own communities .
they don &apos;t have the government .
they &apos;re extremely frustrated with her , but they don &apos;t complain about it , they repair them .
and these people know what we &apos;ve lost from the eyes .
and this is when you &apos;re all your feelings about politics and the snake , and all the other things that we &apos;re thinking about is government , in the core , in the words of tim o <unk> , &quot; what we &apos;re doing in common <unk> , &quot; what we &apos;re doing , we can &apos;t do it alone . &quot;
today , there &apos;s a lot of people from the government .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i &apos;ll tell you that you think about it because things change things .
the politics doesn &apos;t change , the government is in change .
and because the government ended up their force out of us -- <unk> them : &quot; we know the people ? &quot; -- how we think about that change .
i didn &apos;t know very much about government than i started this program .
and as many people , i thought it was mainly about the government &apos;s most important thing to choose to choose .
now , for two years , i &apos;m going to end up to the end , that it &apos;s all about <unk> .
this is the <unk> of service and information .
and you &apos;re usually going to come out when you <unk> in your city <unk> .
if you could ever have the chance to work in your <unk> , like our colleagues scott <unk> as part of the program -- in fact , you &apos;re going to see that the people who call the government of many different problems , including , including a <unk> in your house .
and so he &apos;s going to get this <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s like &quot; <unk> , &quot; in the official database .
and he didn &apos;t really have a idea . he starts with the <unk> .
and finally , he says , &quot; look , can you just open all the doors in your house , and you see a very <unk> music , and you can see if the <unk> <unk> ? &quot;
and that worked . <unk> for scott .
but this was not the end of the <unk> .
china doesn &apos;t only have a call .
it has a app , a <unk> and <unk> , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
we didn &apos;t call this app .
that &apos;s the work of very important people in the office of the new western <unk> in boston .
one day -- this is a perfect report -- this is actually , &quot; <unk> in my <unk> . i can &apos;t tell you whether it &apos;s dead .
how do i get it out ? &quot;
but what happens with &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; is different .
scott wrote from man to human beings .
but on &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; it &apos;s all public , so that everybody can see it .
and in this case , it looked like a neighbor .
and the next chart we &apos;ve got was , &quot; i went there over there , &quot; i went there over the house , the <unk> behind the house .
<unk> ? yes , alive ? <unk> .
and then the <unk> on the side , went home .
good evening , unhappy <unk> .
pretty simple .
this is great . this is the digital .
and it &apos;s also a good example of how the government is going to be in the <unk> .
but it &apos;s also a great example of the government as a platform .
and i don &apos;t necessarily mean a technical definition of the platform .
i want to talk more about a platform for people to help yourself and help others .
a citizen helped a different citizen , but the government played a central role here .
they &apos;re using these two people .
and you &apos;d have to connect them with hemisphere , if this needed had to be , but a neighbor is a long better and <unk> alternative to the state services .
if a neighbor helps the other , we create our communities .
let &apos;s call the <unk> , it costs a lot of money .
one of the most important things is that we need to think that government is not the same as politics .
and most people understand what they believe is that one is the data of the other .
it &apos;s our contribution to the system that we choose .
how often we have a political leader -- and sometimes we &apos;ve used a lot of energy to choose to choose a new political leader -- and then we &apos;re going back and we expect that the government , our values , and then it doesn &apos;t change much change ?
that &apos;s because the government is like a further ocean , and politics are the top .
and what &apos;s inside of this is what we call 83 .
and we use this word with this word .
but it &apos;s these <unk> that this thing that we have , and we pay for what we pay for us to do something that &apos;s working against us , something else , and then we <unk> ourselves .
people seem to think , politics is sexy .
if we want this institution for us , we need to make <unk> sexy sexy .
because that &apos;s where the actual <unk> is happening .
we need to be in the root of government .
so the <unk> has done it .
have you seen these guys ?
it &apos;s a group of more rich citizens that wrote a very <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is a answer to the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
this is not the difficult model , that &apos;s <unk> .
now , for those of us who have been the government , it &apos;s time that we want to think about the world we want to leave our children .
you &apos;ve got to tell you the enormous challenges that you have to imagine .
do we really think that we &apos;re going to achieve what we need to do without improve a institution that is in the names of us in the names of all of us ?
one government is absolutely necessary , but it has to be more efficient .
the good news is that technology is possible to make the function of government , in a way that can actually achieve something that can actually achieve the society .
and there are a generation that grew up the <unk> internet , and the knowledge that it is not so hard to do things together , you have to build the only right systems .
now , the age of our <unk> is 28 , so i am , unfortunately , almost a generation older than most of you .
this is a generation that grew up to be able to see their voice as granted .
they don &apos;t fight this fight that we &apos;re all talking about , to talk about who &apos;s going to talk , they &apos;re all going to talk about .
you can think of your opinion , on every way to everybody , and they &apos;re doing it .
so , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> with the problem of government , you don &apos;t want to use your voices .
they use their hands .
they use their hands to write applications that make the work of government .
and these apps let us use our hands to improve our communities to improve our communities .
this might be a <unk> <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
and sure , we would have got these <unk> <unk> all the time , and many people are doing this .
but these apps are like small digital memories that we &apos;re not only the consumers , and we &apos;re not only the consumers of the government to pay <unk> and <unk> .
we &apos;re more than that , we are citizens .
and we &apos;re not going to improve government , until we &apos;re able to improve the script better .
so the question i mean for you all here : if it &apos;s about the big , important things that we have to do together , all together , we &apos;re going to be a lot of voices , or are we going to be a lot of hands ?
thank you .
in fact , my role is to explain people like wonderful the new technologies that are going to be in the brain , and i thought , because i &apos;m trying to look back in the friends , i would tell you what i really think , and try to see what &apos;s happening here , with this incredible <unk> , which is so quickly that we can &apos;t imagine .
i &apos;m going to start to show you just a single thing to show boring slide .
you might just show the slide on the slide .
this is a slide that i &apos;d like to do from my <unk> .
it &apos;s not about the details of the slide of the slide , but it &apos;s about the <unk> shape .
and this slide shows data from a analysis from the performance of <unk> <unk> than the performance of a <unk> level of networks .
the interesting thing here is that this slide is , like this slide , which we often think in our field , a kind of <unk> curve .
in other words , every step here , every step here is a <unk> in the <unk> .
and this is an observation that we have to use this guy on <unk> curves in the area of technology .
a very strange thing happened here .
this is essentially what i &apos;m going to talk about here .
so , if you could put the light back down .
and there &apos;s something like this , because i &apos;m going to see something on the paper here .
now , why do we draw graphs in the technology on <unk> curves ?
so the reason is that if i would draw it on a normal curve , where , you know , this is the years , the <unk> of a way , and this is a <unk> part of the technology that i want to show with a graph , then the graph is ridiculous .
and then you see this .
and that doesn &apos;t tell us a lot .
now , if i want to show a different technology , we &apos;re going to tell you a <unk> , and then it would be on the <unk> scale , in the form of a flat line .
but if something like this is happening here , it changes the <unk> circumstances .
so , if you were able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> , we could get <unk> in a bed , and we would be in 30 seconds , in 30 seconds , we would be in tokyo .
but it &apos;s not so fast .
it never had before in the history of the <unk> , this kind of <unk> growth , which is the scale of <unk> growth , by which the size of all sorts of years .
now , the question i want to ask you is when you look at these exponential curves , you see , you &apos;re not going to go too much .
it &apos;s not possible that all of all of us , and so fast as quickly as fast as well .
there are two possibilities .
it &apos;s going to be able to get a classic <unk> like here , until something completely new , or it &apos;s going to happen here .
this is about it .
well , i &apos;m an antidote , so i think that &apos;s how this is going to happen in the way there &apos;s going to happen .
is that really , it means that we &apos;re in the moment in the middle of a transition .
we &apos;re here on this line , in a transition from the world &apos;s world in a new kind of world .
so the question i want to imagine , and i also like to ask myself , is how this new world is going to be ?
what is this new state that makes the world slowly <unk> ?
because the transition seems to be very , very confusing , if you &apos;re in the middle of it .
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere in the year 2000 , and people often talked about what was going to happen in 2000 .
now we &apos;ve got a conference where people talk about the future , and you realize that the future is still a year ago .
we &apos;re not going to do that .
so in other words , the future is about a year ago since i was in the world .
and i think the reason for that is that we realize that something is happening .
the transition happens . we can understand it all .
and we know that there &apos;s just no sense to try to look at 30 or 50 years in the future , because everything is going to be so different that a simple <unk> of what we &apos;re doing now is not a sense of what we &apos;re doing now .
i want to talk about what that might be , this transition in which we are now .
so to do this , i &apos;m going to talk about some other things that really don &apos;t really talk about technology or computers .
because i think about this really , we have to go back to a step back , and we &apos;re going to look at the thing on a longer <unk> .
and i want to look at this on the <unk> of life &apos;s life .
i think the amazing thing is that if you use it in some <unk> .
so let &apos;s go back , and it &apos;s 800 billion years . the earth was a big , <unk> <unk> <unk> with many of the <unk> chemicals .
now , if you look at the way that these chemicals were <unk> , there &apos;s a pretty good image about how it &apos;s called the <unk> .
and i think there are theories that start to understand how all of it started , but i &apos;m going to tell you a <unk> story of what &apos;s going on to this time , and i &apos;m going to tell you that this time is a little <unk> , which has different kinds of <unk> of chemicals for chemicals .
some of these <unk> had a special combination of chemicals that allows them to be able to integrate other chemicals from the ground and so forth .
all the things that were done was made .
these little <unk> were in the sense of <unk> <unk> .
but they were not about the world &apos;s <unk> , because every single one of them was just a little bit , <unk> recipe of chemicals .
and every time , if it &apos;s been taught , they have <unk> chemicals to reduce food .
so every <unk> was a little bit different .
in fact , the <unk> , which is one for the growth of <unk> composition , faster than other , and <unk> more and more chemicals from the ground and they were faster .
so this is how to survive longer , and they <unk> it in <unk> potential .
so this is just a very simple chemical form of life , but more interesting is that if this <unk> has learned a trick about abstraction .
in any ways we don &apos;t understand that we don &apos;t understand , these <unk> <unk> the ability to make information .
they learned to make the recipe of the cell as a information , and that &apos;s in a certain chemical form that we call dna .
in other words , they have seen in this <unk> , evolutionary kind of a way that allowed them to do , <unk> what they were doing , so that this information could be <unk> and <unk> .
and the amazing thing about this is that this kind of information is to make information about 2.5 billion years ago where they were in the same time .
in fact , the recipe for us , which is our genes , from the right same code and the same <unk> .
and this is all the world that &apos;s going to be able to do the same letters and the same code .
we &apos;re so much that we have to write , only to the <unk> , to write ourselves in this code .
and i &apos;ve got 100 <unk> <unk> of a white <unk> , which i &apos;m trying to think in airports of <unk> .
in fact , what i &apos;ve done is , i &apos;ve got this code -- the code is from normal letters , which we use to use the <unk> -- and i wrote my <unk> on a piece of dna , and i had 10 <unk> 22 times .
so if someone wants to be a hundred million copies of my <unk> , i &apos;ve got enough for everybody in this room and even for everybody on this world , and it &apos;s right here .
i was in fact , in fact , in fact , i had written them on a virus , and i wrote it into a virus .
so what is the next step ?
the <unk> of dna was an interesting step .
and the <unk> of these cells -- that made them happy for another billion years .
but then there was another , very interesting step on which things were completely different , and that &apos;s why we began to communicate these cells and deal with information , so that communities made out of cells .
i don &apos;t know if you knew that , but bacteria can actually change their dna .
this is also the reason for example of why it grows to antibiotics .
now , some bacteria found how they can get out of innovation , and we &apos;ve got this information together with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria , which is more <unk> , because the bacteria communicate with each other , because the bacteria communicate with each other .
so this communication allows us to have communities , which was in some sense in the same boat ; they were <unk> .
so they &apos;re either going to survive , or they went together , and that meant that when a community was successful , all the individuals were successful , all the individuals of the community are more <unk> , and the evolution of evolution .
the <unk> is now there , where these communities are so close , they decided that they decided to write the recipe for the entire community in a <unk> to write the dna .
and the next exciting phase , about a more billion years ago , about a hundred billion years .
and in this time , we have <unk> communities , communities of many <unk> <unk> , which are in the same way as a single organism .
so , in fact , we are a <unk> community .
we have a lot of cells , which is not going to be <unk> .
your skin cells are useless without the heart , water , brains and so forth .
so this communities began to be <unk> , so that the level of what evolution was in , not longer the individual cell , but the entire <unk> of which we call the organism .
the next step happened in this communities .
the <unk> began to <unk> information .
and they developed special structures that are not doing anything else as information within the organism .
and this is the neural structure .
so the neurons are the <unk> of the <unk> that these <unk> have built .
they started <unk> in the community , special structures that were responsible for learning to learn , understand , understanding information .
and this was the brain and the nervous nervous system .
this was a evolutionary advantage .
because for this time , a single individual -- learning happened within the time of a single organism , instead of a single organism , instead of this evolutionary time .
so , a organism could learn , for example , to learn a certain thing , because they didn &apos;t get sick , because they were bad , and he made him sick , the last time he ate them .
now , this could happen within the life of a single organism , whereas before tens of thousands of years ago , because this information has had to learn from the individuals , which is because these information died , there was no one .
so , the nervous system has been <unk> with this special <unk> , because evolution could actually happen within a individual .
it could happen within a <unk> .
what happened after that , is that the individual organisms found a way to communicate with each other .
and for example , as example , the <unk> of us was known version of this <unk> , the human language is the human language .
it &apos;s a really amazing invention when you think about it .
i have a very complicated , <unk> and <unk> idea in my head .
i &apos;m sitting here , and it &apos;s basically <unk> sounds from me to create a similar <unk> idea in your head , to create a similar strange idea with my original idea .
so we take something very complicated , it &apos;s in sound to sound , a sequence of sound , and they create something very complicated in the head of others .
so this allows us to work as a negative organism .
and what we actually did , we know , the humanity , is that we &apos;ve been doing it .
we &apos;re going to go down the same , which is <unk> -- the abstraction of our ways of how we make data , to explore , process .
the invention of the language , for example , was a little step in this direction .
<unk> , the computer , <unk> , <unk> , and so on all of our <unk> mechanisms that we built in our community to create this information .
and it connects us all together with something that is much bigger , and also can also be able to develop faster than we were .
so today , evolution can happen in the same time .
and they also saw <unk> little <unk> where he saw a little evolution in the <unk> &apos;s program , right in front of your eyes .
so , we &apos;ve got the <unk> <unk> again .
the first steps about the story i told you , <unk> a billion years per piece .
the next steps , like the nervous system and the brain , a few hundred million years .
then the <unk> steps , like language and so forth , <unk> less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be a few decades ago .
the process depends on itself , and it &apos;s going to be , i think , <unk> is the word for -- if something is <unk> .
the more it changes , the faster change it changes .
and i think that &apos;s what we see here in this <unk> curve .
we see the process that &apos;s going to get out of itself .
i live with the organization of computers , and i know that i can use the mechanism that i use to use computers , not to use computers , without the fact that we were able to use progress in computing .
my current process is to design objects with such a very high complexity that it doesn &apos;t seem to do for me to make this in the traditional sense .
i don &apos;t know what every single laptop in the <unk> is doing .
it has billions of whom .
what i do instead of do , and what &apos;s also the designers of thinking of thinking , is we think of a certain <unk> , this is the machine , and the machine is doing something that we could even react to our skills , better and faster than we could ever do it .
and it makes it partly with ways that we &apos;re not going to understand right now .
one of the things that is particularly interesting , and what i &apos;ve been often used in the last time , evolution is evolution .
this is how we put a <unk> in the machine , which is going to happen in the <unk> .
to call a example , in the most extreme cases , we can create a program that has evolved from random <unk> .
we say , &quot; computers , <unk> , a hundred million times a hundred million <unk> .
now , i &apos;m going to do all this <unk> <unk> , <unk> all of the programs , and they finally choose the people who are the next one . &quot;
so , in other words , i mean , what i want to do .
let &apos;s say , i want to represent numbers , that would be a simple example that i &apos;ve done with it .
so , so some of the principles that represent numbers can happen .
of course , of course , the opportunity to happen is very small , that it &apos;s very small that you can &apos;t be able to make number numbers , so you &apos;re not going to be able to do this .
but one of which may be more lucky to have two numbers in the right vision .
now i &apos;m going to say , &quot; computers , you &apos;re going to take the 10 percent of the <unk> , which is the next one .
and this is the <unk> , <unk> the rest of the rest .
now , all of the <unk> <unk> that are the numbers that have numbers in the world .
and this is a way of a way of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you have two programs , and they produce children through the exchange of their <unk> , and the children are <unk> the characteristics of the <unk> of the two programs .
so , i &apos;ve got a new generation of programs that came through combinations of programs that have a little bit closer to the <unk> than other .
tell , &quot; please take this process . &quot;
put it back .
you might have some mutations .
and try this whole time with a different generation .
all of these generations need only a few milliseconds .
and so i can use a evolution about millions of years in the computer in a lot of days , or a lot of a lot of hours .
after all , i &apos;m going to get some programs that are different to be able to do the numbers perfect .
in fact , these programs are so much more efficient than any program that i &apos;ve ever had to write from hand .
so if i look at these programs , i can &apos;t tell you how they work .
i tried to understand them .
it &apos;s confused and strange programs .
but they &apos;re doing the job .
i know , i &apos;m really sure that they &apos;re doing the job because they come from a series of <unk> programs that have done the job .
because your life was coming out of whether they did the job right .
i sat down in a <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , he <unk> a map , and he says , &quot; oh , look at this . look at this . look at this . look at this . look at this .
this is , &quot; this plane is made by <unk> <unk> , which are working together to make their flight safer . &quot; don &apos;t do it ? &quot;
we know that an <unk> is not <unk> if it &apos;s too complicated .
so we &apos;re starting to go to the computer , for a process , which is to be different from the classic <unk> .
it allows us to do things with a much higher complexity than it would allow the normal ways to produce .
and yet , we don &apos;t understand the possibilities of that .
so , <unk> <unk> the technology .
we use these programs now to make the computers much faster , so that we can be able to make these processes faster .
so there &apos;s a <unk> .
it becomes faster and faster , and i think that &apos;s why it seems so confusing .
because all these new technologies of today are going to feed themselves .
we &apos;re going to raise vegetables .
we &apos;re at a point that &apos;s in a point that &apos;s going to have evolved in the time as a <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;re the <unk> , and we can &apos;t see what the hell we &apos;re doing here is to create .
we &apos;re in the middle of this <unk> .
but i really believe that after a little bit .
i think it &apos;s very <unk> of us to tell us that we are the beginning of evolution .
and i think we all have here are part of the creation of what &apos;s going on as next .
now , lunch is before , and i think i &apos;m going to hear here before i &apos;m going to <unk> .
my story starts right here in <unk> , about two years ago .
i was under the <unk> in the desert in the desert with <unk> ali ali .
we talked about this that nothing has changed since the ancient indian <unk> . &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if we wanted to travel the indian time , we were going to go into a car and <unk> over the sky .
now we &apos;re going to do this with the wild .
at the same time , when the big indian <unk> was <unk> <unk> , he took a <unk> , sent into the floor and water .
now we &apos;re doing this with <unk> and machines .
so we came to the conclusion that magic and magic is made by machines .
that was really happy .
i got a little bit scared of technology .
and i realized that i could lose the ability to be able to enjoy the <unk> , without camera , and without <unk> to my friends .
i found that technology should be able to make magic , not kill .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little <unk> <unk> .
this piece of 50 years old technology became the <unk> thing for me .
it became a <unk> access to a world full of <unk> and <unk> ships , and in my view , in my view .
i was like this , as i asked us to get our <unk> and cameras out of it .
they were inspired by being inspired by it .
and so i went to the world of technology to see how i could use them to make magic magic rather than kill it .
after 16 , i started talking books .
when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a device that can connect the readers on the world .
we can know how to do it .
we can know where we are .
it takes pictures and text together , and animation , sounds and touch .
the beauty needed to have more senses .
but what do we do ?
i &apos;m just going to go to <unk> , a interactive event .
this is : &quot; take your fingers on every light . &quot;
and so -- here &apos;s : &quot; this box heard ... &quot; i write my name .
and i &apos;m going to get a character in the book .
and again , there &apos;s a letter for me down to me -- and the ipad knows by gps where i live -- that &apos;s right to me .
the child in me is really excited about this possibilities .
i &apos;ve talked a lot about magic .
i mean , i don &apos;t mean <unk> , but the magic of childhood , these ideas that we all had as children had .
in a glass of glass , i found always exciting .
this is what you have to do here with the ipad and <unk> the <unk> .
and the <unk> of the way through the rest of the book .
the other idea that i &apos;ve been fascinated with was a kid , that a whole galaxy can be in a single <unk> .
and so every book is going to be in the room , and every world is a little <unk> , which i &apos;m going to do here with the magic device in the device .
and this opens up a map .
<unk> had always been maps , but these cards were static .
this map is growing and <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> in the rest of the book .
it turns out on other places of the book .
i go up here .
and it &apos;s important for me to create something that <unk> is , but it &apos;s also very <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
we &apos;ve all heard of <unk> and <unk> , but how many people outside india knows their indian colleagues , the <unk> ?
the poor <unk> were taken thousands of years in <unk> <unk> , in a old <unk> book .
and we bring them back to a <unk> story for children .
so one story that &apos;s going to be <unk> with new issues like the <unk> .
the theme of <unk> , a big problem of the last 10 years is that kids sit in their <unk> , to their computers , without you .
but now , with security technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology .
in a interaction of the book , you &apos;re going to send you to a search . you &apos;ve got to go back to the camera , and you &apos;ve got to go through the camera of the <unk> images of natural objects .
when i had a kid , i had <unk> <unk> , rocks , <unk> and <unk> .
we don &apos;t make children anymore .
this <unk> is going to be <unk> . you &apos;ve got to go to a chapter a photograph of a photograph of a flower and <unk> .
in one other chapter , you have to have a piece of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
so you actually create a digital collection of photos that you can put online online .
a kid in london shows the image of a <unk> , and he says , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve seen a deck . &quot;
a kid in india says , &quot; now , today i &apos;ve seen a result . &quot;
it creates a kind of social network around a digital collection of photos that you actually &apos;ve actually taken .
there &apos;s a variety of possibilities about magic to connect the world and technology .
in the next book , we &apos;re going to make a interaction where you use the video of the <unk> , and through <unk> reality , there is a animation that looks like a animation on the house .
on one point , the screen is <unk> .
you &apos;ve got to do the sound of the <unk> , you just read and read the rest of the book .
we all move to a world where the energy of the technology is closer , and in the magic and technology can continue .
we use the energy of the sun .
we bring our children and make us closer to the natural world , and the magic , fun and the love of our childhood through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
this is really an extraordinary honor for me .
i spend most of my time with people in <unk> , mountains or <unk> .
i spend most of my time with the social <unk> in the <unk> and in places where there are very much <unk> .
this is going to be at ted , to see , and to hear how <unk> that is , i &apos;ve got a lot of power .
in the short time here , i was a clear thing to me : ted has a identity .
you can tell things that have the world &apos;s influence .
and sometimes , if something about ted comes out of ted , it gets a meaning and force that it doesn &apos;t even exist .
i say this , because i think that identity is very important .
we &apos;ve seen some amazing of the amazing colleagues .
i believe that we learned that the words of a career , but that &apos;s the words of a <unk> wish , but the words of a mathematician .
as a doctor , you can do good . as a <unk> doctor , you can do more .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
i didn &apos;t have the way in my work as a lawyer .
i learned that from my grandmother .
i became big in a family , a traditional <unk> household , who was <unk> by a <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> was my grandmother .
she was a <unk> , strong woman , she had the effect .
she had the last word in every <unk> .
it was also the beginning of many differences in our family .
she was the daughter of a <unk> .
their parents were born in the <unk> in virginia as <unk> .
it was born by <unk> , and the experience of slavery was very strong .
my grandmother was strong , but it was also <unk> .
when i met her as a little boy , she came up to me and <unk> me .
so , i realized that i could hardly breathe . and then she was able to go back to me .
one or two hours later , when i met her , she came up to me and said , &quot; <unk> , do you feel like that ? &quot;
and if i said , &quot; no one said to me . if i said , &quot; i said , &quot; i said , &quot; she said to me .
it was something that was doing something that was always going to be in their own .
the only problem was that she had 10 children .
my mom was the youngest of their old children .
sometimes , if i wanted to spend time with her , it was hard to get your attention .
my cousins were everywhere everywhere .
i remember , i &apos;ve got to be eight or nine or nine , that i woke up a morning , and all my cousins came around .
my grandmother was sitting at the end of the <unk> , and i went to my grandmother .
first of all , i thought that &apos;s a game .
i looked at it and <unk> , but she looked very seriously .
this was so 15 or 20 minutes , and then she came back to me , and she took me back to me , and she said , &quot; come , <unk> . you and i have to talk about it . &quot;
i remember , as if it was yesterday .
i &apos;m never going to forget it .
she took me out , and he said , &quot; <unk> , i &apos;m going to tell you something , but you &apos;ve got to make sure you &apos;ve got to do it . &quot;
i said , &quot; please , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; <unk> ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
and she sat down to me , and she looked at me . she said , &quot; i want you to see that i &apos;ve seen you . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you &apos;re doing something special . &quot;
she said , &quot; i think you can do everything you want to do . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget that .
and then she said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to get three things , <unk> . &quot;
i said , &quot; ok , grandmother . &quot;
she said , &quot; well , as the first <unk> i want you to love your mama . &quot;
she said , &quot; your mom is my baby , and you &apos;ve got to do with the promise that you &apos;re going to be alive . &quot;
i ask my mom , so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother , that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; well , as the next <unk> , you &apos;re always going to do the right thing . &quot; even if it &apos;s hard to do the right thing . &quot;
i thought , and i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
and finally , she said , &quot; the last thing you &apos;ve got to promise is that you &apos;re never going to drink alcohol . &quot;
well , i was nine years old , and so i said , &quot; yes , grandmother . i promise it . &quot;
i grew up on the country , in the old , rural south , and i have a brother who &apos;s a year older and a year ago .
when i was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home , and i took this <unk> beer , and i went to my sister , and i went to the woods with us in the woods .
we only put it out there just like that .
then he took a <unk> reef , and he took my sister one , and she took up , and then she took me one .
i said , &quot; no , no , no . i don &apos;t want it . i don &apos;t want a beer . &quot;
my brother said , &quot; well , i &apos;m going to do that . we &apos;re doing that , you know , we &apos;re doing anything else that we &apos;re doing .
i had what they had , her sister had a beer . &quot;
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t want to do . it just does it . &quot;
my brother went to me .
he said , &quot; well , what &apos;s going on with you ? now <unk> . &quot;
and then he looked at me in the face and said , &quot; oh no , you don &apos;t do you still don &apos;t always do crazy because of the conversation with grandmother ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot;
he said , &quot; grandmother told all of you that they &apos;re interested in what &apos;s special . &quot;
i was destroyed the floor .
i &apos;m going to tell you something .
i didn &apos;t want to do that .
this is probably going to be <unk> .
i &apos;m six years old , and i <unk> , i never got a drop of alcohol .
i don &apos;t say that because i think it &apos;s <unk> . i say this , because identity is what it means .
if we create the right way of identity , we can tell people about things that they don &apos;t believe .
we can get them to do things that they thought they wouldn &apos;t be .
of course , my grandmother would tell all their ancestors , they &apos;re doing something special .
my grandfather was in jail during the <unk> in jail .
my uncle died of <unk> diseases .
and they believed that this is the issues that we need to do .
i tried to say something about our <unk> .
this country is different than 40 years ago .
rwanda was 300,000 people in <unk> and in jail .
today , it &apos;s <unk> million .
the united states today have the highest <unk> of the world .
seven million people are on <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
now , i think we &apos;re actually changing our world <unk> .
in social <unk> and black parts of the population of the population , despair and torture , because of these changes .
one of three male black miles between 18 and 30 is in <unk> , in jail , in jail , in the <unk> , or with <unk> <unk> .
in urban communities all over the country -- from los angeles to washington , <unk> to washington -- there are 50 to 60 percent of all black men in <unk> , in jail , in jail , and <unk> <unk> .
our system is not only <unk> by questions that are going to be able to do with <unk> , it &apos;s going to be <unk> by poverty .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> , which is going to be treated much better if they &apos;re rich and guilty as poor and innocent .
<unk> , not <unk> , is the result .
instead , we seem to be honest with that .
a politics of fear and anger has convinced us believe that these problems are not our problems .
we &apos;ve lost that .
i think that &apos;s interesting .
there &apos;s a couple of <unk> creatures .
my home in the home , <unk> , <unk> the <unk> , if you &apos;re going to be <unk> .
here , now , in alabama , 20 percent of the male of the little black population is lost their <unk> .
we <unk> that in 10 years ago , the <unk> of the <unk> of the u.s. <unk> is so high as the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> .
the word is <unk> .
i <unk> children .
many of my students are very young .
the united states of america are the only country in the world , the <unk> kids to death in jail .
in this our country , there &apos;s a lot of children in this country for children &apos;s <unk> .
we &apos;ve already got a lot of <unk> .
the only country in the world .
i <unk> people in <unk> .
the question of the <unk> is a interesting question .
we think , because you &apos;ve taught us that the real question is : has a human question to die for a <unk> crime ?
this is a very <unk> question .
you can also think different about thinking about how we see our identity .
the other thing is not : have someone to have the death of death , but , you know , have to kill it to kill ?
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
the <unk> in america is defined by error .
and after nine people that we &apos;ve been launched , one of the things that we &apos;ve been obsessed with , is one that we &apos;ve got for pity , the <unk> and from the death of death .
an amazing <unk> . one of nine .
i think that &apos;s fascinating .
we would never get someone to fly with a plane , if for nine planes , who &apos;s going to go .
but somehow we create it out of this problem .
it &apos;s not our problem .
it &apos;s not our initiative .
it &apos;s not our fight .
i talk a lot about these questions .
i &apos;m talking about conflict and the question , whether we have it right to kill .
and it &apos;s exciting , because i &apos;m talking to my students <unk> story . i &apos;m talking about slavery .
i &apos;m talking about terrorism , the time against the end of the <unk> , until the beginning of the second world war .
we don &apos;t really know much about that .
but for the <unk> in this country , it was a time of terror .
in many areas , people had to be afraid of <unk> .
or bombs .
it was the fear of terror that you have in their lives .
now , these older people come to me and say , &quot; mr. , <unk> , they talk to me , you &apos;re talking about talking . you &apos;re telling people to stop it in the first time in the history of our nation with terrorism : after 9 / 11 . &quot;
they say , &quot; no -- tell people that we grew up with it . &quot;
and after terrorism , of course , of course , the <unk> and decades of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and yet , in our country , there &apos;s a dynamic -- we don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
we don &apos;t like to talk about our story .
and that &apos;s why we don &apos;t really understand what we did in the historical context .
we &apos;re all over the time all over the time .
we &apos;re always able to create new tension and conflict .
it &apos;s hard to talk about conflict , and i think that &apos;s because we &apos;re not going to be able to get the process of truth and <unk> .
in south africa , people have understood that the <unk> is not going to be able to overcome the willingness to the truth and <unk> .
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness , but not in this our country .
i have some of the talks in germany about the <unk> .
it was fascinating , because one of the scientists came up after my talk , and he said , &quot; you know , it &apos;s really dramatic to hear them . &quot;
he said , &quot; in germany , there is no death .
and of course , it can never give them more . &quot;
it was pretty simple , and then a woman said , &quot; well , the wife , it &apos;s impossible that we &apos;ve ever been able to be able to get us back to the <unk> of people .
it would be <unk> by us , that &apos;s the <unk> of us . &quot;
i thought about it .
as it would feel like to live in a world in which the german state of state of state &apos;s state , especially , if there were a lot of jews .
it would be <unk> .
it would be <unk> .
and yet , here in this country , in this country , in the states of the old <unk> , we see people -- here &apos;s the risk of death , 11 times higher , if the victims is , as if it &apos;s black . 22 times higher than the <unk> black , in the same states , in the same states , in their earth .
and yet , there &apos;s this mental <unk> .
i think our identity is <unk> .
if we don &apos;t deal with this hard issues , the positive issues , the positive and wonderful things are also affected .
we love innovation .
we love technology and creativity .
we love entertainment .
but finally , these realities are <unk> by love , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and i was thinking it &apos;s important to connect both of the time .
because we &apos;re trying to talk about that we need more hope , more <unk> , more <unk> , to be in a complex world .
so for me to think about the time to think , and to talk about the poor , the <unk> , who are never going to be in ted .
but think of a way of a way that our own life is evolving in our own life .
we all have to believe that we can &apos;t see things that we can &apos;t see .
we &apos;re doing this . so we &apos;re doing that , so we &apos;re <unk> .
innovation , creativity , and development are not only from our head .
they come from ideas that are driven by the belief in our hearts .
it &apos;s this <unk> , which i believe that they &apos;re not just <unk> , not only to be open for all the <unk> and <unk> things , but also for the dark and <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , the great <unk> politicians , once said , &quot; well .
and when we were in europe against oppression , we wanted to do everything . but what we &apos;ve got to do is hope , and what we &apos;ve been doing is hope to be hope , a mental <unk> , the willingness to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to survive .
this <unk> is the core of what i believe is that the <unk> of what i believe is that the <unk> .
and there is no impact of technology and design that allows us to be interested in and to be human , as long as we don &apos;t also get eyes and ears for poverty , <unk> and injustice .
and i want to warn you . this kind of identity shows a lot more from us than if we don &apos;t have been talking about it .
they &apos;re going to touch them .
as a young lawyer , i <unk> the big privilege to meet pink parks .
now , south parks came back back to <unk> , where they were two of their oldest friends , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- and virginia <unk> -- and virginia <unk> , a white , her husband , <unk> <unk> , dr. king <unk> , dr. king <unk> .
so these women have met , and i just talked about it .
back to a woman , and i said to me , and i said , &quot; <unk> , wife parks in the city , we want to talk about . we want to talk about it .
do you like <unk> and listen ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; yes , i want to do . &quot;
she said , &quot; and what are you going to do when you &apos;re here ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to hear . &quot;
and i went across and i heard about it .
it was always so inspiring , so <unk> .
one day i was sitting there , and i heard these women , and after a few hours , a woman turned out to me , and i said , &quot; well <unk> , tell me what the <unk> initiative is right .
what do you try to achieve ? &quot;
i started with my usual talk .
i said , &quot; we &apos;re trying to do cooperation .
<unk> wants to help people who were nuts .
we want to fight intelligence and <unk> in the <unk> .
we want <unk> <unk> without a <unk> <unk> for children .
we want to do something against the <unk> company .
we want to get the number of millions .
we want <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i asked my usual talk , and after that , she looked at me and said , &quot; <unk> . <unk> . &quot;
she said , &quot; this is going to be very , very depressed . &quot;
and then the wife <unk> <unk> to me , i put a fingers on my face and said , &quot; and so that &apos;s why they have to be very , very <unk> . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i think the ted was supposed to be <unk> .
we need to ask ways to ask us the challenges : these problems , this is sorry .
because finally , our humanity , from our human humanity .
in my work , i &apos;ve learned quite simple things .
i learned a couple of simple things .
that we &apos;re all more more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
i think that &apos;s true for each people on the planet .
if someone &apos;s thinking , he &apos;s not just a <unk> .
if someone takes something to him , it &apos;s not just a <unk> .
depending on who someone &apos;s selling , is not just a <unk> .
and because this is why there &apos;s a fundamental human being to protect the law .
i believe that in many parts of this country , and with security in many parts of the earth , the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don &apos;t think that .
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that even though it &apos;s so dramatic , as beautiful and inspiring , we &apos;re not going to be in the end of our technology , not to the things that we &apos;re doing , not in our minds and mind .
after all , a society is not going to be a society , as they were treated their rich and powerful and insight , but what they &apos;re doing with the poor , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
because in this context , we &apos;re going to start to understand the very amazing things that you &apos;re doing .
sometimes i get the balance . a story to finish .
sometimes i urge you too much .
i &apos;m going to do tired of how we all do .
sometimes these ideas are going to think of our thinking , in a very important way .
i <unk> these children who have been <unk> to be very painful .
i &apos;m going to go to the <unk> , and i &apos;m going to be a student who &apos;s 13 or 14 years old , and that &apos;s as a adult .
so i ask myself , how could that happen ?
how can a judge somebody in something that he doesn &apos;t is ?
the judge looked at him as adults , but i see a child .
so , at night , i got to go to a long time , and i thought , my goodness , if a judge can transform us in something else , it has to have <unk> .
right , <unk> , the judge has <unk> .
you should be able to tell you what to do .
and because it was late , and i couldn &apos;t think less right now , i started to work on a <unk> .
i had a <unk> , poor black young young young boy .
and i started with this <unk> . the <unk> said , &quot; <unk> , my poor , <unk> black <unk> like a answers , white , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
in my <unk> , i explained that <unk> of the <unk> and the police and the police .
there was a crazy line about that in this country , in this country , there &apos;s nothing more <unk> that there &apos;s only been <unk> .
at the next morning , i woke up , and i didn &apos;t know if i was able to be able to do this crazy <unk> , or it was actually written .
and i didn &apos;t have it only written him , but i didn &apos;t have to go back to the court .
a couple of months came back , and i &apos;ve just forgotten everything .
but finally , i decided my god , i have to be in the court , and i &apos;ve got this crazy case .
i went to the car , and i was really proud of -- it &apos;s <unk> .
so i went to the court .
and i thought that &apos;s going to be so hard , so painful .
and finally , i went from my car , and i went to the <unk> to the court .
when i was the staircase to the court , there was a older , black man , the <unk> in the dish .
when he looked at me , he came to me and said , &quot; who are you ? &quot;
i said , &quot; i &apos;m a lawyer . &quot; he said , &quot; she &apos;s a lawyer ? &quot; i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
he came up to me and <unk> me .
then he <unk> me in the ear .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m so proud of them . &quot;
and i have to say , there was me .
it took something very deep in me , identity , the ability of every single one , to make something to a community , to a perspective of hope .
well , i ended up the <unk> .
once the judge looked at me .
he said , &quot; mr. <unk> , did you have this crazy <unk> ? &quot;
i said , &quot; yes . &quot; and then we started to discuss .
and more people came in , just because they were angry .
i had written this crazy stuff .
<unk> came up in and <unk> <unk> and students .
<unk> was the <unk> of people who were angry , who were angry , that we talked about skin skin languages , about poverty , about inequality .
and i saw the <unk> , i saw the <unk> , and i &apos;m going to go down the <unk> .
he always looked back through the window , and i could hear the whole <unk> .
he went down and down .
and finally , this older black man came up with a very <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and i sat in the <unk> behind me , almost on the <unk> .
10 minutes later , the judge was a <unk> .
during the day , a <unk> came in , which was that the <unk> was in the <unk> .
this <unk> came across to the older black .
he said , &quot; <unk> , what do you do in the <unk> ? &quot;
the older black man stood on . he looked at the <unk> , and he looked at me , and he said , &quot; i &apos;m about to say that young man , you don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give the goal . &quot;
i came to ted , because i believe that many of you have understood that the moral <unk> of the universe is far <unk> , but it &apos;s the justice <unk> .
that we &apos;re not completely designed than humans , as we don &apos;t have access to human and <unk> .
it &apos;s our entire survival of our survival to survive every single time .
that we have our visions of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity , with humanity , pity and justice .
and in fact , i want to see those of you who look at the same thing , just just say , don &apos;t lose the goal of the eyes . don &apos;t give them .
they &apos;ve seen in this audience , this community , a obvious wish , and i heard to help them and do something .
what can we do ?
<unk> <unk> : well , there are opportunities everywhere .
if you live in california , there &apos;s a <unk> in this spring , where it &apos;s about , in fact , a relationship to business , something from the <unk> <unk> , which is possible in the politics of <unk> .
here , in california , for example , you &apos;re going to be a billion dollars for the next five years , a billion dollars a billion dollars .
and yet , <unk> percent of all of the <unk> are not with a <unk> .
58 percent of all the <unk> are not <unk> .
this is the chance to do something .
this <unk> is going to describe the money to invest the money in more <unk> and security .
i think there are ways everywhere .
and over the last three decades , the <unk> <unk> in america &apos;s <unk> .
this fact is going to be <unk> in a relationship with <unk> <unk> .
what would you tell somebody who believe that ?
now , in fact , the number of <unk> doesn &apos;t change very much .
most of the <unk> in this country didn &apos;t actually found in the class of <unk> .
it was the <unk> <unk> against drugs .
that &apos;s where the extraordinary amount of numbers are going to be <unk> .
we have <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> .
now , we &apos;ve got the <unk> <unk> that people are going to bring people out of water , for a <unk> , for the <unk> <unk> , for the <unk> <unk> , rather than that you &apos;re <unk> to make things the <unk> .
i think we need to do more , to help people make the victims of a <unk> , not less .
and i believe that our world is not going to help us .
i think that &apos;s what we need to change .
<unk> , you &apos;ve really got a factor here .
they &apos;re a healthy personality .
thank you for ted , thank you . thank you .
in fact , my death is going to be a <unk> <unk> .
so 2 : famine in somalia . a three : <unk> the police .
four : <unk> <unk> . a five : dangerous <unk> .
so six : social <unk> . seven : 65 : 65 deaths .
eight : <unk> . <unk> .
a lot of <unk> : <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> . <unk> . <unk> . egypt . syria .
<unk> . death . disaster .
oh my god .
so this is just a few of the day that i &apos;ve taken over the last six months -- but it &apos;s also got to be the last six days , or the last six years .
the fact is that the media may prefer to show us negative issues because our mind is going to be able to get out of these issues attention .
and there &apos;s also a very good reason for this .
every second every day every day , our senses is going to be a lot more information than our brain can ever do .
and because we &apos;re not more important than our survival , the first <unk> for all the information is a part of our <unk> , the <unk> .
so the <unk> is our <unk> , our <unk> , our <unk> .
it <unk> and <unk> the entire information on the search for all of the <unk> of danger in our own environment .
so if we look at the news , we prefer to look for negative news .
and the old statement , &quot; if it <unk> , the demand is very true .
now , with all of our digital devices that seven days ago , the week , 24 hours a day on the day all this negative news , it &apos;s not a miracle that we are .
it &apos;s not a miracle that everybody thinks that the world is always bad .
but maybe this is not the case .
maybe it &apos;s true .
maybe the enormous progress that we &apos;ve done in the last century through a series of forces that we &apos;ve done in the last few years is so strong that it will be possible in the next three decades , to create a world of organic .
well , i don &apos;t say that we don &apos;t have big problems -- climate change , <unk> , water and <unk> -- that we already have .
and as humans , we are much better at the same thing that we &apos;re doing for a very long view , but they &apos;re looking at it .
now let &apos;s see what we &apos;ve done in the last century , so we can use the development of us .
in the last hundred years , the average lifespan has more than doubled in the last hundred years , which is <unk> in the <unk> of the world &apos;s population .
billions of education has been <unk> by a <unk> .
and it comes out that the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s used to be <unk> .
steve pinker has shown us that we &apos;re now living in a very new time of <unk> life .
and according to charles <unk> is the <unk> <unk> in the past 130 years of 25 percent .
we live in a really extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we increase our expectations all around .
in fact , we &apos;ve done poverty .
remember that a big fraction of the americans are living under the quality of poverty , access to electricity , water , toilets , tv , tv , tv , circles and cars .
the richest of the last century , the <unk> of the earth , would never have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
so the foundation for many of these forms are technologies , and these grow <unk> .
my good friend , ray kurzweil has shown us that every tool that &apos;s going to be on information , on the curve of moore &apos;s law &apos;s law , and the <unk> are all 12 to 24 months .
that &apos;s the mobile phone in their pocket about a million times less than a million times less than a <unk> of the &apos; 70s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore &apos;s law of the last hundred years .
notice two things on this curve .
first of all , how <unk> it is -- in good times like in bad times , war or peace , the recession , recession , depression and <unk> .
this is the result of faster computers that make more complex computers .
it &apos;s <unk> for none of our big problems .
in fact , despite their <unk> <unk> on the left , it &apos;s going on the left .
so , the growth of itself changes .
and on this curve , on the back of moore &apos;s law , we find a series of extraordinary technologies that are available all of us .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; something that my friends with <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; <unk> , sensors and networks , robots that allow personal production on our planet , synthetic biology , <unk> and food , digital medicine , <unk> and artificial intelligence .
how many of you have <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> watson in &quot; risk &quot; risk ?
that was <unk> .
i &apos;ve got the newspapers <unk> , and after the best headlines that i could find .
i love this : &quot; watson <unk> human . &quot;
&quot; risk &quot; is not a simple game .
it &apos;s about to understand the <unk> of language .
so imagine that this artificial intelligence was used to be used by the <unk> of a <unk> .
four years ago , ray <unk> was ray <unk> , and i &apos;m here at ted a new university called <unk> university .
we bring our students all of these technologies , with <unk> focus on how these are used to be used to solve the big challenges of humanity .
and every year , we ask the students , businesses , products and services to create the lives in a decade , the life of billions of people .
think about that a group of students today that can change the life of billions of people today .
30 years ago , it had been ridiculous .
today , we can call the <unk> of companies that have done exactly this .
now , when i think we &apos;re going to create flu , i don &apos;t mean a life full of luxury for everyone on this planet ; it &apos;s about to create a life full of possibilities .
it &apos;s about to create from a half of goods .
in fact , it &apos;s <unk> , and technology is a resource <unk> force .
here &apos;s an example .
this is the story of <unk> <unk> in the middle of the 18th century .
he &apos;s the guy left .
he invited the king of <unk> to dinner .
<unk> soldiers took <unk> , <unk> himself had been <unk> .
the king of <unk> , but was <unk> .
in fact , in this time , the most fundamental metal on the planet , worse than gold and <unk> .
this is the reason that the activity of the <unk> was made of <unk> .
even though , <unk> percent of the <unk> , it doesn &apos;t take it as a <unk> metal .
it &apos;s going to be connected by oxygen and <unk> .
but then the technology was developed , and we made <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s how we use it with our <unk> .
so let &apos;s take this analogy to the future .
we think about <unk> .
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet that &apos;s filled with <unk> more energy than we use a year .
and in fact , <unk> of energy <unk> is all <unk> minutes on the surface of the surface .
it &apos;s not about <unk> , the problem is smell .
and there are good news .
in this year , you &apos;ve done it for the first time to reduce the cost of <unk> in india to 50 percent of the <unk> -- <unk> rupees to 17 rupees .
the cost of solar , in the last year , has been 50 percent .
at the end of month , this was published with a study , which shows that until the end of this decade in the <unk> areas of the united states of the united states of the united states , in the <unk> , is going to cost about 15 cents in the national average .
and if we have a <unk> , then we &apos;re going to have the water , we &apos;re going to have <unk> water .
let &apos;s talk about <unk> .
do you remember , when carl <unk> was the <unk> of 1990 , when it was in saturn , back to earth ?
he took a famous photograph . how did it mean ?
&quot; a <unk> blue . &quot;
because we live on a <unk> life .
we live on a planet , which is to 70 percent with water .
yes , it &apos;s <unk> percent , two percent are <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be <unk> percent of the water on the planet , but there &apos;s also hope .
and there are new technologies , not in 10 or 20 years , but now .
it &apos;s new <unk> on the way , <unk> .
and from a conversation today with dean <unk> , one of the movies that i want to share with you , i want to share with you -- he &apos;d like to share with you -- he gave me permission -- his <unk> , the <unk> , and that many of you may have heard of . it &apos;s the size of a <unk> in the <unk> .
it can produce a thousand gallons of clean drinking water per day -- whether <unk> , <unk> water -- and all of that for less than two cents per gallon .
the army of coca-cola has just <unk> , a big <unk> with a hundred units in developing countries .
and if all right , i &apos;m very excited , and i &apos;m very confident , then coca-cola , this technology is going to use global growth in <unk> countries on the entire planet .
this is <unk> innovation that there are today .
and we &apos;ve seen this with mobile phones .
so my goodness , we &apos;re going to go to the 70 percent of the <unk> of mobile phones in developing countries to the end of <unk> .
just think that a <unk> <unk> with a mobile phone in the middle of kenya , in the middle of kenya , was a better <unk> than president school had 25 years ago .
and if you look at your smartphone on google , they have more access to knowledge and information as president clinton had 15 years ago .
they live in a world , which is information and communications , as no one has ever been able to make predictions .
and it &apos;s still better , the things that you &apos;re going to have spent several thousand dollars -- gps , <unk> and photograph , libraries of books and music , technology to medical <unk> -- are actually literally <unk> and cheaper in your mobile phone .
and the best thing about that is maybe what we expect in health care .
last month , i had the pleasure , with the <unk> , which is called &quot; dollars 10 million <unk> <unk> x prize &apos;s prize . &quot;
we &apos;re using teams on the entire world , to connect all these technologies together in a mobile phone that you can talk to the device that you can talk to the device , because it &apos;s going to test <unk> or your <unk> .
and to win , the device needs to be a better diagnosis than a team of <unk> doctors .
imagine this device . in the middle of a developing country , where there is no doctors , but 25 percent of the <unk> and 1.3 percent of the apartments of health care .
if this device is a <unk> or <unk> <unk> , which is not known , it &apos;s called the <unk> , and it &apos;s <unk> a pandemic from her <unk> .
but now , in the biggest force that we &apos;re going to have to be a world of <unk> .
i call them &quot; the next billion . &quot;
the white lines are for the population .
we only have the <unk> .
and just by the way , the biggest <unk> against a growth is a better education and diet in the entire world .
so , in two billion people , we &apos;ve been involved in the two billion people online .
after 2020 , we &apos;re <unk> from two to five billion <unk> .
three billion new minds , which we never heard before have heard of global communication .
what do these people need ?
what are they going to consume ? what are you going to support ?
and instead of the <unk> , i see one of the biggest economic <unk> of history .
these people represent multiple <unk> dollars that are growing in the global economy .
and they &apos;re going to be healthier by the use of the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be able to be able to go through the <unk> , and that they &apos;re going to have the opportunity to use 3d light and the <unk> of nature , and so much more complicated than ever before .
so what can we do about three billion infrastructure , healthy , productive members of the <unk> of the <unk> ?
how would it be with a sentence of new , never before <unk> voices .
how would it be like this , the constitution , wherever they are to give a voice to make a voice to make attention and change change , for the first time ?
what are these three billion people ?
how would it be with <unk> that we can &apos;t even predict ?
one of the things that i learned through the x prize is that little teams that i &apos;ve learned through passion and focus , extraordinary things can create , things that have big companies and governments only could do in the past .
i want to finish with a story that was really excited to me .
there &apos;s a program that may have already already already know .
it &apos;s a game that &apos;s called <unk> .
it was designed at the university of washington in seattle .
and it &apos;s a game where people can take a sequence of acids to explore how the protein is going to develop .
so , after his behavior , we can make the structure and function .
and this is very important in the <unk> .
there was a problem for <unk> .
and this game was taken from 2001 and i played .
and there are hundreds of thousands of thousands of people who played the game online .
and it showed that today , the human pattern is better the proteins as the best <unk> .
and when these people came and looked at who the best <unk> of the world was , this is not a <unk> , but it was not an <unk> , it was somebody from england , jason , a woman who was working in a <unk> , and at night , the best <unk> of the world was in the world .
ladies and gentlemen , which i have enormous trust in our future is the fact that we have more power today than individuals to ask us the big challenges of our planet .
we have access to tools with enormous technology .
we &apos;ve got the passion of a <unk> .
we have the capital of <unk> .
and we &apos;ve got three billion new minds with which we can work online to make the new challenges , and to do that , to do what needs to do .
we expect a few extraordinary decades .
thank you .
i believe that we have to have something against a <unk> piece of medical culture .
and i think it starts with a student , and i am .
and maybe i &apos;m interested in the business of a long time , as i can allow me to make a piece of my own wrong <unk> to make this .
but before i come to the real theme of my talk , let &apos;s start with a little baseball .
hey , why not ?
we &apos;re at the <unk> near , and we &apos;re moving to the <unk> .
we all love baseball , right ?
baseball is full of an amazing statistics .
and there are hundreds of them .
&quot; <unk> &quot; is soon , and it &apos;s about statistics and to use this to use a great baseball team .
i &apos;m going to give me an statistics of the things that i hope most of you already heard about .
it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> .
we talk about a $ 300 , if a <unk> <unk> .
and that means that the player is certainly three of 10 <unk> .
this is called the ball on the <unk> , he &apos;s going to go down , he &apos;s not going to come down , and who tries to end up the ball for the first spectrum , it doesn &apos;t have been done in time , and it was in security .
three of 11 .
do you know how to put a <unk> in <unk> baseball ?
well , really good , maybe a <unk> .
do you know how to call a <unk> ?
that &apos;s somebody in the rest of the rest of the rest of 10 .
<unk> -- like ted williams <unk> -- the last <unk> <unk> of baseball players who met the <unk> of a <unk> .
let &apos;s go back to my world &apos;s world of medicine , where i feel about a little bit better , or maybe a little less likely that i &apos;ve talked to you about this .
now , they have a <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> , which is <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work , right ?
so , they &apos;re living in a certain remote area , and they &apos;ve got a beloved people with <unk> <unk> and their <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> this to a <unk> , which is <unk> in <unk> .
but , but you know what ?
it &apos;s much better . it &apos;s on the <unk> state .
and they <unk> a <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t work .
but i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
what do you believe like the <unk> for a <unk> or a nurse or a nurse or a <unk> , a <unk> , a <unk> .
great , very good .
the truth is that no one in the entire medicine knows what a good surgeon or a doctor or a doctor should be .
but what we &apos;re doing is that we &apos;ve got every one of you , including me , in the world with the way to be perfect .
never to do a mistake , no one doesn &apos;t make sense of the details of how this is going to be supposed to be done .
and this is the message that i took in school .
i was a <unk> <unk> student .
in high school , a <unk> was told that brian <unk> was going to learn that brian <unk> for a <unk> .
and that &apos;s how it was .
and i learned in my little <unk> <unk> in the summer , in the <unk> national hospital , <unk> from here .
i learned everything .
in my <unk> , i learned the origins and tail every <unk> , every stick of one of them , which is <unk> by the <unk> <unk> , <unk> and ordinary <unk> .
i even knew the <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s the same time i was doing more and more .
and i was good , i was <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
and i left the university with the impression that i knew if i knew anything , and everything knew , or at least so much as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible , that i &apos;m going to be <unk> against it .
and it worked for a time for a time , until i met my wife .
i <unk> on a <unk> here in toronto , as a woman in toronto , to me in the <unk> of the hospital .
at this time , i was the <unk> layer in the <unk> service .
and it was my mission , as the <unk> <unk> advice to study the <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give up the same thing to my <unk> .
i photographed woman camera , and she was in <unk> .
and when i put them through it , they made <unk> sounds .
and when i put her chest with the <unk> <unk> , i could hear a <unk> sound on both sides , who told me that she was <unk> .
this is a state in which the heart has failed , instead of <unk> the entire blood , it &apos;s part of the sand in the lung , and they <unk> this , therefore , the <unk> .
and that was not hard to <unk> .
i asked them , and i made myself the treatment of treatment .
i had her <unk> . i had their medicine to take the pressure of the heart .
i gave her medicine that we call <unk> , water <unk> , so that they <unk> the liquid .
and over one time , after a half and two hours , they began to feel better .
i felt really good .
and i made my first mistake , i sent her home .
in fact , i did two mistakes .
i sent her home without talking to my <unk> .
i didn &apos;t put it up and did what i should have had a call in my <unk> <unk> to him with him <unk> , so he would have had a chance to do a own image .
and he knew it would be able to be able to get additional information to her <unk> .
maybe i did it with a good reason .
maybe i didn &apos;t want to be the <unk> doctor .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take his responsibility that i was so , and so i would be able to worry to my patient without making it .
my second mistake was worse .
that &apos;s where i sent her home , i <unk> a quiet voice in me trying to tell me , &quot; <unk> , no good idea . i don &apos;t do it . &quot;
and in fact , i was so very much about that i asked the nurse that i asked the nurse , which is going to come back to the wife , &quot; do you think it &apos;s okay when you go home ? &quot;
and the nurse thought about it , and he said in <unk> , &quot; yeah , i think it &apos;s going to go good . &quot;
i remember that when it had been yesterday .
so i <unk> the <unk> and a <unk> and <unk> , and they brought them home .
and i went back to work .
the rest day , the night , i had this <unk> feeling in my stomach .
but i was working on .
and at the end of the day , i took my stuff , <unk> the hospital , and i went to go to a dollar to go back to the car , when i did something that i didn &apos;t do .
i went through the <unk> on my way home .
and there said a different nurse , not the sister who had seen for woman , but one other three words to me , and these three words , most of the <unk> i know .
other doctors fear this as well , but the <unk> is very special because we &apos;re going to see the patient &apos;s <unk> .
these three words , do you remember ?
&quot; remember the patient , you know , would you put it home ? &quot;
asked the nurse .
&quot; so she &apos;s back , &quot; she said , &quot; she said in this particular <unk> .
so she was back .
she was back and die .
about a hour after that she was coming back home , after i got her home , and the family <unk> , and the family <unk> , they brought them back to the <unk> with a blood pressure of 50 , which is a dangerous <unk> .
they never breathe , and it was blue <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> was all the other strands .
they gave her <unk> .
she <unk> them to the <unk> .
i was shocked , and to go to the inner <unk> .
and i grew up with this <unk> , because she came up to the <unk> , and i realized that they were going to recover .
and after two , three days ago , she was clear that they never would go back .
she didn &apos;t have a <unk> <unk> .
their family went out .
and in the course of eight or nine days , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
at the <unk> day , they go to her -- woman printer , a woman , a woman , a mom and grandmother .
you tell you that you never forget the names of the <unk> .
and that was the first time i found this .
the next couple of weeks i did me , and i learned the first time to be <unk> , and i learned to be isolated , <unk> , not the kind of healthy shame that you &apos;re thinking , because you don &apos;t have to talk to the colleagues about that , because you don &apos;t have to talk to the colleagues about that .
you all know the healthy shame , if you have a secret of the best friend of the best friend , even though this one is going to be <unk> , and you &apos;re going to be able to get the best friend , if one of the most bad example , if one on the end of the most bad thing , you &apos;re going to be able to do it again .
if you &apos;re making <unk> , and you never do it again .
this is the kind of <unk> shame .
i &apos;m talking about <unk> that i &apos;m talking about , is that one of the things that &apos;s going to do .
it &apos;s the one who says , it &apos;s not what you &apos;ve done is bad , but it &apos;s bad .
and that was what i felt .
and it wasn &apos;t at the bottom of my <unk> , he was very <unk> .
he talked to the family , and i &apos;m sure that he was <unk> , and i &apos;m sure that he was not going to be <unk> .
but i asked myself to ask these questions .
why didn &apos;t i ask the <unk> ? why do i call them home ?
and then in my worst moments , how could i make a bad mistake ?
why am i going to go to medicine ?
and nonetheless , it &apos;s safe to get it .
i began to feel better .
and then , in a <unk> day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , and i said maybe i can feel better .
and i was thinking that if i had my efforts to justice , and i never had a mistake , and i never got a mistake that the voice might be <unk> .
and they did it .
and i was working on .
and then it happened again .
two years later , i had service in the <unk> hospital in a <unk> hospital north of toronto , and i <unk> a 25 years old man with <unk> <unk> .
it was a lot of work , and i &apos;m in a wave .
he always showed here .
i looked at the <unk> , and it was a little bit of pink .
and i gave him a laptop for innovation and sent him out .
and once he went out of the door , he showed him on his <unk> .
two days later , i came to my next <unk> , and my <unk> asked me to give me a conversation in her office .
and she said that three words : remember ?
&quot; do you remind you about the patient &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
it turns out he was a <unk> .
he had a <unk> disease called <unk> .
you can see that , but it &apos;s not <unk> , but it &apos;s not <unk> , and the upper <unk> , and that is the <unk> of the <unk> .
and fortunately , he didn &apos;t die .
he got <unk> <unk> , and there was a couple of days later .
and i went back through the same <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and i felt <unk> , and i went back to the work , and i was going to go back to the work , and that &apos;s what happened .
in a <unk> , i have two times a <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s already a lot of time , especially if you think that you &apos;re working in a hospital , that &apos;s just 14 patients per night .
in two cases , i didn &apos;t read her home , and there was no <unk> in their treatment .
i thought he had been <unk> .
i <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> . when it was without <unk> , my colleague , at the <unk> of the patient &apos;s <unk> of the patient , and he called the <unk> .
the other had strong diarrhea .
i <unk> <unk> to <unk> him , and i asked my colleagues as well .
and that &apos;s what he did , and when he was a <unk> in the right islands , he said , he called the <unk> .
in both cases , <unk> , and it was good .
both cases <unk> to me , <unk> me .
and i &apos;d be happy to tell you that my worst mistake was just in the first five years , which happened to be a lot of my colleagues , but it &apos;s a <unk> .
some of my <unk> happened in the last five years .
it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> and without support .
here &apos;s the problem : if i don &apos;t end with my mistakes and talk about it , if i can tell the quiet voice , which is what really happened to me , how can i do it with my colleague ?
how can i teach you my mistakes so they don &apos;t invest the same ?
if i was in a room -- like now , i don &apos;t know what you &apos;re thinking about .
when did you heard the last time of someone who was talking about <unk> about <unk> <unk> ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party , and there may be someone else to hear about any other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody about their own mistakes .
if i was in a room with colleagues , and i would ask you to tell her <unk> , and to tell you what i &apos;d like to tell you , i would not get to the end of the second story before it was really proud of somebody else , you would be able to change the subject and forget the rest of the rest .
and in fact , if i know , or my colleagues know that a <unk> <unk> in my hospital would have told me the wrong leg , you know , i had a lot of problems to look at him in the eyes .
that &apos;s the system we live .
it &apos;s a completely <unk> of mistakes .
it &apos;s a system in which there are two fundamental sites -- those who make mistakes , and those who don &apos;t do . the ones that are <unk> , and they don &apos;t have the <unk> , which is <unk> with bad results , and that &apos;s the good results .
it &apos;s almost a <unk> reaction like antibodies that have a people .
and there &apos;s the idea that if we have the people who make mistakes that make the mistakes out of medicine , that we &apos;re going to get a <unk> system .
but there are two problems .
in my about 20 years of the medical <unk> and journalism , i &apos;ve got a personal medical study about medical errors and false treatments to be able to be able to give you my first article to my show in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black type of , &quot; he wrote to learn .
and what i learned is that mistakes are absolutely <unk> .
we &apos;re working in a system in which every day , in which one of 10 <unk> is either a wrong thing , or wrong , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , and they &apos;re always <unk> , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> or dead or dead .
in this state , about <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> .
in the united states , the institute of medicine is about 100,000 dollars .
both are strong <unk> , because we don &apos;t look at the problem as well as we should .
and it &apos;s the <unk> .
in the <unk> of the medical world , all two to three years ago , we &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
<unk> is ubiquitous .
we can &apos;t get rid of it .
we have a cognitive mistake , so that we can take a perfect <unk> for a patient .
and then i take the same patient with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , and i &apos;m going to give you a slightly <unk> breath , and suddenly , the story is <unk> with sputnik .
i don &apos;t take the same .
i &apos;m not a robot ; i don &apos;t always do things .
and my patient are not cars ; they &apos;re not going to tell me their symptoms in the same way .
all of these things are <unk> .
so if you take the system as well as i was talking about it , and all the <unk> <unk> <unk> , then there &apos;s no longer left .
and you know the <unk> of people who don &apos;t want to talk about their worst cases ?
in my show , &quot; white <unk> , black . &quot; i &apos;d like to say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i would say , &quot; this is my worst mistake , &quot; i said , &quot; well , what i &apos;m going to show with him ? &quot; and then i &apos;m going to show the microphone with him .
and then they &apos;re going to get their <unk> , they &apos;re looking at the head , and then you look down , it &apos;s hard to tell their stories , and they &apos;re going to start to tell their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to say to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t do the same errors that i <unk> . &quot;
what you need is an environment that you &apos;re able to do in the way .
what you need is a new medical culture .
and it starts with a doctor .
the new <unk> doctor is a man who knows his humanity , they &apos;re not proud of the mistakes , but it &apos;s not proud of them to learn about them to learn that it can be going to be <unk> .
they <unk> their experience with others .
they &apos;re trying to talk to the other of their mistakes .
and it shows other other of their mistakes , not about <unk> , but in a <unk> , <unk> way that all of them benefit .
and they &apos;re working in a medical culture , which is that people can put the system with life and if this is so , then people are going to do a little bit of time .
so that the system is designed to create <unk> , which is that it &apos;s easier to create errors that make people <unk> , and it also allows people to make the potential errors , and it &apos;s also <unk> , and that , especially for people like me to make the mistakes , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to do for people like me to make the mistakes of this .
my name is brian <unk> .
i &apos;m the new <unk> doctor .
i &apos;m a human . i &apos;m doing mistakes .
but i &apos;m <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m trying to learn best to learn about it , to get it different .
i don &apos;t know what you think about me , but i can live with life .
let me look at three of my own words : i remember .
i &apos;m going to talk about a tiny , little idea .
it &apos;s about <unk> <unk> .
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i &apos;m going to tell you three stories about three stories to use time .
the first story is from charles darwin , one of my heroes .
you probably know that he was <unk> here .
and you like to think that it &apos;s <unk> , but that &apos;s not true .
it was a fish .
he described one of them as a very <unk> .
it was a <unk> .
and in the &apos; 80s , he was <unk> in a big dimension .
so , it &apos;s on the red list .
this story , we &apos;ve heard many times from the 1990s or from other places , it &apos;s not very special .
yet , we &apos;re still going to go back to the galapagos .
we &apos;re still thinking , they &apos;re looked at it .
and the <unk> <unk> , they always describe them .
what &apos;s happening here ?
the second story is going to be another concept called <unk> <unk> .
because i &apos;ve seen it when i was in rwanda , i was talking about <unk> .
i went there , because i grew up in europe , and i wanted to work later in africa .
i thought i could change myself .
and i got a bad <unk> , and i was convinced that i really didn &apos;t think of it there .
it was my first <unk> .
as you can see , the <unk> of <unk> and from a couple of <unk> <unk> .
there was <unk> from about 20 centimeters , <unk> , a <unk> of the <unk> .
the <unk> of these <unk> were very <unk> , and the <unk> were going to be good about it , and it was working in ghana .
when i got 27 years later , the fish came down to half the size of his size .
<unk> <unk> , they <unk> five centimeters .
they were genetically <unk> .
it was still fish .
people were still happy .
and the fish also had the happiness to be there .
so it doesn &apos;t change anything , and yet it changes everything .
my third little story , i told about my <unk> at the <unk> of the <unk> in asia .
in the &apos; 70s -- rather at the beginning of the 1960s -- <unk> europe are many <unk> .
in fact , in fact , countries who started about 100 different fish , the industrial <unk> , this pretty ugly ship called <unk> .
i went on with this , and we &apos;ve done all over the south coast of <unk> ocean and especially in the <unk> .
we didn &apos;t have words for what we did .
i know that it was the bottom of the sea .
so , 95 percent of our <unk> were <unk> , other animals that are connected to the reason .
the biggest part of the fish , the little dots here on the <unk> , the <unk> , were <unk> .
and basically , the bottom of the ocean comes out of the sea , and then it was <unk> .
these images are extraordinary , because the transition is very quick .
in a year of a year , you &apos;re going to start with a conversation , and then it starts with the <unk> .
the reason is changing . from -- in this case -- a hard reason or <unk> corals is <unk> .
this is a dead <unk> .
they weren &apos;t eaten , they didn &apos;t get it out because they were dead .
then we started a life .
it wasn &apos;t <unk> .
then they wanted to kill them , because you could eat it good .
in fact , this mountain is going to <unk> every time of <unk> , when they go into areas where they were never <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to go .
we change the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
we &apos;re called our <unk> of the new level of the new level , and we don &apos;t call ourselves what was there .
if you put it down , this is what happens .
in the world , a couple of good things : biodiversity , number of <unk> , the green of their country , the green of their country , the <unk> .
in the time , it &apos;s changing . it changes , because of the people , they are all the same , of course , of course .
every generation comes out the images that they &apos;re going to be in the beginning of their conscious life , as a result , and it becomes all of it .
so the difference is going to be seen as loss .
but you don &apos;t take the people out there .
it can give a vision of change .
and at the end of the end , it &apos;s only going to get the <unk> .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now is our goal .
we want to get things that are disappeared , or things that are not so much more like they were .
now , you might think that the problem of people who lived when they lived in <unk> societies , animals were killed , and that only after a couple of generations was aware of what they had done .
because obviously , one animal is going to be very often even rare before it was rare before it <unk> .
so , you don &apos;t lose <unk> animals .
you &apos;re still able to lose rare animals .
and that &apos;s why it &apos;s not going to be a big loss .
with time , we &apos;re going to focus on the big animals and in the ocean , the big fish .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> because we &apos;re going to start .
at the time , there &apos;s little fish left , and we think this is the <unk> .
the question is , why people accept that .
well , because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
of course , many people , scientists , mathematicians , told that it was really different .
they &apos;re going to mention it , because the evidence that you &apos;re in a early form is not like the evidence that you would like to describe the evidence .
so , for example , there &apos;s the <unk> that the report of a <unk> myth that can &apos;t be used in this area that can &apos;t be used to be used in this area , or it doesn &apos;t usually be <unk> , because it &apos;s not &quot; science . &quot;
so we &apos;ve got the situation that people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in <unk> societies , because they don &apos;t know the sources of the past .
this shows the enormous big role that can play a <unk> .
because through <unk> , we &apos;re basically looking at the past .
we ask the past time that people can &apos;t understand , because that &apos;s changing the <unk> and very low .
so these are the people who are going to see a <unk> , and that &apos;s the way that it allows you to get their <unk> .
what about the people who don &apos;t do that , because they don &apos;t have access to have access -- the people in the middle of the middle of the west ?
here , i think the art , and the film might put the gap , and the film might be able to put the gap .
this is the simulation of <unk> bay .
six years ago , there was <unk> -- 500 years ago .
and the <unk> and <unk> , you might remind you about the <unk> .
if you think about the <unk> , if you think about why people were so <unk> -- except by the <unk> , why were they <unk> ?
because it &apos;s kind of <unk> that it was going to be lost in a certain way .
so my point is , the only thing i &apos;m going to give you is that he &apos;s going to be able to tell you that he &apos;s called &quot; <unk> ii &quot; under water .
thank you .
in the 80s , in the 1960s , in the <unk> , you had to be , if you had a mall , this is the government .
they also had to get a sheet with <unk> from this mall .
so the reason for this : the government could be able to go out where a text came from .
and finally , she took a article with <unk> <unk> , and they were able to discover the <unk> of this thought .
and we couldn &apos;t understand in the west , as somebody else could do something like something like that , and how much that it would be .
in our own countries , we would never do something like that .
but if you put a new <unk> in the year of california , and a page , then this is the site , then this site has <unk> yellow <unk> on every side , in a pattern , in a pattern , which is clear the side of them and <unk> their printer .
that &apos;s what happens today .
and it doesn &apos;t seem to be <unk> .
and this was an example of what our own governments are doing the technology against us , the citizens , we use .
and this is one of the three <unk> from the world today .
let &apos;s look at what really happens on the world : we can see the attacks in categories .
we &apos;ve got three <unk> .
there are <unk> .
for example , this is mr. <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
and the <unk> of <unk> are very easy to understand .
these people deserve money .
they use <unk> to earn a lot of money , a huge amount of money .
there are thousands of <unk> cases of <unk> , <unk> that their money through gender .
this is <unk> <unk> from <unk> in toronto .
this is ford <unk> .
julian watts .
<unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> anderson , <unk> <unk> and so forth and so forth .
these people are going online to the wealth , but they have been illegal because they &apos;ve been used to be <unk> by <unk> , and we &apos;ve been able to use our <unk> , or also <unk> that our <unk> , or also <unk> that our <unk> <unk> on the <unk> of the keyboard , while we &apos;re going online to a half of the computer .
the u.s. intelligence <unk> , two months ago , the swiss <unk> of mr. kelly here was one , and on this <unk> was <unk> million dollars when it was <unk> .
mr. <unk> himself is on the <unk> foot , the <unk> is unknown .
and i think it &apos;s more likely to be more likely that we &apos;re going to be victims of a <unk> , as an <unk> in the real world .
and it &apos;s very obvious that this is just worse to be worse .
in the future , most crime is going to play online .
the second <unk> that we can see today is not <unk> by money .
they &apos;re <unk> by something else -- <unk> , a opinion , or through your audience .
groups like anonymous are <unk> over the last 12 months , and they have become one of the <unk> on the field of <unk> .
so these are the three <unk> : <unk> , which is the money that we &apos;re going to do with resistance , <unk> like anonymous , but the last group are nations , governments who are <unk> .
this is what we &apos;ve been , like , like <unk> .
it turns out what happens when governments do their own citizens .
<unk> is a <unk> from the netherlands -- or it was that .
in the last night , it had to be <unk> , because <unk> was <unk> .
somebody was <unk> , and he had been <unk> the system .
and last week in a meeting with the dutch <unk> , i asked one of the people who have the question , whether it &apos;s possible for possible , that because of the <unk> people died .
and his answer was , &quot; yes . &quot;
well , how are people living in the game of one ?
<unk> is a <unk> .
they sell <unk> .
what do you do with <unk> ?
now , a <unk> needs to be , if you put a website with <unk> , with <unk> service , for example .
now , we &apos;re going to use all of us , or many of us , <unk> or one of their lips , but these services are especially <unk> in <unk> states like the iran where <unk> <unk> <unk> , and they know that they can make more trust as local <unk> , and that they can &apos;t get the local government , so that the local government can &apos;t <unk> in their meetings .
but if you see it in a foreign community .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s what happens in the case of <unk> .
how do it happen to the arab spring and things that happens for example in egypt ?
well , in egypt , in egypt , in april , the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and then they found a lot of evidence .
and this is what a <unk> was called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and in this <unk> , the notes of one in germany had sold a couple of programs that had been sold by the <unk> government , which they were -- in very large scale -- in a very large scale -- for all of the communication .
they had had this program for <unk> euros to the <unk> government .
the <unk> is right here .
so western governments are <unk> governments with <unk> , so they can do that against their own citizens .
but western governments are helping themselves .
for example , in germany only a couple of weeks ago , a couple of weeks ago , the so-called <unk> , which was a <unk> , which was used by <unk> <unk> to <unk> their own citizens .
if you &apos;re going to be <unk> in a <unk> , you &apos;re going to <unk> your telephone .
but today we are far beyond that .
they <unk> their internet .
they use resources like the <unk> , to <unk> their computer with a <unk> <unk> , which allows them to <unk> their entire communication , their <unk> <unk> , their <unk> <unk> .
so if we think about these things , it would be the obvious answer of people : &quot; ok , that sounds bad , but it &apos;s not because i &apos;m a <unk> citizen .
i don &apos;t have to worry about me .
i have nothing to hide . &quot;
and this argument doesn &apos;t make sense .
seven needs to be given .
<unk> is not the debate .
it &apos;s not a decision between privacy and security .
it &apos;s a decision between freedom and control .
and as we today , in the year of 2011 , our governments like to trust our governments , but it &apos;s all right that we &apos;re going to do for us .
and trust , we don &apos;t trust any future government , a government that we might have in 50 years ?
these are the questions that we have to do with the next 50 years .
it may seem strange , but i &apos;m a big fan of <unk> .
the first <unk> was created <unk> , and <unk> , a simple idea : <unk> from <unk> with the way that we &apos;re doing .
<unk> were very quickly the <unk> <unk> in the world .
they were able to build things that were bigger than we have , building the bridges , the bridges , a rock after the other .
in fact , the <unk> was used to be the building of our time .
so a hundred years later , in bosnia , lego came out of this .
it was called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
and in less years , they took sex in every household .
it &apos;s going to be driven by 400 billion rocks -- or 75 rocks for every person on this planet .
they don &apos;t have to be an engineer to create beautiful houses , beautiful bridges or beautiful building .
they were able to do it for all possible .
<unk> has essentially the <unk> , the building of the world , and that &apos;s a building of the world , and it made a building for our imagination .
in the meantime , in the same year at bell , the next year , the next century , the next revolution , the next building .
the transistor was a little <unk> , which was to give us from a world of <unk> , <unk> losses to a world in which everything was going to be able to do .
like the <unk> , allows us to build a lot more , more complex to build more efficient , a rock after the other .
but there &apos;s a <unk> : the transistor was only for experts .
i mean , i don &apos;t accept that the building of our time for experts , and so i decided to change it .
so eight years ago , i was at the media lab , and i started to explore this idea of how to make the power of the engineers in the hand of artists and designers .
a few years ago , i began to develop <unk> .
let me show you how they work .
<unk> are electronic <unk> that have a specific function .
they &apos;re <unk> , light , clay , motor and sensor .
and the best thing about this is that they &apos;re connected to <unk> together .
so you can &apos;t put it wrong around .
rocks are <unk> .
green is a copy , blue is electricity , pink is <unk> and orange .
now , what you need to do is make a blue and a green , and you can connect with a green , and you can build it very quickly .
they put a blue on a green , and they can do light .
you can put a bubble in between the <unk> and so they have a little <unk> .
take the <unk> out of a <unk> , which is here , <unk> , and they &apos;ve done a little <unk> .
let &apos;s put this <unk> for a additional effect , and they &apos;ve created a <unk> .
i &apos;m going to stop .
so , the simple play , it &apos;s actually a very powerful thing .
instead of that , you have to test , <unk> or <unk> , allows you to express them with simple , efficient gestures .
so to open up the <unk> or slow , it &apos;s just going to go down to this button , and it makes it faster , and it makes it faster or slower .
the idea behind <unk> is that it &apos;s a growing library .
we want to bring every single interaction on this world in a <unk> rock .
risks , sounds , <unk> , motors -- everything should be available .
we have <unk> <unk> to children , and you can see them playing with it .
and it was an incredible experience .
the most important is how they start to understand the electronics that they &apos;re in the everyday , and they don &apos;t learn to learn in school .
so , for example , a <unk> is working , or why the doors of the <unk> <unk> , or how a ipod goes to touch .
we &apos;ve also been able to get <unk> .
so , for example , we had no experience with no experience in electronic things that began to play with <unk> as material .
here we see , with <unk> , paper and water , like <unk> ...
a couple of weeks ago , we brought <unk> to risd , and we gave them some designers who had no technical experience -- only box , wood and paper -- and they said , &quot; power . &quot;
here &apos;s an example of a project that they made , a <unk> <unk> .
but wait , this is really my <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> from <unk> , the fear in the darkness .
for this <unk> , <unk> , a different material , electronics became just another material .
and we want to do this material for all .
so <unk> is open source .
you can go to the website , all the <unk> , and you can make yourself .
we want the world of <unk> , the inventor , the <unk> , because these world we live , this interactive world we &apos;re thinking about .
so , they &apos;re going to go and start to reinvent them .
thank you .
