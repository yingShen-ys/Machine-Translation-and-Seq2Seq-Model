now , why is that a role of human health ?
here &apos;s a graph of the <unk> of dolphins in the <unk> bay .
and i remember , as i was sitting in my desk , and i thought , &quot; well , i know . what &apos;s a great scientific discovery . &quot; but it was so terrible .
they &apos;re always taken around the world , and more often more than the same reason , and i think that we should use <unk> .
last time , i showed you how strong we have the ecosystem of monterey bay , through pollution , and the <unk> and all kinds of problems .
<unk> -- <unk> -- <unk> .
at the same time , he was asked his mom said , &quot; do you know the book of michael <unk> ? &quot;
we were really afraid .
paul here is the head of the head .
you saw the skeleton .
and we &apos;ve got this ability .
now , our modern way of something that is the benefits , but i think we should see , we should see what price .
clay shirky : this great <unk> of all the <unk> , was the assumption that we &apos;re going to be asked here on the <unk> , in this wonderful way .
today , there are so many new employees that are <unk> and investments that people have together , together for a goal , in a larger context .
and i &apos;m fascinated because it &apos;s not only the lowest thing that we &apos;re doing , but other big parts of the social <unk> , and in the behavior , we &apos;re doing the business of business as <unk> .
i don &apos;t love this photograph on me . it &apos;s in my office , because i &apos;ve always got a <unk> connection to these two men , i never learned to know .
my own research of mobile , and <unk> shows that 80 percent of all the <unk> is actually going to go to four people . 80 percent .
whenever you have a moment of time , you &apos;re <unk> with each other .
and with the modern <unk> , a very <unk> approach , where it was a clear <unk> between the private environment and the public environment .
we &apos;re worried that <unk> , text , facebook of the <unk> difference , but <unk> <unk> research shows how the most <unk> relationships can be able to be able to make love about <unk> as distance and <unk> .
one of the things that we &apos;ve developed in the lab -- we &apos;ve evolved several vehicles -- we &apos;ve evolved several vehicles -- is how we believe , the first mental <unk> of the world .
for example , the <unk> brain is to create a lot of <unk> .
not a new challenge .
at the time , we spend about eight miles a year ago to send a people in jail .
their family lives since eight generations in a city called <unk> , west virginia .
yeah .
we can create these local markets and incentives to create <unk> materials as more than more effective .
and we all should invest in it .
and he said sometimes , you don &apos;t believe it , on a <unk> in los angeles -- one reason to love l.a. -- a reason to love l.a.
i started my company to help communities in the entire country , to help their <unk> potential to improve the entire life of their people .
and before you didn &apos;t have kids , you &apos;re not going to understand what i mean . &quot;
these <unk> people discover in the <unk> of the community &apos;s community .
it takes time all time .
deception is just <unk> by one of the <unk> against a person , and somebody with condoms is not a person . &quot;
in the people , it &apos;s not a long time .
but i found the kids that i &apos;ve been born , and i was born , so i don &apos;t want to imagine that i don &apos;t want to imagine you .
he wouldn &apos;t get his legs right .
i come from a <unk> family . i had a lot of happiness .
it &apos;s about two weeks old . and there they are .
this is at the beginning 2000 . my son , <unk> -- that &apos;s now , many of you already know -- went to cambodia , and that was a half of us built in school , just as she was connected to the internet .
think of it -- because it &apos;s also other people like bill gates , who said , &quot; oh , you &apos;ve got a real computer . &quot;
africa is also pretty rare . let &apos;s look at some languages .
and guess what ? we won .
we &apos;ve got to be able to integrate no additional <unk> to change the prices of the bottom of the bottom .
so for a <unk> , my apartment is about as <unk> as outer space .
and we can make ourselves about the <unk> of <unk> .
so , to talk about a <unk> , so i said , it &apos;s too <unk> , even though i don &apos;t know what &apos;s going to do with it or <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> to people who don &apos;t want to call the <unk> .
in the subject , there &apos;s bigger <unk> .
no one of the most important theories was a full of success .
we &apos;re afraid that the world is looking at .
and as a lot of this work , we found something like this , or i found something that was really fascinated to me , maybe you can remember it .
in fact , it just happened -- from light to darkness in six seconds .
i see their faces very closely .
that &apos;s not a expression of joy .
this lady here has even a particularly <unk> face , and both sides of them are beautiful .
this thing here is this thing here , <unk> light on that , if you move out , it gets a <unk> object , even though it &apos;s <unk> -- just just how brilliant it is made by the reflection .
i had to move this part , but only about a millimeter .
and this one that i showed you before , of course , was a very complex .
it doesn &apos;t win or lose in this moment .
the emotional project between this object and forms is a <unk> <unk> , which is happening before you think about it .
i don &apos;t think we need to meet this choice .
it &apos;s also a thought we forget .
i think it &apos;s needed to go to the tradition of <unk> .
we don &apos;t think it &apos;s like this .
and at the end of the <unk> , they &apos;re all going to go and say , &quot; thank you <unk> , sarah is joseph , <unk> is jane <unk> . &quot;
the other thing is that art is not supposed to explain that artists should not tell you that artists should not tell you , because if they <unk> them , the magic and we thought it might be too simple .
art would be one of the tools where we can improve our society .
we probably don &apos;t think of what religions want to teach us , but we can see the institutional way that they &apos;re doing it .
absolutely . i meet , like many of you who say , &quot; is there not something that is bigger than we all have , something else ? &quot;
because if you were going to speak to 90 percent , because you &apos;ve got a similar view on so many things , and you &apos;re in the point of <unk> other things .
so he took me out of places like chile -- the <unk> desert in chile -- after college , in particular mines , in the british <unk> , in north america , to antarctica , to antarctica and even the south pole .
it &apos;s the largest lake in the world . it &apos;s 800 kilometers long .
and they &apos;re not going to believe it , but that after that , it will be the <unk> big telescope .
it was built by robert <unk> scott and his men , when they came to antarctica , at their first expedition , at the south expedition to the south expedition .
remember , these whole movements are doing people in the extreme cold , in <unk> temperatures .
this is a interesting statement , i &apos;m going to end up at the end of it .
what people first do is <unk> <unk> , where you can look inside the book , and that &apos;s fun .
there were pretty many people there .
but how do we see all of them ?
we &apos;ve got the 10 cents a page , if we &apos;re working with big agreement .
i &apos;m not sure i don &apos;t know what sarah means .
there &apos;s about two or three times a day of two or three <unk> .
with 15 dollars a hour , and about 100 to 150 dollars a hour of 150 dollars a hour , we can make materials very <unk> online , and we can see it in the net .
the question is : is that the world we want to live ?
governments are going to be <unk> .
we all know that the earth is problems .
after the way of <unk> , they <unk> them .
if you go through the landscape , it <unk> up to their shoes and trying to react with the <unk> .
across all of the <unk> of all of the <unk> of all of the <unk> of the <unk> of all of the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all of the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> of all of the <unk> .
some of these mushrooms are very happy .
this is a extraordinary <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;ve done something else that would have done something else else .
the box of life -- they get a dvd from the ted conference -- they give earth and water , and they &apos;ve got both <unk> and <unk> fungi , like <unk> , like <unk> mushrooms .
i &apos;ve been living in biosphere 2 .
we wanted to know , is that life is incredibly enough ?
i &apos;ve been able to eat myself all the same time .
and the doctor , the doctor showed us to make sure whether it was really good .
and all they went to me .
<unk> , at least a part of ethiopia , is one of these places that are amazing beautiful and incredibly <unk> , and i don &apos;t know how people make it to live there .
this is this beautiful picture , this is the amazon .
this is actually a <unk> .
i had to think about how to <unk> , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , but also , how to take the right person , you &apos;re going to get into a <unk> .
you put the <unk> , you put blood down , you put the blood , you looked at it under the microscope , put it down under the microscope , <unk> the culture .
but we need a <unk> , <unk> for patients .
and so this is how the medicine was sometimes .
we looked at <unk> <unk> , and we looked at the <unk> , and we found that they were technology and education , and then they have a little bit : they have pesticides .
and it &apos;s just hard .
so , these are really a lot of bees , and that &apos;s very important .
so that means that , and that means that there are their dead peoples are very good , and it could be able to be able to be able to be able to do a little bit .
and they take it up there , and <unk> their families in the year after twice a year .
governments , but in the minority of the minority .
let &apos;s take a cave in new york with a year of 15,000 muslims , now there are a thousand . that &apos;s like san francisco , within three years , the population was the population of half the <unk> .
but now , not all of us are <unk> , or <unk> , which we can move , and so you can still get a meadow in a <unk> <unk> .
and i went to the seventh night at my wife &apos;s family .
and to defend my title -- like <unk> and others that are doing this -- i thought i &apos;m going to go back to 2005 , and it won up again .
that &apos;s very <unk> .
why ?
the blue , the biggest creature on our planet . that &apos;s wrong , completely wrong .
during the night , they put their leaves , and they reduce the movement , and during the day , the leaves are <unk> -- then there &apos;s a lot more movement .
he wrote some very interesting letters on one of his friends , <unk> <unk> , after the president of the royal society , the biggest scientific authority in the u.k. , where he was talking about a <unk> .
we &apos;ve got the people only thought of people or the animals , when he was able to make a robot .
they don &apos;t know it &apos;s going to go .
and when it was to a common experience , it was funny and something that they could laugh .
i was inspired by it .
this is in 2005 .
they <unk> two of my guys who had the <unk> cameras in <unk> .
it &apos;s a wonderful way to spend a <unk> to spend in a <unk> <unk> .
the idea is still in the beginning , but it looks like this .
this is ted .
and this is the <unk> i want to stop .
now , children who are still not <unk> , is a special case .
they &apos;re a kind of <unk> .
the most exciting developments of natural selection are great , incredibly amazing .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done on this <unk> .
the ant is not alone .
you &apos;ve heard this guy just heard .
i think that &apos;s really .
well , i don &apos;t think that .
now , maybe we should use it .
it &apos;s the devil of talking . &quot;
so they &apos;re actually a chord , every one of them is a <unk> chord .
jh , if you don &apos;t understand anything from this talk , it &apos;s trying to listen to <unk> , and you can change your relationships .
the third problem with <unk> is the <unk> -- <unk> <unk> .
<unk> is a wonderful method .
i &apos;m going to leave you with <unk> , that &apos;s very good for them .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t know , but i can show you . &quot;
look at what &apos;s in the middle of the middle .
you look at this direction , so i &apos;m going to look at it here .
we had this little materials .
it &apos;s actually seven billion <unk> that all of their own passion , and all of the things as part of a <unk> come together and to create these world -- in their <unk> , and in their <unk> .
and yet , you can hear black holes , even if you &apos;re invisible , the reason that they &apos;re invisible .
our sun is not going to end up as black hole .
now , we &apos;ve never seen such a shadow of a black <unk> , but black holes can hear , even if they &apos;re invisible .
we can predict how that &apos;s going to sound .
it &apos;s also going to be a mission for outer space that hopefully i &apos;m going to start in the next 10 years . it &apos;s called clay .
and it comes closer and closer -- about 40,000 years ago , we had <unk> <unk> .
trees are <unk> .
that &apos;s what i think of movement .
we &apos;re critical to the west , the view of the west , which is the image of the west -- the image of what we &apos;re going to do , about our women , about our politics , about our politics , about our religion .
but instead of a country , i found a country that was completely <unk> , and i don &apos;t have more <unk> .
that iran once was a <unk> society , and we had a democracy , and that we had a democracy , and that was that democracy was <unk> .
i &apos;m sitting here to say that the iranian women have found a new voice , and your voice is my voice .
on this time , it should be a size , a <unk> , to focus on it .
there is no american compassion .
maybe the <unk> is right .
they learn to swim through swim by swim . they learn a <unk> .
the fossil of this animal will only have found in america -- a beautiful clear field here -- and in this part of africa .
you just look at these videos . if you &apos;re going to get out , you &apos;re just going to go back .
but i was thrilled , and so i started .
the <unk> academy is also there .
this is the <unk> and changing from functions .
the fact is that they &apos;re <unk> .
a lot of the efforts of the future of human beings are trying to do with the students to ask the students to teachers .
and the collaboration that they were doing with los altos , how did it happen ?
is it ready for the big <unk> ?
a few months ago , i got a call from a <unk> , in which i &apos;m working on .
but it &apos;s pretty simple , like a <unk> . &quot;
they said , &quot; who &apos;s this charles joseph ? &quot;
and for example , when his <unk> was asked him , he said , &quot; and who are these <unk> young men ? &quot;
and then , if you were there , the boy flew up , the young sudden , the young blogs , and there &apos;s 30 feet tall , and they &apos;re there .
these properties of a dialogue is not going to be .
there &apos;s a area in the <unk> part of this cloud , in the teeth and eyes , and this part of the cloud is active when people have the <unk> hallucinations .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t mean i don &apos;t mean . &quot;
sometimes i find them interesting . and i have a lot of images in my <unk> .
in switzerland , i &apos;ve done these photographs with a special camera , which is the <unk> of the darkness of the darkness car .
this <unk> for example of <unk> materials in the water , just like a <unk> , or <unk> a <unk> .
this looks like a plant , in fact , is actually a animal .
there &apos;s something little bit a little bit about it .
it should be the <unk> of the <unk> .
one thing was to draw a picture .
if we <unk> the <unk> in their two sources , you see that these things like teeth look like teeth .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
one is to be a <unk> .
again , these are all <unk> , scientific <unk> .
think of your eyes open and the head in motion .
and the ability to get concepts of things with pictures of objects and processes .
if the <unk> is still very thin , you can see with health and creative work to the world &apos;s <unk> .
i &apos;m here to <unk> them to support the way that people are able to change the way people and other creatures and other creatures .
it &apos;s not by the <unk> , but we &apos;re allowed by collective action that &apos;s made from the world .
the other big story of social <unk> is the tragedy of <unk> .
elizabeth , instead of his <unk> <unk> , treated this as a network of a network and <unk> them to produce better , even though they also have to be able to produce better , even though they &apos;re able to create better for their crops .
thank you .
thank you .
we &apos;re doing two different things here .
in fact , all of the things that we &apos;re going to go to do as well as well as well and <unk> -- cold , new conditions .
first of all , we &apos;ve evolved a little experiment where we gave people <unk> , and they asked them to build something like this .
and if you said , we &apos;ve got a new time , and while they said this <unk> , we &apos;ve got the other thing that they had done , again , apart .
there was a very nice relationship between love to sex , and the number of <unk> .
and i think that the ceo was basically not understood how important sense is .
but i should think about that , by the way , that in the <unk> , people might be killed .
people didn &apos;t want them .
and we had two kinds of people .
think about children .
and i think that in the industrial revolution , adam smith was the right thing as eric <unk> , but really we &apos;ve got <unk> . and now we &apos;re in the knowledge .
this is in today modern conflict , because children are very easy to send kids into the war .
and the <unk> of my mother was so bad that she was able to make our story <unk> to make all the young and girls &apos;s new <unk> names .
afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , and 70 percent of the population are <unk> .
they didn &apos;t want to do that . it &apos;s just happened . they &apos;ve lost control .
and 70 percent kills their lives .
i think that &apos;s all the thing that i &apos;ve been doing .
this is the european average .
on the right right , <unk> the same energy consumption per person , in about like canada , about 300 light bulbs per person , but the population density is 300 times bigger , 1,000 people per square kilometers .
if you want to get a lot of solar cells , you would have to take the traditional <unk> <unk> , where you &apos;re not only the roof , but also the landscape of solar cells .
and a third opportunity is nuclear power .
i tried it . it works . some people call it change .
in fact , as a boy , i was always trying to be a musician , and i wanted to be a musician and god , i &apos;m going to become a musician .
he &apos;s a boy from a community of a community , which was his <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with passion .
so they make new dreams , new goals and progress in the various different ways that music has to offer music .
this is a <unk> technology that helps you to make the simple challenge to get the right pill for the right sentence .
how do we call simple , <unk> technologies , and that &apos;s the first one of five sentences that i &apos;m going to talk to do in this talk .
that &apos;s happened this year . she went into the <unk> .
is the first word &quot; doctor . &quot;
many of these generation will not draw the button , even if you don &apos;t have an <unk> , because they don &apos;t want to get to the <unk> , even if you didn &apos;t have a long month for a long month .
the color shows different rooms in the house .
i &apos;m going to show you some of the latest and <unk> inventions of cybercriminals .
if you want you to put your <unk> , you &apos;re going to do it .
how do you get a <unk> <unk> in a company ?
so , let &apos;s think that our <unk> that we call for fun evil is called something <unk> .
there are some other interesting things that the cybercriminals have put together .
well , you probably wonder what &apos;s happening with these people .
in <unk> of them , i could identify north hotels where they were recently , <unk> , with <unk> precision in the world .
thank you .
the <unk> can recognize the <unk> , the <unk> can see the <unk> .
and they &apos;re in something that &apos;s probably the mobile phone , which is probably the <unk> of the bones .
we all know that these bones are <unk> , and when you put them in the <unk> , it shouldn &apos;t be just left .
the <unk> are the big , <unk> , who are extinct .
<unk> is also really cool .
a friend , a colleague , dr. hans <unk> on the <unk> university of the <unk> university .
people always say , &quot; why does you do that ?
and finally , i began to write my book to write the global scale of this problem , which shows a <unk> of the individual nations after the <unk> level of politicians in every country on the world .
so imagine , these nine <unk> that i found in the garbage that i found in the garbage is the global <unk> , ok ? at the beginning , we have nine .
now , this farmer spends about 26 pounds in the <unk> of <unk> , which he doesn &apos;t <unk> a sheet , because there &apos;s a little grass , because a little grass , the <unk> is not perfect , will be <unk> by pigs .
it &apos;s a living organism , i put a piece out , put it in a <unk> , and there was another two weeks ago .
and if you use these things , you don &apos;t need to do <unk> .
i &apos;m going to take a couple of <unk> . <unk> .
and then , after the <unk> .
we need to change stuff .
here &apos;s einstein , <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s great <unk> sentence , and i &apos;m not sure if that james <unk> or richard harris is .
and you can see how that <unk> <unk> , and then they &apos;re going to <unk> them down .
what a <unk> cat .
would the horse the horse .
&quot; 10 <unk> , 20 <unk> . &quot;
so , i said , if i look at a circle , you can see what &apos;s going on to shape , and , it &apos;s the red system .
it &apos;s got to be right ! it &apos;s about measurements , <unk> .
at the same time , there was only two more <unk> in the internet .
i &apos;m going to talk later to talk later .
i mean , all of my <unk> , that would be like a call called your <unk> , but for the entire world .
it might be made of people here from the audience .
now , if we had 350 years ago , there was a chance of <unk> , we would have had been talking about the current innovation of the military , about the massive <unk> like <unk> , and we could predict a era of stability in the world or in europe or europe .
now , in this environment , where you don &apos;t know if the potential enemy is going to work on defense or desire , and whether the weapons of <unk> , this environment is what &apos;s going to be a conflict .
it &apos;s a huge blue area .
so , would you have ever done in the time to see how a dinosaurs looked like a dinosaur , like a dinosaurs looked like a dinosaur .
it can &apos;t always go , and they &apos;re going to send their threads down ; they have to end up the pants .
he never seems to want to go to a certain girl .
but what i did was a <unk> .

it &apos;s going to be a kind of urgency of urgency , such as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible .
my <unk> was wonderful <unk> : <unk> of the wild and <unk> .

audience : small .
audience : <unk> .
audience : 11 .
okay . so , i &apos;m trying to do the impossible -- or at least a sense .
audience : november . what ?
of course , i could make a answer , and they wouldn &apos;t know . i &apos;m ready to do it .
ok , oh , ok -- you also have a <unk> ?
let me explain what that is .

and i think , ah , the quarter of the length of the length is <unk> .
you would think of it , with all this extra space , we would have a lot of space for all our stuff .
it &apos;s time that i &apos;m <unk> by this .
could i have a little bit more freedom ?
north of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in october , and november , there was no ice on the <unk> bay .

their own personal <unk> is unique , and often nothing that we &apos;re interested in .
it &apos;s <unk> by a sense of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and success .
as you think that the media is going to make their work or the science of what their work is , what their work is about , like , like the <unk> , about that , like , like , &quot; oh , the <unk> -- that play is <unk> .
the difference between our <unk> and the <unk> <unk> is that our fact is actually a <unk> .
<unk> : and then , after a brief <unk> in liquid nitrogen to get this perfect <unk> , we really have something that looks like the original <unk> , we really have something that looks like the original .
and , in fact , the <unk> in paris , his report about the people who have <unk> together .
greg miller is telling us the news about the news .
it allows it to be able to look at the negative forms that you &apos;re going to be able to look at , as you go to their everyday <unk> .
so for this project , we &apos;ve developed a kind of intelligent <unk> <unk> .

in order to say that these viruses in the past may probably have been extinct in the past , in those <unk> societies are probably extinct .
you tell what you &apos;re doing with the help of 140 symbols or less and less and people are interested in this <unk> .

and slowly , i realized that my american roommate knew that my american roommate heard of the only story , and i had to have seen , just like this professor , who told me that my novel is not &quot; eternal <unk> . &quot;
let &apos;s go to the story of the british budget with the <unk> , and not with the <unk> of the british budget , you told a very different story .

if you want to get a fish , you get a woman and if you need a woman , you get a fish . &quot;
and if it &apos;s going to be a better way , you can still grow the battery , and you &apos;re going to <unk> on the island of the island .
this is after today , the <unk> of the united states of the united states .
in india , you don &apos;t understand where the problem is , because most indians are going to be <unk> every single one or three .
all of what we need is 10 percent of natural energy .
we &apos;re not going to go back to that . maybe we &apos;re going to be free , and you &apos;re going to use the <unk> .
the hell of the so-called <unk> are the same old issues that they &apos;re always doing , and they were always taken back to the time , since darwin was time to be a day .
the <unk> of natural selection is so amazing , because they &apos;re the problem to explain complexity , in the form of nothing else as simplicity .
now the next one : &quot; the president of the royal society has a strong internal belief , &quot; -- -- -- &quot; ... that &apos;s a asteroid killed the dinosaurs . &quot;
it feels in a <unk> minority , but how do the american atheists are actually made together ?
i don &apos;t have the same numbers for <unk> other fields like history or philosophy , but i &apos;d be amazed if they were different .
darwin was thinking that atheism we &apos;ve been doing right now and good for the <unk> , that the <unk> people , but i think , quote , &quot; don &apos;t work . &quot;
if people like -- if agnes like stephen hawking and albert einstein &apos;s word the word &quot; god , you use it as an awful metaphor for this <unk> , <unk> part of the physics that we don &apos;t even understand .
and the lab costs about 500 dollars , in about the value of 10,000 today .
in the other time , at the <unk> , a person who was <unk> in a field , and it had to decide whether this is in a field , and it had to decide whether this is a <unk> or <unk> .
it &apos;s because it &apos;s a certain sense of a certain sense or a number of <unk> , like wikipedia , <unk> a certain sentence of social relationships .
i don &apos;t have the slides , you &apos;re going to be able to be able to be <unk> with me .
a study of the <unk> for africa has shown that there is a clear <unk> in 28 african countries .
the state should not be in the source of and services and services , because it &apos;s alcohol and <unk> is on this area .
but what it looks like , it was the <unk> that we had protected our economic development -- that &apos;s because , when the oil is coming up , our economy grew up very quickly .
the same thing we do in <unk> .
in fact , i &apos;d like to tell you that you see this .
he called it , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; which means that they could kill 100 million people in the next 50 years .
until recently , we didn &apos;t have to know how a vaccine was right .
the main challenge for these two viruses is that they &apos;re changing all the time .
so these drugs are not a cure , but they &apos;re going to give a huge triumph of science because it &apos;s the <unk> death of a <unk> at least for the people who have access to them .
but you know , the research that happened in hiv has helped us very much with the progress for other diseases .
this was a slow , <unk> process that was dependent on <unk> , millions of living <unk> .
and based on the awful <unk> production , and the huge <unk> of the <unk> <unk> method , for example , i &apos;ve just talked about -- look at the <unk> time -- that would be <unk> life .
so the challenge is a full force .
the question is just : why ?
do you know the african union is going to organize a conference ?
there are some things you need to know .
the study that i was here on the stage was <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , which is that we had <unk> leaders in africa .
by using it from their <unk> people .
curiosity , africans hate the africans -- they hate <unk> .
they decide what they &apos;re doing .
he doesn &apos;t get the help of the government , and he takes a second , <unk> boat .
something that would all connect us to each other .
scott said , it was full of it .
and the challenge for <unk> filters is that they filter this balance , because they &apos;re looking at this balance , because they &apos;re looking at it , what you &apos;re thinking about .
it &apos;s about the new ideas of <unk> , and to new people and strangers .
and the man said , &quot; really beautiful <unk> , what ? &quot;
i know that you &apos;re going to end up on other bad <unk> -- i &apos;m just fun -- but now i &apos;m going to show a short <unk> , and then i &apos;m going to show you new material about possible solutions .
and in fact , it &apos;s going to be going to be a gram of <unk> 2.0 , where you &apos;re going to be able to take a gram of <unk> <unk> .
again , at all of you here : it shouldn &apos;t be about <unk> .
what i really told me is that they &apos;re <unk> <unk> .
and there &apos;s no one of the people trying to use a few people trying to use the beach to use the beach .
we have evidence that bacteria eat oil ?
this <unk> was all over the ocean .
when the japanese <unk> war , they were <unk> , they were going to go back to the same time .
what &apos;s the <unk> of the birds , i don &apos;t want to make <unk> <unk> of people who are able to do the birds .
all right , people who tell you as beautiful , if you really wanted to be right , and they wanted to be <unk> , then they should send these <unk> to <unk> .
it &apos;s about right and wrong .
and i &apos;ve evolved a system to produce medical <unk> .
all right , &quot; i &apos;m more than my genes , &quot; -- all together .
i don &apos;t ask you to <unk> it because it &apos;s true , but to remind you about it .
they have a molecule that we have to know as <unk> .
and this is just a <unk> . it &apos;s a lot of smaller than a human <unk> .
now , neurons , like trees , can grow new areas , can grow new areas and lose old .
and we can even talk about <unk> .
if you <unk> this number , you can see that there is a big potential for <unk> in the brain .
it &apos;s going to be able to be able to be able to be able to teach ourselves from the <unk> and <unk> of our own brain .
he &apos;s currently working on music and <unk> with his company , the <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;ve got a brilliant experiment here to show you that .
ks : no , no .
when he did that , he noticed a unexpected thing .
ks : how does this work is : there &apos;s a matrix of <unk> .
beautiful , right ?
and a couple of months ago , i sent a friend to this guy , eduardo believed .
so a huge symbol for a couple of weeks ago .
but he still did .
so his farm is incredible .
and then he found this wild plant , which is <unk> .
and then they fly in the circle .
i finally came to try to try to try to try to try it before i went .
no salt , no taste , no oil , no <unk> .
what does that mean ?
at least , at least . i think it &apos;s like this .
trees who are going to go on the nature to find solutions , to find answers , rather than nature &apos;s solutions .
and from the second to the new fire , is to change two big stories about oil and electricity that are both the two fifth of the fossil <unk> in the air .
our fuel for mobility is to three old of cars .
you can put it up to <unk> : it &apos;s harder than titan .
and <unk> and planes can use affordable hydrogen or more <unk> <unk> .
even better light and <unk> and so forth , the <unk> <unk> is about a third .
now , in about 20 times , private <unk> <unk> efficiency , without the <unk> <unk> of their roofs , and it <unk> their <unk> .
and what we &apos;re doing it also is to replace it , it &apos;s going to be the same cost : about six trillion dollars in <unk> -- we &apos;re going to buy more of them , which we have , or new power , and that &apos;s <unk> <unk> , or renewable , that are more or less <unk> .
so this is based on results , and not insecure , to focus , <unk> and conflict to the <unk> solution to the <unk> of america .
i just noticed that what i had killed , two <unk> of his entire family .
so this simple <unk> shows that plants in areas where the most kids are going to go to school , not the schools that were going to be <unk> . this is how new questions .
two years ago , at the age of april 2010 , i called my father .
i don &apos;t try to make the toothbrush .
we remind us , and can that in every book of my <unk> son , that life was made four billion years ago -- four billion <unk> two ?
so , i &apos;m not quite sure .
there are <unk> , there are <unk> . there &apos;s a case : the vertical .
you &apos;ve been thinking , you &apos;ve got time to talk about art , to talk about art and these things .
you go back to the future , back , back , back to that .
they all come from families where most of the people are going to be home , mostly the mother or grandmother , and they come to their education and their structure here .
we put them down to the right and on the left , so that you can tell you , so you can tell the consequences , and you know the consequences , if you go .
let &apos;s take all online online . &quot;
it &apos;s <unk> .
they said , &quot; this is enough to <unk> .
then you can support us . this is the challenge of you . &quot;
but i have to have to have my <unk> .
you can listen and choose .
let &apos;s look for example of the <unk> <unk> .
if you think about wikipedia in the concept of wikipedia , and at the end , you &apos;ve got the greatest encyclopedia of the world .
there are many people who have the same dream .
a website was created .
there was no leaders .
communications is used to be <unk> .
the modern tools of neuroscience shows us that what happens there is a incredibly complex process .
we can &apos;t stop our own language apart , but not the average languages .
we <unk> that by the american babies who never heard a second language , at the beginning of the most critical phase of the most critical phase .
it might look like a <unk> of mars .
science on the one side has a very rational approach to their environment , while art on the other side , is basically a emotional approach to the environment .
now , i &apos;ve got a <unk> over here to show you that .
let me show you this over here .
the dalai lama once said , &quot; love and compassion are <unk> .
the <unk> were <unk> by a small girl who was <unk> by a small girl .
it &apos;s part of every human <unk> .
and if compassion is so good for us , why don &apos;t we choose compassion ?
the governor is full of maggots .
would you like the <unk> , and honestly , who don &apos;t like it ?
we &apos;re starting with a <unk> , and then we ask a different <unk> .
then there was <unk> <unk> , a <unk> .
i said , &quot; he &apos;s been perfectly dead .
&quot; i said , &quot; well , &quot; i don &apos;t have <unk> . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have a <unk> . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i said , &quot; what does you do here ? &quot;
so i went to the <unk> , and i saw this indian guy .
julian tempest : if you asked him to hate him , he said : magic is the only <unk> job .
where is the queen ?
i &apos;m going to show you how extremely terrorism is connected to our daily life .
at the time , when i met the red brigades , i also discovered that their life is not from ideology and politics , but from economic <unk> .
i think a lot of people thought i had a little <unk> .
but , of course , they went into serious <unk> with the <unk> crime .
this money was made in <unk> and <unk> <unk> -- in the bar , understand .
no one wants to control the <unk> of his <unk> , and it &apos;s going to be <unk> with customers .
some of you may think , &quot; wait time . you don &apos;t think it &apos;s not necessarily like a <unk> .
right , i wanted to leave my <unk> , but what i just didn &apos;t have seen was that it &apos;s extremely uncomfortable to leave his <unk> .
and there i &apos;ve really learned that , the bigger the challenge , the bigger thing of a special performance , if you get to the end .
well , i thought the atlantic was big , but the sun is really very big .
but it didn &apos;t go without <unk> .
it &apos;s this little green line on the horizon , which is what they &apos;re very nervous because of the <unk> level .
we can start to meet better , <unk> , sustainable choices .
<unk> <unk> : why i think about the sun
this is the world trade <unk> on the board .
why ? why ? why ?
he doesn &apos;t see the <unk> cost . he doesn &apos;t use extra time .
they were able to do that .
and at the end , it &apos;s about comfort , it &apos;s about that they feel good in places that they didn &apos;t expect before .
and that &apos;s hard if you don &apos;t know who you are .
and i asked myself , how can it be so easy to give my dreams ?
it &apos;s not so hard to ask somebody <unk> , and one day , i said , &quot; sure , you can <unk> my homework , &quot; and i gave him the wrong answer that i had died in night before .
we &apos;ve got both of the <unk> in the classroom , so we &apos;re not <unk> with <unk> .
maybe you &apos;ve brought your <unk> and <unk> teeth , but never told him , because how can you tell you yourself , if all of you want to be able to be in the way you want you to be in the <unk> ?
that &apos;s french science .
okay , so forth .
if you look at these trucks here , it &apos;s the biggest trucks on the earth .
it &apos;s also one of the reasons why it &apos;s the biggest and the fastest <unk> of co2 in canada , and it &apos;s also the reason why canada &apos;s number three is the number three is in terms of <unk> per head .
and as a father , i just don &apos;t imagine what the soul is doing .
by using that , we get a big part of our biggest <unk> and replace it with the most greenhouse gases <unk> oil in the future of the future .
the <unk> of their work is the <unk> that you can buy in every store and you can buy millions of indian women every day on their forehead , and it &apos;s about a ritual that &apos;s very closely with the institution of marriage .
<unk> <unk> was born in <unk> , in <unk> , and in london .
i hope to convince you that complex and complicated and complicated is not always the same .
the <unk> <unk> is the one that we want to change -- the public support for the government .
so , in my first tedtalk , in my first tedtalk , we should spend the planet 21 billion hours a week with video games .
only 10,000 minutes per day would have been able to be an important <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> increase of joy .
why a game ?
how could a <unk> game like this is a huge effect in so serious , sometimes <unk> situations ?
there are four kinds of strength , or our creativity is related growth , and there are synthetic <unk> things that you can do every day to do every day to make these particles , you don &apos;t need to use a <unk> .
more practice is going to be <unk> .
here &apos;s another secret for you : if you shake somebody &apos;s hand six seconds , you &apos;re going to shake the <unk> in your blood , which is called the <unk> .
and in this project , in fact , there are hundreds of people around the world , and we &apos;re doing that with us , in fact , hundreds of thousands of people around this project , many of his different things .
and then a couple of people came from chicago and said , &quot; end in 2007 is the theater of chicago , the global warming . we &apos;ve got a <unk> meter big gallery , and we want you to put them up with their reef . &quot;
<unk> and <unk> are not just two concepts that happen well .
<unk> said , &quot; how can i define innovative lines ? &quot;
<unk> . they &apos;re <unk> . it &apos;s really exactly the same thing .
so this is how we &apos;ve got out , <unk> <unk> , the evidence that the most famous <unk> of mathematics is wrong .
and their individual ideas , and their relationships with this mathematical method .
this particular <unk> trait -- the <unk> -- that &apos;s my opinion after the <unk> institute of neuroscience , the neuroscience , and then we &apos;re going to understand what &apos;s going on .
this person is less at <unk> mind and intelligent . but if he sees his mother , it &apos;s his <unk> and he says it &apos;s not his mom .
so if this area is going to breathe , they lose the ability to see faces .
<unk> and chairs and <unk> -- nothing happens , just like to normal people . if i &apos;m going to show him a picture of his mom , the <unk> activity is low .
he knows that his arm is not there . nonetheless , it &apos;s a <unk> , <unk> experience .
maybe you can &apos;t solve the <unk> , the <unk> in the phantom of the phantom .
and my pain are gone . &quot;
he said , &quot; no , the last three days , i didn &apos;t have a phantom , and so , there &apos;s no <unk> in the elbow , no <unk> , not <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> . all my pain are gone .
<unk> is blue , <unk> is green , a different tone could be yellow .
that &apos;s the key .
which is <unk> , which is <unk> ?
their <unk> is too <unk> , which most of us don &apos;t deal with .
this is <unk> .
none of the things you &apos;re going to see in this video is <unk> .
good job .
he learned that , if he took both hands out of the hands , with his <unk> <unk> <unk> , a lot of bigger and <unk> <unk> .
one of the way that it means is a hut in the woods .
does he mean , where the sound comes ?
because we believe it &apos;s not the biology , but the culture .
and some stars die in <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of this .
on the right side , gravity is the gravity . einstein has explained that .
and beyond the way , they make new kinds of change .
it was still too early , but he was a moral <unk> , a inspiration for scientists who were worried about the control of the weapons of weapons .
so let &apos;s go to <unk> living systems in the cosmos of far outside the cosmos in the cosmos , and not only for 40 years , but it &apos;s all about 40 years ago , but the whole year of the <unk> of the earth .
martin <unk> asks : is this our last century ?
and it becomes even worse : &quot; i would make a picture of it and a dozen <unk> .
now , these are students , so they gave a lot of money for things like <unk> and <unk> .
and then we asked them back , how happy they are .
but extremely different correctness .
these are <unk> in mutations .
the team that we gave money to spend it has been to spend each other to other teams , to other teams , and in the end of the end , in the end of the <unk> .
if we hear about the <unk> , from the high <unk> , is going to be often known that this is another one of the <unk> conflict of the middle east , that the roots are as old as the region itself .
ironically , that was a time when the <unk> of iran was working with washington , and not the destruction of israel .
so this is a analogy that &apos;s going to do is to create diplomacy , diplomacy , the diplomacy is inevitable , the war is inevitable .
you can look at a certain <unk> , or you can look at the different regions , and you compare them .
the map of <unk> <unk> at the end of 2009 was not so good as they could have to be , not as good as the map of california .
the trick is .
the explanation , she said , &quot; he was not <unk> . &quot; he was not <unk> . &quot;
this system wants to get the status of the status , also the status of the <unk> government .
so it &apos;s not about that my theme is the most important thing . that &apos;s not .
we can &apos;t do anything . &quot;
collaborator lessig : we have to follow the republic of the republic .
for example , some of the people in this room are going to be going to be invited with a child to school .
that &apos;s what i mean on my pen . &quot;
everybody &apos;s just a little bit easier .
i don &apos;t want to tell you that the law of entropy isn &apos;t true , it &apos;s true .
here in the model , you see the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you see in north america , they are like so many things in the united states , and they ignore each other . they ignore each other .
every one of their <unk> depends on this critical region , the <unk> , which is about the 10,000 independent cells , which has a electronic rhythm -- a high tension , a high tension , a low sheet -- to send the <unk> of a signal .
they were a lot of <unk> , <unk> , but apart .
so , i &apos;d like to show you a couple of interviews with people who were going to come to the front of the bridge and describe what happened .
now , you &apos;re not going to go to a <unk> , but we &apos;re all going to walk -- we &apos;re all going to go back and go back to it .
im : this is just a few tons , so you &apos;re going to go very quickly .
but the <unk> scientist in his area .
i didn &apos;t say what the list was , but she was in <unk> evidence , and i told them , they should look at their names , your <unk> , or the <unk> of your mother .
yet , perhaps this <unk> , or maybe a <unk> , which is not necessarily <unk> , a <unk> against disease or <unk> or a different trait that is useful for climate change , and they don &apos;t have the other thing .
we &apos;re going to see children in television .
so the idea with <unk> was that it &apos;s cold , so you have natural temperatures under the <unk> .
and if anything happens , you can come and draw it down .
thank you .
look at your <unk> ! this is not right .
maybe any woman , a lady ? -- thank you .
you &apos;ve just tried two concepts -- two in the united states , and one of the russians .
<unk> ! i &apos;ve got to talk about innovation -- the things that are developing , there are a lot of activity , and then they &apos;re going to be <unk> by something else and die of something else .
i can &apos;t tell you when it &apos;s going on , because i don &apos;t want the competition to see the competition .
i mean something really interesting that &apos;s going to happen here .
ok , let &apos;s talk a little bit about the commercial development of <unk> space .
it &apos;s like the air .
after a few years , he &apos;s ready to give attention , but one day he had a <unk> .
institutions are going to be <unk> , and if you &apos;re <unk> , you know , the consequences is , you know , the consequences .
the fourth meaning of openness and the fourth principle , is <unk> .
the <unk> is from the <unk> .
you know that bees and fish in <unk> lives .
all around us have an medical revolution , a revolution that will help us to help some of the worst diseases of our society , cancer with education .
this is a tumor , dark , gray , a <unk> mass , <unk> in a brain .
and you can see that the ring of the blood is coming out of treatment .
but the question is : how good work is this in practice ?
here &apos;s what happens when we add a <unk> . it <unk> angiogenesis on very efficient .
but even more interesting about the study of the study that the men have evolved , so that the people who have created more <unk> , which is the only less blood vessels that have killed their cancer .
<unk> from <unk> said , &quot; complexity is to see what all of you &apos;ve seen , and think about what &apos;s going to be seen . &quot;
i &apos;m a <unk> . i &apos;m <unk> magazine .
it &apos;s got to do fun , different than ordinary problems that i don &apos;t say , really , is not a very <unk> puzzle .
one is the background of the other .
you can &apos;t do that , you can &apos;t do it , but on a computer , it &apos;s about it .
i wanted to do a conductor .
what &apos;s going to be able to get there right now ?
so there are games like &quot; the brain , &quot; for the <unk> , &quot; is a <unk> .
just like a black character . where is that ?
i really believe that a girl , so powerful is that we &apos;ve all had to have to be able to be able to be so much .
i remember , as an example of my father , who was very , very unlikely to me .
we &apos;re going to be used so much , girls of the <unk> , <unk> of their own life that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do things , and they were able to be able to get them in .
and she looked at the eyes of their babies and said , &quot; of course , i love my baby . how could i not love my baby ?
when we were there , they &apos;ve done a ritual where they were girls who are <unk> , with their families .
and i &apos;m going to be on the rest of your life on your side . &quot;
i love it that i don &apos;t take the things easy .
why would you want to <unk> me , <unk> ?
so , in the actual process , all six teenagers said , and <unk> the <unk> that they had done on the orchestra .
but the event came up in the middle of january , on the galapagos , in the galapagos , about seven o &apos;clock night .
this is 10 feet away .
and what does this example is -- what &apos;s important for us to stop in memory ?
he was a very religious man .
i got a <unk> and spent a year through africa , where i asked people , why they built <unk> , which is a great job if you can get it .
and that &apos;s what it is in some villages to the <unk> level .
it &apos;s not really moral knowledge .
he said , &quot; if i lived in the <unk> , i would use just a long time , because it &apos;s very fast , and it &apos;s very cheap , and they &apos;re very cheap .
just and surprisingly , a little bit <unk> .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> .
the bad news is .
instead of looking at friends or <unk> , they looked at the workplace .
today , <unk> development is used in a hundred countries , and it &apos;s <unk> to the <unk> .
the fear of disease are losing . <unk> .
we ask a couple of rules on it and think about them .
the conversation will go better . &quot;
now , when i go back to night , to come here , one of my daughters started in front of my daughters .
and we developed 10 questions .
i was a teenager when i was the first time , &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and the famous first sentence read , &quot; all the good families found on each other .
i want to show you how something changes so beautiful .
if i have this in the water , you &apos;re going to see a <unk> <unk> , and this <unk> is the <unk> , which is the water of the <unk> of the <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
with all the young boys in his cave in his cave . ed : <unk> ...
i &apos;m going to show you .
but it wasn &apos;t <unk> . it wasn &apos;t been <unk> .
one thing that i want to see is that not all of the people are going to wear <unk> .
we can put them up or <unk> , or you can see it .
he &apos;s one of five children .
i &apos;ve shown you that we can do it in the <unk> of the <unk> of depression .
we &apos;re trying to understand what these circuits are , and what the current brain is for the clinical signs and symptoms of these diseases are responsible .
evolution works in reality rather than an <unk> as a engineer .
that &apos;s enough !
what we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a person like richard , or this is a <unk> or a <unk> or a <unk> , which is relative <unk> of this spring , is the same thing that we &apos;ve seen before .
okay . the point is really hard to say , not true ? it &apos;s incredible ; it &apos;s incredible , students tried it , and they couldn &apos;t say it .
he &apos;s doing this with a <unk> combination .
so what we &apos;re doing is we take the hair as an <unk> , and we put them together with a different colleagues from berkeley .
in fact , that from the <unk> <unk> leaders , two thirds of the <unk> men have children , but only one third of the <unk> women .
i left san francisco , my <unk> , my <unk> , and he flew to this conference .
and we go out at the end , look at us and say , &quot; how is it going to come to you ? &quot;
there &apos;s a famous study of harvard business school about a woman named <unk> <unk> .
and i took my hand back back to me , and i was looking at all other other women , and then you &apos;ve got more questions , only from men . &quot;
and one woman <unk> me , and i looked at her -- she saw something young .
thank you .
they don &apos;t do it as well as they should , but they &apos;re doing it .
so fear was the <unk> factor .
but it &apos;s in the middle of the black .
i want to talk about the following thing about thinking about how we get in this country , how we get to deal with information .
that &apos;s why they &apos;re in <unk> , awful language . and that &apos;s working .
we tell them that all of you are right now ; it &apos;s good .
this patient is about 50 , we can &apos;t say pretty much exactly how big his risk is to be in cancer .
they don &apos;t need to be the <unk> of the audience in this room .
and this cartoon had just said , &quot; i &apos;m going to give me this <unk> , this <unk> , i &apos;m going to get the camera , and then i go down . &quot;
and if you talk about nature who &apos;s as a author of my favorite , how is the idea of the <unk> ?
all right , we &apos;re all <unk> .
the only technology here is the cheap <unk> : pretty new , to a <unk> , even i could get a <unk> of 10 <unk> in 15 minutes .
if a <unk> <unk> , the grass is going to be on this height of this height , and it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s really interesting .
and now i say that i want to build a form of games on the world , but that &apos;s not true , because it &apos;s already in development ; it &apos;s happened .
if you don &apos;t , it &apos;s bad . there &apos;s nothing that you can do .
come to a certain time , you get their <unk> to half the price .
and then you can really do a lot of different ways .
and it &apos;s powerful .
<unk> is a human dynamic that tries to find the best news to find the most important stories .
we &apos;ve talked about a couple of years ago .
you also see if i put this around here -- hopefully i don &apos;t get the world to be very much .
you can see , this is what it started .
this is one of our engineers .
<unk> , which is actually <unk> students to teach students , the law of the source , just as a <unk> form .
raise your hands .
it makes it to a place where it &apos;s fun to work .
and therefore , this is what we &apos;re working on , and we even have people who are excited about and crazy enough that they &apos;re working on it , that &apos;s really their goal .
thank you .
what i said , as he said , he was trying to get the experience , was the experience by the landscape .
what does life feel easier , angry ?
and the part of them , they &apos;re doing this by you , instead of building a great new system that used to build the <unk> of one of their hospitals .
today , the industrial systems of time in the time of <unk> , and they have become part of the current problem .
and how depression can we do by the way that we have <unk> , a bigger effect .
and i was surprised by my <unk> <unk> , the <unk> with his <unk> .
robert <unk> , and i &apos;ve tried in a series of studies to answer exactly this question .
yet , it &apos;s exactly what the american paradigm takes .
but for the <unk> , the <unk> of all of these <unk> on the market is like a <unk> .
the americans even discover that <unk> choice in theory seem to seem better than in practice .
<unk> parents would be more interesting to tell things like , &quot; <unk> was only for the short time , but he was doing so much that he taught us so much .
robert <unk> once said this , &quot; it &apos;s poetry that &apos;s lost . &quot;
&quot; well , it &apos;s a very <unk> <unk> of pink . &quot;
the three problems have one in common : they &apos;re <unk> problems that are used by natural processes .
so thank you very much .
it &apos;s going to replace competition by collaboration .
and then we &apos;re building a <unk> , which we can test the <unk> performance of machines , and so we can do very , very quickly .
girl 5 : no .
and so , i realized that the <unk> of the best is not going to be understood as an <unk> movement , but as a <unk> movement .
the <unk> comes to the stage .
and then you would be able to be able to be able to use energy , the rest of los angeles , <unk> the rest of los angeles .
and then you take it up and put it on the screen of the screen , and it &apos;s on the outside of the outside , just like this .
if you put the word to the word , or this is very true , it &apos;s very true that his point is really true that his essence is really a very <unk> .
i think it was this leadership that has been <unk> .
ph : i hope you understand how <unk> it is .
and finally , the race of the future has won up the future , as the <unk> , <unk> .
mm : because it &apos;s a role of the audience to do something to do something .
they produce things for 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute .
and where television is going to be built , which is built , is a very exciting new way of communication , and we have the <unk> of two industries and a new way of thinking about it .
this is a spanish architect and designers .
it can see simple images , simple materials : if i go through new york , i &apos;m going to do it .
and we &apos;ve been given to me -- maybe there &apos;s a yellow day in san francisco , and we all talk about , and we all talk about a few installations .
the way that the city has taken the city for the public space , is great , almost an international model .
even the parts of the airplane had french names .
he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s more girls there . &quot;
and this was what i did , after some <unk> and <unk> , in the design of the scene of the chair that i &apos;ve got to show you right now .
he said , they have one of the new , better chairs .
or you put them up in the way that you &apos;re in the position .
but i knew about experience , and when i put myself in the offices , where it was <unk> with <unk> , that never would have never come to the idea of the idea , <unk> , to put it into a <unk> , and i adapt to <unk> them in the position to get them in the position .
and <unk> has evolved in <unk> .
two days ago , or yesterday , i can &apos;t remind me just that i &apos;ve read in a <unk> read that <unk> <unk> was the first <unk> <unk> , about about a $ 400 <unk> cases , with about 400 <unk> cases .
we need something that was really <unk> , so he doesn &apos;t change the disease .
here &apos;s a typical situation : males is the female , every lot of offspring .
so <unk> is not our biggest problem .
&quot; why now ? &quot; why ? &quot;
and most of the time , i don &apos;t see myself , even though i &apos;m a <unk> <unk> .
look at the <unk> data .
now , our mobile tissue can create a story of our <unk> .
bill <unk> : your health depends on where they live .
this is my grandfather .
in the simple reason that nobody wants to talk about it .
so , in fact , <unk> , plants are doing phosphorus through water from the ground .
this is the title of a remarkable <unk> from the nature of the nature of nature , which is the discussion about the power of power .
eighty percent of it &apos;s going to be mentioned .
and instead of a quarter of 100 percent , we take one of 25 percent .
we have a working technology , and one that &apos;s going to use in <unk> uses some of the <unk> that we &apos;re going to do on the <unk> of the world .
and he was a call <unk> : he looked at all the <unk> and mutations to find rules and laws , instead of looking at the norms .
and in this example , you can see that the individual <unk> , but they <unk> it without being <unk> .
as an architect , i just think about relationships between the parts and the whole thing , but in terms of power , it will always be more <unk> for business .
we <unk> us on the level of the <unk> of the building , where we could build the five different towers of the building , but they should all be on the <unk> floor to a single <unk> mass .
so let &apos;s go back , a couple of years later , in 2003 , and we &apos;re going to see that this landscape is really told about <unk> as a <unk> .
the difference is especially in <unk> in <unk> in the desert , or maybe <unk> in <unk> , whatever they want .
here there is a lot of toxic garbage , a lot of things that were illegal , and now on the air .
we have the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in the world , just only by rain , just by sadness , the huge problems of water cells , in rivers , south , and even oceans , and it &apos;s also the most important <unk> for <unk> .
but we can do that , and there are opportunities .
matt is the biggest <unk> on the <unk> .
work together .
so , what is that , what &apos;s going to be in the <unk> ?
we want to see our products in the store . &quot;
the whole system is not going to control the <unk> .
we interact with the world through our hands .
what do you do ?
we use biological <unk> to <unk> these <unk> -- muscles .
this is what this looks like .
so here we <unk> , or <unk> the <unk> , from small parts of the <unk> , and we had other <unk> that we had our <unk> -- signal , two other people who <unk> our hand -- signal .
ak : it works good .
but i can &apos;t get a <unk> , and say , &quot; there &apos;s it . &quot;
and this is our goal -- a little bit of <unk> <unk> to wear .
this is jesse , and he <unk> a <unk> .
so thank you .
in fact , this network is largely , there are 22 million people living with hiv life , which is <unk> 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected in the world .
people have to have to have a lot of emotion <unk> for leaders in clinical trials that are used in the different developing developing countries that are used in the different developing world and the <unk> of the study of the study of the study .
so , the fundamental problems that we &apos;re living with is a very high consumption and a lot of people .
so they &apos;re going to get all the criteria that people don &apos;t want to do .
so you see this electricity , which is at north -- the <unk> in this case -- the <unk> in this case -- and this <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , who &apos;s going to go down to the <unk> .
we also know that it &apos;s not just <unk> , but the <unk> and the other <unk> .
now , i want to show you that penguins are going to be <unk> .
coca-cola has <unk> <unk> , with his <unk> , and we put it in , and he goes in and he comes in here .
and then there &apos;s another thing that comes out to be <unk> .
now , here &apos;s a fundamental problem that we don &apos;t have solved : our fundamental political suffering .
both of the parts are a pretty long border .
again , like in the case of <unk> , china didn &apos;t <unk> russia . it <unk> it .
in <unk> countries , china is reduced to the <unk> , so that <unk> and cambodia would sell cheaper , and they &apos;re going to sell cheaper to china .
what i want to show you here , i call <unk> , day a day .
these two arrows form a <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> and other infrastructure that <unk> the west bank of the west bank .
a lot of them .
so what &apos;s next ? how does the future is the future of european union ?
matt countries , and in the same time , most of the <unk> lines on the map of the map .
this dream exists .
is it bad ? it doesn &apos;t seem like that .
okay .
and the way that the hormone is <unk> the growth of growth .
so how can a force end up the speed of language ?
we think that insulin and <unk> are creatures that are complex under <unk> circumstances -- in good times -- if food is there , and not a lot of stress in the environment that exists , and not a lot of stress in the environment .
we don &apos;t know the details about how it works , but we know that foxo genes have a impact on the lifespan of people .
in fact , you could increase the genes .
so it &apos;s possible that the process that i talked about , which is happening in the <unk> , which is a different normal <unk> , like a bird , like a bird , so that the bird can live much longer .
they &apos;re never going to see one of these layer , because nike wants to buy your shoes .
they all show the heroes that were <unk> .
it &apos;s like the attempt to go against a <unk> .
this point is that many <unk> <unk> like malaria in the principle of the brain is basically changing the chemistry of the brain , as if in fact , the brain is the brain of a chemical soup .
and my <unk> colleague , i believe this is also what &apos;s going to be .
so , in the <unk> , we found that an opera , a lot longer needed for the <unk> , and when we <unk> the genes that <unk> in this mutation , and we could discover the genes that we could discover in this mutation .
this question you &apos;ve been asked for for a long time , but in a fly , we can actually test it .
so , like that , it turns out in the dark , using us <unk> . they smell us .
so you can see it , that &apos;s the cheese .
people even told me that they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> .
and every time i felt the <unk> of the eyes of the eyes of the eyes of me .
and as <unk> , fat is one of the best sources of adults for adults .
while we &apos;re talking about <unk> of the clinical trials , the study of stem cells for <unk> .
we &apos;re very happy because we &apos;ve got the opportunity to have these circles in the world , not only in our country : venezuela . in our entire world .
so what happens when that &apos;s not happening ?
but here you see what &apos;s really going on .
now , i can &apos;t tell you about this , because i &apos;ve got to read on the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : what they don &apos;t know about marriage .
but how ?
it becomes even better . it turns out that we can create these <unk> , with the help of materials that are <unk> .
the animal <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> its wing , it <unk> this , but it doesn &apos;t really take the fly , because the fly between two <unk> .
for a intelligent creature like our fly , this rule is not in stone , but it changes as the animal is learning about experience .
in many of these experiments , we were able to be able to be able to <unk> the identity of the critic to 12 cells .
there are a couple of ideas in the <unk> and the artificial intelligence , as you could do that , but we still don &apos;t have a single example , like intelligent behavior of the physical interaction of life in living matter .
here &apos;s <unk> , or in fact , it &apos;s a <unk> .
ed : i &apos;m sure . <unk> : okay . a little bit of inside , a little bit more at the middle .
in your experience , i know that hospitals can be able to be a very dangerous place for young people .
here &apos;s a picture of my <unk> of the puzzle .
one thing i tell you is this kind of <unk> , this kind of <unk> , from their goals to their genes , will be the <unk> change that we &apos;re going to see in our lifetime in health care .
they don &apos;t go like a <unk> <unk> or <unk> , <unk> .
here we have the robot .
<unk> <unk> built the <unk> <unk> .
what would happen if you had to put on the bottom of the <unk> , and it would come up with a <unk> or we would shake the sheet ?
and so there &apos;s also <unk> . and he &apos;s doing this .
of course , it &apos;s completely different than you could see it in a <unk> .
we &apos;re going to look at the speed of land .
and i would say that people are working in the ocean and think about the goals , we &apos;re thinking that it should be much lower .
this is the ship that i had the last three months in antarctica .
if this ice goes down to the bottom of the country and a half meters .
what was the cause ?
in both cases , the bad news for the corals of the british islands .
you have the relationship of the water .
but then at the end of the end , you see the <unk> in black .
we &apos;ve got very interesting possibilities in the atmosphere in the atmosphere of millions of years that we &apos;ve been doing all this with <unk> , but in this case , we &apos;re going to go back 20 million years .
and this is the challenge that einstein asked , to figure out how the gravity works .
einstein had already done space and time , <unk> and curves to describe the gravity .
but deep in the structure of space , so the idea that there could be more dimensions than we see there are more dimensions than we see there .
and in the same way , as the <unk> of a mirror , they can be able to be able to be able to be able to get out in different patterns .
it &apos;s not .
is this only an interesting mathematical model that might be able to explain some of the <unk> properties of the world , or can we actually think of these extra dimensions ?
so , we have two of the <unk> points here with <unk> points .
now , can you see the predator , which is what &apos;s going on , is it ?
and what &apos;s true information is that it &apos;s based on all of the information .
and we &apos;re looking at 30 seconds , which is a little hammer , in a 18 minutes long talk .
why ? because if the <unk> in this shadow would actually be in the shadow , and the same amount of light on their eye , like the <unk> outside of the <unk> , they had to think more about -- just to the laws of physics .
what do you know ?
and it comes into the <unk> , you find a empty <unk> , and you &apos;re going to see -- and this is honey .
he finds him . <unk> , right ?
do you eat ? yes ?
often , there &apos;s no right here right now or wrong .
in new york , not so much .
we &apos;re also a species of the storyteller .
now some things : understanding of security , the risks , the <unk> , how they work .
but in a modern and complex world , they need models to understand the many risks that we &apos;re thinking about .
think about cancer , malaria , <unk> , sars .
there was no new insight , but less fear .
and there &apos;s a different cognitive movement : i call it <unk> , because we &apos;re able to accept data , to accept the data of our <unk> <unk> and data on our <unk> .
i &apos;m talking about a different group , if my plane was safe to fly with it .
this <unk> the people .
and he found here in the morning , in stanford .
they had good <unk> with their teachers , students .
let me ask you some questions about whether that &apos;s a good choice . &quot;
and i took someone else to get them to get them or save them , where i could get a <unk> , but i found that nobody was doing something .
we opened the first part of 2009 .
robert <unk> : a park in heaven
and groups were very often going to call terrorists &quot; terrorists . &quot;
they need a <unk> process , which is where the core of these very complicated society can do with its problems .
it &apos;s about that we probably have the first time in the history of the arab world of the arab world in the arab world .
and this is what &apos;s going to do is that the <unk> decade was so strong . and that &apos;s from a reason .
after once , the ngos are not only on the streets , not only on the streets -- but they took them into the <unk> , which is part , because they were the victims of this weapons .
thank you for your attention .
but i don &apos;t think that &quot; <unk> &quot; is something good .
so , this was completely dramatic .
it &apos;s a little crazy thing to work on a new <unk> .
and i &apos;m trying to use a very scientific approach .
they said , &quot; well , you know , this strange rich man in the film ?
it &apos;s a big tooth . &quot;
and at the last day , the sun comes out , they come out to the boat , and it &apos;s fantastic . it &apos;s fantastic .
i &apos;m going to show that i &apos;m a little bit nervous because i &apos;m going to tell you a couple of radical things about how we &apos;re going to think different about cancer , to a audience , many people there are a lot more people in cancer than i do that .
the part of the genome that we can read is the list of <unk> .
it turns out a huge amount of information in the genetics of genetics , by the way you &apos;re just going to use the genetic effect .
and i mean , &quot; okay . at least this guy is doing good . &quot;
that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do is measure every <unk> than a <unk> .
if you have malaria , we give them <unk> , or some <unk> of them .
what we really need to do is the process of the process that &apos;s going to happen , and that &apos;s on the level of <unk> activities on the level of why the body doesn &apos;t care about how it doesn &apos;t change it ?
budapest <unk> : cancer by ideo
they all are members of tribes in tribes .
it &apos;s not enough to give those people .
because on stage three , most of us are most of us .
this is their <unk> .
there was no plan . never before anybody tried something else .
in fact , martin luther king was <unk> sentence in stage three .
so i &apos;m sitting here in this chair and do nothing . &quot;
and suddenly , they took the <unk> out , and they tried to figure out , &quot; how do we wonder the population of africa ? &quot;
together , we <unk> the little bit of plastic to the top of plastic .
this is called <unk> <unk> , which was designed to be as much as a lot of <unk> to <unk> the <unk> for the floor that they are , not as a <unk> building .
they <unk> the stability and security who can offer the lap of a album , you put them with the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
but from my perspective , compassion has a problem .
and it &apos;s the <unk> form of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t really explain it , and he doesn &apos;t really explain it .
stories like this , <unk> like this , are unexpected aid in a world that &apos;s going to make compassion to make compassion , the <unk> of suffering of suffering that might be more <unk> .
gandhi was also a really <unk> human .
and at the first day , our <unk> <unk> , and we taught us our motto that we had to take every day for the rest of the summer for the rest of the summer .
this is one of two or three or three of their known .
here are some examples .
it turns out that we can &apos;t be part of a group , without <unk> the opinion of others .
so this is the world that we live today .
and so i &apos;m trying to learn from the example of my father to learn .
okay , number two : go into the wild .
and imagine this , you &apos;re going to make a full picture : i was born in a very small village in mexico , in fact , in a very small village in mexico , and my parents didn &apos;t have higher education .
and so we believe that through all the changes that are happening is that we &apos;re doing incredible opportunities today .
it &apos;s a initiative that &apos;s on simple , <unk> , <unk> solutions .
now , we &apos;ve got 30 different censorship , in 18 different countries , and we were able to connect millions of people to connect to learning what this particular map needs to learn and need to learn about what this particular map needs to do .
and i came up with my father , and i said , &quot; you know , i remember that every generation has to make it better than the age .
i know many people who are very smart , and yet , &quot; why can i &apos;t solve my problem ? &quot;
i started in 1980 with a different family .
don &apos;t you know that we have the responsibility to take the surroundings seriously ? &quot;
i &apos;m still going to go to the same four years of old ford as soon as before .
but this is not a good life .
this is what he <unk> .
whether you don &apos;t believe it or not , it doesn &apos;t make any difference .
so he said , &quot; what do you think in your hand ? &quot;
what &apos;s that in your hand ? &quot; -- i said , &quot; it &apos;s a <unk> , and this <unk> represents their identity , which is what they are .
when my children were a little bit small , i sat in her room , and i sat on her bed , and i looked at my kids to sleep .
it &apos;s less than i had <unk> -- i <unk> with three to 10 million -- but yet it &apos;s a very important number .
in a village , we have 100 laptops , every one with a different collection of 100 books , so that the village was suddenly 10 books .
right , the famous chinese characters , for <unk> .
they answer the question : how does it feel like you think that you &apos;re <unk> ?
we really learn this really bad lesson .
think about a moment of how it is to feel in right .
and unlike all other other animals , we &apos;re obsessed with it , trying to figure it out .
and i &apos;ve got to tell you that i thought i write this incredibly <unk> book about a theme that all hate , for a audience that would never give it .
the effect of that , of course , is not just <unk> wheat , but mountains of villages .
alice came from vietnam to america .
the answer was <unk> : &quot; this is even worse . &quot;
our <unk> was in a third of the <unk> in our industry , and in the five years of <unk> <unk> , we &apos;re <unk> our <unk> .
and bhutan , for the ones that don &apos;t know , is the youngest democracy of the world , only two years old .
it &apos;s actually so that we &apos;re often going to go to happiness as well as happiness as happiness as happiness , a thing that we need to make is a thing , or maybe several things that we need to get .
and we ask 10 simple questions -- that &apos;s the simplicity .
what we really need to learn as leaders is that we can change the <unk> of production by which we can change the right conditions , so our employees can live their employees .
bl : all right . one , two , three , three .
on water , you &apos;re going to tell you the <unk> , you move to you , but the eyes are going on with the boat with the boat , and say , &quot; i &apos;m quiet . &quot;
amy , are you going to go down ?
the method : what did you do ? the result : what do you see ?
i only read one .
<unk> scientific education should give people a voice , and it helps them to be able to express this , and therefore , amy , the last word is in this short story .
people don &apos;t have this possibility of choice .
we were <unk> in the &apos; 70s .
and over there , we have to see that the principle of a <unk> is not only the way that we &apos;ve talked about , but also our society <unk> .
today , 60 years later , i can tell you why it is possible .
i &apos;m sure somebody else told you , &quot; yes , great stuff down there -- but how do i come up there ?
i was professor at the <unk> <unk> system , and i got a lot of attention to that , and i had a lot of attention to fund the beginning of the program .
we have eight motors in this car .
thank you .
they get apart apart , they <unk> and they end up here .
i mean , people ask , whether mobile phones are safe .
you have a <unk> .
because , remember the original idea of dr. <unk> : the <unk> mobile phone of his wife .
and for those who don &apos;t read it : &quot; it seems like this , &quot; it seems like it was actually a kind of <unk> technology . &quot;
green or natural <unk> , who is not <unk> , is a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t care about the <unk> <unk> in our bodies .
first of all , a <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , who &apos;s called &quot; <unk> death <unk> . &quot;
only months later , i learned who he was really .
i &apos;m looking for a cure .
i say , &quot; think of it in life , if you can . &quot;
even with this <unk> paper in our hands , we &apos;ve done the hope that we &apos;ve done the hope .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
suddenly , he knows that he was written .
to give you this , we have to put them back on the wheel .
we <unk> the area , we <unk> it , we sent people in , we sent the building of inside , the <unk> , the <unk> , and we helped the first <unk> , in the heart of the heart , and the <unk> .
if i do this , i don &apos;t get the original details . in the opposite , i could write this story .
you &apos;re going to <unk> from the public opinion .
that &apos;s not very good .
and that &apos;s a democracy .
here &apos;s the question : what country is , what country might be better , china or india ?
because the indian man &apos;s living in things expectancy is a advantage of two years about the indian woman .
what political change , they &apos;ve done <unk> .
china , so i think there &apos;s still a couple of <unk> , <unk> <unk> -- especially in terms of social capital , public health health care , a sense of equality that there are not in india .
it was a place where people are <unk> , and with different <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and now you &apos;ve got the problem that they &apos;ve spent all the money to afford help with this <unk> electronics in these countries , and now it &apos;s all <unk> .
one of the <unk> environment , where probably a lot of ideas made , where people were more new , interesting , <unk> <unk> -- people have different ways .
about one or two decades ago , a wonderful <unk> <unk> with the names of howard <unk> , and i read darwin &apos;s notebook from this period .
she <unk> with her colleagues , but everybody said , &quot; no , i didn &apos;t think it was to do it .
is it also the other way ?
in the 1970s , this is a quarter percent of the national income in the united states in the united states .
many of these political factors can be <unk> in the category of &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , political <unk> that a group of good <unk> , but actually nothing for the rest of us .
and as you can see it &apos;s really easy to watch globalization and technological revolution , it &apos;s a lot harder , it &apos;s a lot harder to change all the time .
that &apos;s how they invest in the time and resources to create their children .
we &apos;ve created the modern <unk> .
this is his little hand .
on one of them , we &apos;re going to die all of them .
and this was a huge <unk> for us , because we didn &apos;t believe in a new development .
i think , even in places like oregon , where you have to take care of <unk> , and you can take a <unk> vaccine , only half a percent people ever had done it .
so , long talk about short sense : they came to canada .
but i was also heard of cancer as the most <unk> disease of our time , like , how did the good and bad together ?
now , i was going to be able to say so far , that <unk> is <unk> against cancer , and beyond it , not only against cancer , but it &apos;s about , not only against cancer .
twenty percent ! this is that there were these <unk> tumors , but only 16 percent of the real <unk> -- which <unk> that skeletal rain may be able to control angiogenesis , to control the tumors that these blood vessels are <unk> .
this is a very much <unk> idea , but i really believe that this is possible .
after that , i left my translator .
she was the girl who &apos;s going to be in the <unk> of the other for their team .
and at the same time , i wrote a letter to my best friends in atlanta , georgia who had a 11 years old .
&quot; what did he say ? &quot;
so the two came up to lunch , and we were <unk> from the restaurant .
he had children from the very korea of life , and he found families for them .
they have a lot of time about the dictionary .
so , i get the window out , look out , and see how <unk> from the side of the hotels in the bottom of the north hotels , the hotel .
so we went to the <unk> , and then they thought of our faces , and the kids were going to be in front of our faces and the children .
after the bottom of the adoption , a year ! what does this need to do ?
this is their <unk> .
this is german , which is about three days old , a couple of days old .
but there was no evidence .
there are little planets , there are bigger planets , there are big planets , okay .
but there &apos;s still a lot more .
so the question is : is this chemical phenomenon , or is it something that comes from the entire planet ?
and this deeper <unk> , the best thing is that the science is that the science is about how we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say , this is the size of the <unk> universe , with all the galaxies , with all of the galaxies , ok , from here after there .
thank you very much .
you see , in uganda , in uganda , and the <unk> , in fact , russia was in a percent .
they find the highest hiv thing on the world in african countries , and yet they find them in taiwan , here , the same is the same thing as in the united states .
look at kenya here .
it might be something else that &apos;s different , so that &apos;s how it &apos;s more important .
we know that about <unk> billion people ever lived .
it wasn &apos;t just a economic story .
and the result is even a bigger divergence in a less long time than it was in germany , and it was in germany .
it &apos;s how it &apos;s the institutions .
you &apos;ve got to pay me only to eat . &quot;
he was wrong .
well , i want to end with three questions about the future billion , just like , when the united states , they lose their place as a number of a economy in china .
no , we &apos;re going to be able to be able to use the huge <unk> that we &apos;re looking at , regardless of the sign that we &apos;ve lost our <unk> , and other parts of our historic <unk> .
<unk> , thank you .
there are many kinds of silk .
silk is almost completely <unk> from protein .
the fibers that can create a single spider , are already relatively diverse .
and also , <unk> has a lot of potential because of their ability to <unk> .
and what i want to do is don &apos;t want to be the <unk> , so nice you might be able to be , but on the photos .
you have to have a physical structure .
there are more photos . there are more photographers .
it doesn &apos;t sound in our ears , but what we &apos;re doing is that 80 percent of the <unk> <unk> has been a lot of <unk> .
the first thing that happens when you &apos;re a problem is that the first goal of the institution is that the first goal of the institution is that the ultimate goal is always <unk> .
the inventor don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the united states , the <unk> attempt to figure out whether <unk> journalists are or not .
it was designed by the <unk> , the use of many of these tools , the use of many of these tools , <unk> . hardly the <unk> of the world today , the same work in the last week .
you &apos;ve got <unk> , which is probably the <unk> part of the bread , or the fibers , because it &apos;s just full of fibers , because <unk> is from fibers .
everything is on his place . first level .
we call it &quot; <unk> . &quot;
but let &apos;s look at the various different steps , under the <unk> of the kind of connections to a deeper level -- my search is <unk> to the answer to the question , &quot; what &apos;s so special about bread ? &quot;
this is <unk> , two different things .
and if you &apos;re <unk> , you go back to prove that they &apos;re going to be in life and character .
if you make this bread , you can use any kind of <unk> by every beer .
it &apos;s going to be a kind of <unk> , while we &apos;re working through this talk .
it takes very , very long to write these ingredients , and at time , i &apos;m working on a piece that &apos;s 180 pages long , and this is a big part of my life and i <unk> my hair .
it &apos;s going to go from brian <unk> , which is a extraordinary artist .
these are a little <unk> of the piece of the piece .
so what we did -- odysseus <unk> , one of my students , and i -- we gave the babies two <unk> with food : a bowl with <unk> broccoli , and a magazine with <unk> <unk> .
i mean , i mean , at the end , when we look at babies , they &apos;re pretty impossible .
and our babies and children are much longer dependent on us than the babies of each other species .
the <unk> is to change the hypothesis .
now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
boy : this .
our consciousness about this thing is going to be extremely efficient and excited , and everything else will be like dark .
&quot; babies and little children are like the research and <unk> of the human species , &quot; the <unk> <unk> <unk> . their research shows how babies <unk> to play <unk> information and choices .
now , if i could just give you a little demonstration of a little demonstration to show the difference -- because it &apos;s actually quite <unk> .
and then you go back to this process , and they always come back to something , until something like that -- in this case , the character is like me to walk .
what we really wanted was the whole human body .
you can &apos;t do it yet .
here &apos;s a couple of simple scenes of how it &apos;s going to come .
i &apos;m not sure why , but we &apos;ve done it yet .
and we &apos;ve been able to use our software to do the same thing , and we &apos;re going to get a few of our <unk> , and we &apos;re going to see a few of our <unk> <unk> .
we thought he was just going to be the balance .
this is what you learn to go to <unk> -- like most of you know .
but i have to say , i &apos;ll never forget what happened when i was 13 years old .
i &apos;m convinced that art and creativity is really critical to develop empathy .
if you &apos;re the lonely , you write a new york times , and then they get hundreds of tears . most of what i &apos;m going to do today is <unk> from frustration .
some stories are easy , but it &apos;s kind of <unk> .
it <unk> . no one has ever bought it .
so there &apos;s a border that we don &apos;t want to stop . what &apos;s the solution ?
this is microsoft word , ok . if you want to make a new <unk> document in word -- that might be .
but i think it &apos;s actually two <unk> .
the other products were made by microsoft with a open signal , instead of <unk> <unk> .
and <unk> , when i write somebody &apos;s <unk> -- which happens every day -- i say , &quot; <unk> me . &quot;
but when i looked at the <unk> technologies , nanotechnology , <unk> and other in the hand of <unk> species of digital technologies , i made very big worried about the <unk> .
and to <unk> the danger of these new things , we have to end up the ability of the individuals that you find in principle , which is the principle of <unk> .
i think the challenge that we &apos;re here -- i &apos;m very sure that this is going to happen -- the challenge is : are we going to be able to do this <unk> with the background that we &apos;re going to use from this device ?
and if you create a three-dimensional structure , for example , <unk> , they have all sorts of incredible properties .
and to give you an impression of the last few of small to fund -- he <unk> on 400 million dollars , so that &apos;s very remarkable for us .
and if you create the concept of <unk> higher , you can see a lot of <unk> -- the <unk> of the market -- to use feedback .
12 years ago , hans years ago , when we began to me , and i &apos;ve done my research in this direction .
wonderful and <unk> things like this .
there are the ice under the surface .
so they &apos;re a <unk> life .
it &apos;s even as much energy for biology in this cave that there is actually a big number of <unk> .
we can see them .
we noticed a couple of years ago that caves have many properties that have been used by the people and other organisms that were used to be used .
even if you put a goal , you have to be able to get some steps to his <unk> , certain way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
and so it &apos;s also in yemen , the big greek mathematician .
<unk> were <unk> about it , and it was <unk> .
that means before we could begin to <unk> the <unk> , we had to take the book apart .
and this is what it looks like .
but by the streets with the speed of light around the light , they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
this was a bad idea , because <unk> from <unk> had a son called alexander &apos;s big , and they lost the battle of <unk> .
because in the moment of <unk> institutions , their data with <unk> and so much more .
the original <unk> of the bottle was one of the most <unk> <unk> of the 18th century .
i asked myself : 800 dollars for what ?
they &apos;ve got four <unk> .
a <unk> movement is that many of these things from japan are -- they &apos;re going to notice it .
i mean , a <unk> , <unk> toilet .
there was a object that i couldn &apos;t get in the fingers , and that was the <unk> <unk> .
and i can &apos;t -- we call my taste of a <unk> -- so it &apos;s not necessarily great that i was not impressed , but i wasn &apos;t the only there , with this reaction .
so at the beginning of this year , a virtual asteroid was sold for <unk> &apos;s real dollars .
the really interesting thing about <unk> , is that you can measure them .
well , i could develop a game with the names of <unk> by just a million and a thousand pies , or a thousand cake .
if there are real boxes , we can &apos;t do much better , but in a game , we say , &quot; ok . &quot;
this is absolutely critical and <unk> is really amazing .
and i want to tell you a short story , like , in 1999 -- there was a video game called <unk> .
it &apos;s about how <unk> forces can be transformed by the psychological and <unk> insights that we get when we see people see .
it &apos;s a kind of <unk> <unk> , which is called <unk> as <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> , and i &apos;m absolutely obsessed with diet .
there are all sorts of hunger in america , 3,000 million people and almost <unk> million children .
and their differences are also big .
it &apos;s the <unk> anniversary of <unk> , and the big <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> in america and the change of the way we have agriculture internationally .
this is a <unk> , which i &apos;ve got two years ago , and that was in one of the greatest projects that i have , and my company had ever been involved .
but i &apos;m going to take me on the beginning of the process of the process , to three very <unk> .
if we &apos;re so good at what we do , we shouldn &apos;t be able to create a architectural component that &apos;s totally able to create an architectural manifestation that absolutely <unk> and <unk> <unk> ?
it was <unk> , <unk> said , simple .
and this is the real <unk> of happiness .
the second technology that we &apos;re using , there are things that we &apos;re using things that you know about the <unk> of a opera .
here you can see the <unk> configuration .
i &apos;m going to talk today about how to get stories , in a sense .
one of these projects is about a year ago .
these are the images that they &apos;re going to be able to do .
as soon as i was sitting , i had the camera on the neck .
you can see a <unk> that shows you the exciting moments of history .
it &apos;s <unk> . well , again .
a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> .
a <unk> , <unk> farmer .
what if you thought about a year , the truth was , what would you do the next 35 years of your life ?
&quot; money and make a business , &quot; was the indian <unk> .
in the time , he had told them that he wanted to be doing it , and he had a little bit about <unk> .
don &apos;t tell me wrong , honey has absolutely benefits .
for the hand , it &apos;s almost impossible , except in <unk> , and then the communication is limited .
very funny people , if smallpox means that it means .
you don &apos;t do it .
if someone was seen by pennsylvania on a black board of 1993 , the <unk> would have been a little bit different since the time of &quot; love story , &quot; but he understood what was there .
i &apos;m talking about the <unk> , i wanted to say , if you &apos;re in new york , you can see my work next week with <unk> <unk> , and also in the <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
in fact , there is no evolutionary threat for global security .
and the same thing is true for the troops .
instead , there was a <unk> image of <unk> optimism .
crows are living in <unk> .
and finally , we have to understand that the secret of what we were in bosnia and in kosovo , the secret of our success , the secret of our success was a big part in our humility -- in the <unk> of our <unk> .
rory , they talked about motivation to end .
so here you see two examples .
this is an example of the same system , on a finger , to show you change what it looks like .
there are also <unk> , which is <unk> , but if you put these <unk> <unk> , this is going to be used for a different kind of <unk> .
the <unk> . this is a hard problem that i &apos;m not going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s another , very interesting connection , and this is that that &apos;s what you want to do is make valuable information further around a <unk> <unk> .
so , i think it has the <unk> food that we &apos;re probably going to be able to make things .
and we decided that we didn &apos;t have to think about it so much in terms of the cost of thinking , but in terms of simplicity .
there &apos;s a book that means , &quot; what &apos;s the <unk> of kansas ? &quot;
so we need to ask ourselves why .
but nonetheless , you don &apos;t use a lot of people who are not like to be like you .
so we can think of things like the <unk> .
i &apos;m like , but only half when i tell you that you &apos;re going to believe in the hospital , if you look at a <unk> , without the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
then bell said to his students .
within a couple of years in the late 19th century and early 20th century , suddenly the doctor was trying to ask a diagnosis , the <unk> .
from the perception of the patient , and the doctors in terms of the world &apos;s best in the best medical health care is a real <unk> .
and another experience that i did in texas before i went to stanford before i went to stanford .
the bad news : the right news , we don &apos;t know . look at it ? you can do it ? you can do that .
i remember so many huge , <unk> , <unk> eyes , who <unk> in this ritual to me .
some of us call us <unk> , a more <unk> term .
in this case , we &apos;ve got the <unk> .
for you there , here , here &apos;s : &quot; i was a miracle !
and there was no <unk> .
<unk> <unk> .
harder is to move the dead to a answer .
my friend simon <unk> , a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , wrote the book , &quot; the big bang , &quot; etc . &quot;
and now they open your eyes .
you can open it completely , and it &apos;s <unk> .
but it has been inspired to think about that these guys , at least most of the things that you know for their living .
all of the things that didn &apos;t do for that .
you can create a lot of change . you can build roads .
and that &apos;s something that &apos;s a little bit .
you don &apos;t need everyone .
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in venezuela didn &apos;t have invented it . he just took it out .
and so it &apos;s always going to go .
they connect people with each other .
the reason ? now , modern medicine uses a 60 years old method .
but there &apos;s another <unk> .
that &apos;s what it does is to get it faster , about 26 times cheaper , and over 400 times , <unk> than our <unk> <unk> for pancreatic cancer .
my experience with the islamic world is still different .
so there &apos;s the character <unk> .
and why are sex to babies , and why don &apos;t mean babies in relationships is an erotic disaster ?
because it &apos;s the secret of <unk> .
especially important about this description of the other , or my self -- this is the same -- especially interesting is that there is no <unk> in the desire .
this is their <unk> and <unk> , which is biology , the natural instinct .
so it starts the desire . this is what we need to think of curiosity , <unk> .
you know that there are a <unk> space that has heard every alone .
other places in the country had similar rooms .
in a <unk> cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
ok .
it &apos;s going to be played in smaller rooms .
so , early <unk> , some of them are <unk> .
so i asked myself , ok , is this a model for design , these <unk> that we &apos;re obsessed with ?
thank you very much .
and then he turned to me , and he said , &quot; i said , &quot; i mean , it &apos;s on me .
how do we solve the following three problems that i want to do here with language ?
my einstein einstein -- i was talking about somebody when i was talking in princeton , and i met mr. einstein , and i met mr. einstein .
what is it in life ? why am i here ?
i never read a speech or a talk or a lecture .
and it was about 300 people there .
he talked about his personal experience .
i said two years later , two centuries later : &quot; rare has been so powerful mind with so big <unk> of the authority of jesus hawking . &quot;
or he was what he said .
i &apos;m not going to be able to <unk> over the <unk> <unk> .
but you &apos;ve got to go about 10 minutes and give a woman in the arm that &apos;s not there .
i was never in .
<unk> <unk> , <unk> .
in tears in the eyes , i said , &quot; no . &quot;
eight : a young woman , president <unk> , and he says , how she and their siblings are living , their parents died in war .
we &apos;re going to go to rural areas and everything we do , as it happens in this room , we create a space .
i failed .
i want to look at 20 years from now , and you see that there &apos;s a <unk> girl , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> girls on this stage .
lg : i &apos;d like to happen .
<unk> realized , computers can do the ability to do things and make choices and choices .
every interaction will be <unk> by always more sensors : your telephone , your phantom , your computer . it &apos;s a lot of data , and we &apos;re going to get the opportunity to understand our food .
this <unk> was human <unk> .
by a <unk> process , what else is going to be made for 40 people about three months about three months ago , to a simple challenge for three people in 40 hours . that &apos;s all of the <unk> of the <unk> .
we should stop looking at it out .
and after dinner with my wife and the kids go home .
because people say , &quot; <unk> man , i don &apos;t have time to be <unk> . &quot;
she was a much bigger dog when i thought .
these implications are all of us .
the <unk> , the <unk> of the national <unk> <unk> to our problems .
think about <unk> , <unk> .
in the era of katrina , we &apos;ve got more together .
and they all have done that , and if you don &apos;t have to do it , you &apos;re going to have to do it .
let me make green <unk> to make the new black , help me to make sustainability sexy .
so i thought this would be a opportunity to use scratch to make a radical map for my mother .
but i &apos;m skeptical about what these <unk> <unk> .
in this case , you take a <unk> , put it on a rock , and you put it down to <unk> the behavior of different characters in a game or a story , in this case , in this case , the big fish .
if you learn to test , you can do with learning to learn .
when children are able to create these projects , they learn important concepts like variables , but that &apos;s just the beginning .
what i want to talk about today is to give you a background , is the idea that cars are art .
this is what i want to talk about .
and i think this thought that the great car is a soul , very useful . you all know that . you know , you see a car with the soul with the first one . you know how strong it is .
this is one of my <unk> , which is really called our relationship to cars .
right ? and they decided that it would be cheaper , instead of a <unk> and six or seven or seven and seven and seven and seven and seven and seven <unk> .
there was a lot of dialogue .
i think we felt very close to each other in this day , and we were going to be <unk> , and we <unk> the concept for the real creatures of true <unk> and creativity .
we didn &apos;t use him to boston .
and i only have a little laboratory .
now , we &apos;ve got the clinical trials in four <unk> of this disease .
we don &apos;t have a team of <unk> and <unk> , which we can do with these drugs on the market .
100 billion are the only number you need to know .
what you need to think is that we have to do it with a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , with the 100 billion stars .
what he didn &apos;t mention was why the entropy had ever been low .
in contrast to the low entropy of the early universe , although we don &apos;t know the answer to this , we have a good theory to explain if this theory is true , and that the theory of the dark energy .
and therefore , though the universe is going to go forever , and ordinary matter and radiation is going to be <unk> , always a certain amount of radiation of radiation , some <unk> fluctuations , even in the empty space .
but we also give big fluctuations .
it <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> fact of the universe that you accept and not wonder .
i had never used a computer .
it was a future that i couldn &apos;t accept .
now , i want to talk to all these things out there , like me , say , to the equations and the poor people with their dreams .
not what movement i did in my real world was only through my small device in the digital world , and eight years ago , in 2000 .
i took this very literally , i took my <unk> , and i put him a little <unk> , which was good <unk> .
the camera doesn &apos;t really understand my movements , but it &apos;s also possible to understand what things i mean in my hand .
and why only <unk> ? we can just play with condoms .
all of the work you &apos;ve seen is about my learning in india .
this is <unk> <unk> , king of spain .
this is going to be the <unk> park in rio from june this year .
again , you don &apos;t have to create deep under the earth to build this <unk> .
i &apos;ll give you a quick example here .
almost every year , we have this awful <unk> .
we &apos;re under the average <unk> in the city of <unk> in the city .
a city of the future is a city that none of these great community , which are cities .
the best answer is to try to try to try to make a darwin of the most powerful <unk> of our artistic and aesthetic preferences .
so , the trick of evolution is to make it beautiful , so that it &apos;s kind of a kind of movement <unk> , so it &apos;s <unk> to you , it &apos;s just going to look at it .
and some of them are in every case to use them to use the <unk> .
our strong reaction on images , to the expression of feelings in art , to beauty of music in the world , is going to be on us and our offspring , as long as the human conflict exists .
well , it &apos;s a pretty complicated system , but let me try to explain it , and maybe i can simplify it .
so , you can see what the computer is going to see the environment , and there you can &apos;t see it &apos;s not going to be able to look at the driver with red leds , and he really can see what &apos;s going on .
and you can see if mark it can avoid .
or for blind people , in everyday devices , in the household , in education and in the office .
so , a <unk> <unk> had begun to hear that normal people don &apos;t hear voices , and i heard them , he didn &apos;t know that something that could not be familiar with me .
now , i was <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and i was told by my professor , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , and i was told by my <unk> , &quot; eleanor , with cancer , is to protect cancer as schizophrenia . &quot;
so to <unk> <unk> : if the social change starts , it can &apos;t be more <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing now .
so what i &apos;m talking about is that it &apos;s where we should look for life , rather than mars , although mars is also a very much <unk> and interesting place .
and the ordinary astronomers were full of islam about it .
because it &apos;s <unk> that the kind of life can live there , it has enormous benefits compared to life on a planet .
there was still another thing , this <unk> <unk> of the creatures with creatures and <unk> and <unk> -- pretty <unk> stuff for a little kid .
the first projects was powerful , but they took technology , and they might be able to use technology , they might use the people on a new way , and maybe a new society would find .
the other thing , the <unk> is in <unk> , is that we decided that we decided that we decided to do the entire technical performance , this whole <unk> , and tried to do it as beautiful as possible .
so we called it down water . so this is another example that everything happens in a room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas of the brand , it &apos;s <unk> , it &apos;s full of each other .
this is my <unk> anthony , in switzerland , he had to get the laptop for a afternoon , i had to get it back with it . that was hard .
eric <unk> : the design of objects that tell stories
thank you .
my <unk> , a incredibly <unk> and brilliant woman , was early <unk> .
she was the <unk> <unk> for women that i &apos;ve ever heard .
so , you know , these young girls who come back to school , after <unk> in their faces .
the world who had been <unk> was a world in the war , was a world in the war .
then it &apos;s going to be able to die .
you need to negotiate .
it &apos;s the people from my generation that are living in a world where all of our <unk> , and in which some of our best conversations have happened on a screen .
in fact , it could mean that they could print their own medicine .
and if it tells them why that &apos;s interesting , it &apos;s interesting , you have to look at the rest of hong arabia because it &apos;s a country that &apos;s <unk> between the <unk> .
maybe some things are bad traditions and they need changes .
let me give you an example : in turkey , where i come from , which is a very <unk> republic , and we had a little bit about something that i should call the universities to protect the universities , against <unk> students .
now , if i was the only person who thinks , we would have a problem .
in the 19th century , when muslims have seen europe as example , they were <unk> , <unk> .
that &apos;s why the <unk> process , the efforts of turkey , the <unk> of turkey , in turkey , in turkey from the <unk> muslims , during some <unk> countries .
there &apos;s a very big nose , which is not <unk> , as they would be connected to something .
now , scientists today , a century later , a century later , you want to make neurons look , instead of the inside of it .
carl <unk> : statistics in the skin of our brain
but this trend is less clear .
but for many parts of africa , there &apos;s a colleague of mine , &quot; the <unk> on the tuesday was just <unk> at the right time , so the genocide was able to start in the right time that the genocide could start . &quot;
and instead of doing this opportunity , local leaders and international leaders are going to be <unk> , and they &apos;ve been <unk> by the second <unk> , the events of the <unk> , september 2001 , and in iraq .
design design requires a strong focus on the <unk> , <unk> thinking and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
the <unk> are the heroes of my story .
in a <unk> ocean , life has already been early at the same time , and this is where it was in more complex . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt . &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt .
<unk> traveled across continents . the big script began .
some of the mammals came back to the water .
every man should have the opportunity to be <unk> .
but there was nothing for this purpose , so we had married <unk> with prostate cancer , and then we &apos;ve created our motto , which is : &quot; the face of the man &apos;s head change . &quot;
mo <unk> from canada , from the united states , and from england <unk> us and <unk> , and he said , &quot; hey , there &apos;s nothing for cancer .
and i said , &quot; last year , we had happiness to have joshua <unk> . &quot;
so this kind of entertainment , men in the time , in every age , is so critical and important , and i think about so much more important than the money that we use .
he could see what his woods happened , because his home , because his grandfather took him under his <unk> when he was just two years old , and he started to teach him about the woods and the way of the lives of his people .
when i was thinking about that , i wonder what our grandchildren and our <unk> answer when they ask the same question .
we need new models to be a leader and human beings .
they work with people like <unk> <unk> .
a life long , through everything , about the cultural revolution , and all of what was going on , he was doing that he &apos;s about eight million pieces in his museum in his museum , the contemporary chinese story .
it &apos;s just going to happen .
&quot; my world is subjective .
or maybe he was just a <unk> who was sitting on a rocks and the sky , and the sun and the moon .
and if you &apos;ve lived a extraordinary life , you &apos;re going to get into <unk> , or how the french call it : the <unk> -- -- the sky of <unk> .
and this is how it comes to these great rituals in which big <unk> of the <unk> , and for 10 days .
you see , what is business because other than a result of the behavior of the market and the behavior of a organization ?
you see , this is india today . the <unk> of the reality is based on a <unk> .
you know , he created the biggest <unk> , it &apos;s called &quot; big <unk> . &quot;
&quot; why i &apos;ve met this way , why i &apos;m not interested in <unk> , i &apos;m just going to go , please . &quot;
<unk> <unk> takes us the eyes for a new look at the myths of india and the west -- and it shows why this <unk> systems in the <unk> , the <unk> of the death , and the <unk> of us to help us do .
but you know what ? it &apos;s almost 2012 and the world says , &quot; i &apos;m completely , absolutely . &quot;
it &apos;s interested in what &apos;s going on ?
their friends and family are going to go to the <unk> , and there , on your grave is going to be <unk> , which is called , &quot; here &apos;s a <unk> engineer , which is called <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re excited . this is the conversation that they want to hear , and fathers want to hear , because your child is good in mathematics and you know what &apos;s next .
this is because they know what they are . they know what they are .
i don &apos;t have patents , and i never get money from a medical <unk> , and i don &apos;t <unk> them to decide that they choose me .
so what do you know if your chest is full of high density ?
in fact , there &apos;s more <unk> to the result that the relationship of other technologies are <unk> , and it &apos;s not very <unk> .
if you look at a tumor , as long as it is less than one of a 16 , it &apos;s the <unk> <unk> in about 90 percent , but they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
the image of the <unk> shows this tumor , just like a second tumor , just like a second tumor , which is very much about the <unk> possibilities of the patient .
it costs a <unk> years of <unk> education to be a psychologist in this way to be able to be able to distinguish a normal <unk> detail of a <unk> .
some women who are going to get to breast cancer , many years later , and fortunately , most people survive .
so , there <unk> <unk> <unk> there , there <unk> <unk> there because there &apos;s a lot of power there . it &apos;s a lot of power .
we put this physicist in los <unk> to see what they &apos;re doing .
it &apos;s a lot of <unk> .
they &apos;ve met in that <unk> .
this is a <unk> vision .
it &apos;s a question of consequences .
so let &apos;s go back to the point .
what did i have done ? i heard my belly ?
that &apos;s interesting . this is a different way to think .
the <unk> is the principle of a human mind , where each of the <unk> is to the surface of the surface that it &apos;s going to be in the brain .
this is white noise .
and rob is probably going to be in your direction .
i just did that to make money .
thank you .
and he said to me after a long silence , &quot; i wonder , &quot; i wonder , whether people don &apos;t find your <unk> fascinating than my videos . &quot;
this is the reason that i &apos;m talking to david <unk> , a scientist from harvard , a object that has created the toxic elements with these plants .
no , not potatoes , but <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
the trend of other people can take easier than your own , and i want to get the <unk> mind of this conference .
bruce <unk> was like the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> version of <unk> for the <unk> .
he was a really interesting thing .
he went back to the second side and said , &quot; hey boys .
this is like mcdonald &apos;s .
let &apos;s think about other <unk> , where you can expect to expect a very much risk of risk .
the second reason was that the time was brilliant in marketing and was .
people talk about the <unk> -- that every game for two people have a <unk> .
<unk> is skydiving with a board on the feet .
<unk> on a high level like this is just possible , if you &apos;re looking at a step for a step , if you &apos;re really able to do something harder and it &apos;s working on it .
rd : no . that &apos;s only smoke .
and i want to do with scientists .
so , i had the hope that , by some natural elements , i had a little <unk> , a little <unk> , i could create the space .
in fact , it &apos;s called a difference , whether you don &apos;t do something or not .
the big mountains in the way they move out is less .
how do we create an idea that are both <unk> , and also to <unk> , without the two in two different directions ?
i was talking about new kinds of <unk> , one of the animals that <unk> animals , instead of <unk> it .
but again , the material was the material , which was <unk> .
they &apos;re going to take care of the dead .
at this time , he taught the video of the <unk> college in <unk> college .
natalie <unk> : old poems of life on life
<unk> than a dolphin is impossible .
as adults , when i &apos;ve been talking about the amazing insights of <unk> and <unk> , sue <unk> with <unk> and <unk> , <unk> <unk> and alex , the <unk> , heard of me .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> : like that .
we &apos;re in the national canyon , we &apos;re going to get to <unk> <unk> , for the research and <unk> .
but we found pretty quickly that we &apos;ve created a system that we had created a system that &apos;s going to connect to each other .
today , this is the first time you &apos;re talking about this issue .
this is a picture of me and my daughter on which we &apos;re in the israeli flag .
&quot; because it works , i &apos;m going to make a poster with me . &quot;
they came and it was so many . one day , i remember that <unk> with a journalist , and he said , &quot; who &apos;s going to see ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody &apos;s going to see ? &quot; and he said , &quot; everybody . &quot;
it &apos;s not the <unk> . this is not my side .
and sometimes war is <unk> . but sometimes , with a little job , we can avoid it .
and what we &apos;re going to do with &quot; <unk> is more , to try to think that the negative <unk> is almost always going to be <unk> . it &apos;s about who we are .
and we looked at this guy , <unk> .
and slowly , you start thinking that sustainable life is less fun than normal life .
so , at the pentagon , at the pentagon , at the time , they &apos;re going to get a <unk> wheel , and then you get a <unk> wheel , and we &apos;re going to go back to the other <unk> .
it was interesting because she was in the morning of nine to 11 to 11 , and how many billion they should invest in the <unk> of the economy .
this is a <unk> from switzerland . in switzerland , there is a national need for <unk> <unk> .
we &apos;re going to do little films often .
what i &apos;d like to talk about is these are the biggest problems in the world .
but , of course , it &apos;s a problem when you get people to focus on problems .
so what i think is really , really to say that we had a very long time , a situation that we had to have a situation where we had a number of choice .
and then you ask , why economists ?
but it says that what we can do about it is very little , too high cost .
the <unk> of malaria is a couple of millions of <unk> per year .
what happens here is that we think about our priorities .
it &apos;s a good film on the way that i want to see it is true , but not if you don &apos;t expect <unk> in his next film <unk> <unk> , like he &apos;s in tanzania , or so something like this .
they &apos;ve all had the same material , but they could be able to go to the <unk> of the discussion , and they &apos;ve done it safe to make their own videos .
it &apos;s the power to create wealth and greater freedom , is <unk> . &quot;
secondly , china was able to be able to get the <unk> percent higher , without going to change the political threat .
first house was found that , although 50 percent of all countries are 70 , 70 percent of them are <unk> , in the way that people don &apos;t have <unk> or <unk> .
because finally , the question is that , and seven billion other people on this planet : how can we create prosperity ?
the <unk> is not so right in your place .
we &apos;re going to do what &apos;s really interested in what &apos;s really interested .
it was published six months ago , and it &apos;s going to be published in germany .
you need to do a lot of growth of temperature .
i think it &apos;s easy for human skin of what i &apos;m fascinated with .
but i think it might be a really <unk> and sustainable relationship to our <unk> <unk> resources .
it &apos;s not going to be <unk> in factories , because of our <unk> demand for ipods .
it &apos;s because one person would spend their time to make a piece of something that doesn &apos;t mean that they &apos;re going to be to a piece of something .
john sister came up to him and said , &quot; some thing that &apos;s easy . you don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
this is the <unk> , and i was going to go to your family in the name of her family .
the taliban are going to do their own schools .
if any child comes out of these rules , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , it becomes hard .
if i look at <unk> , the kids are like me , or in my age , i feel so inspired by her <unk> .
and this is what &apos;s going to be there on enceladus , in fact , on enceladus , from <unk> , i hope to end up in the middle future , especially in the middle of this question .
is that the internet is actually a place that you can visit ?
and the landscape has changed . over three years ago , when i started to do this , there was only a wire on the african west coast of the west coast in this map of steve song as thin black line .
and that doesn &apos;t seem to me right .
so this data is going to take the pattern of layer on the device , starting with the basis of the product , and it shows the material layer of layer of building the new <unk> in a <unk> process on the old layer of the old layer .
it was made by <unk> from <unk> from about four <unk> .
it will be less likely to get less likely .
you can just create it right now .
this is going to be made the product .
without any doubt , i believe that this technology is a revolution in the production , and the <unk> of how we know it is going to change .
he was worried that when he called them in this name , especially , in the public , you could think he would think he would be <unk> from jihad .
they use his <unk> .
the good news is that it doesn &apos;t have to be that .
but many of these factors that have a role in fact , are still more stronger than more than half the work .
i was talking to my friend susan <unk> , the <unk> , in the <unk> valley .
she said , &quot; you know , poverty was not the bad thing . it was the <unk> and the <unk> of all the thing . &quot;
do you know , i &apos;m going to miss the violence or the drugs ?
first of all , instead of a half of months that &apos;s coming around and forgotten , the time was very much <unk> .
but it &apos;s less likely that they &apos;re going to stay .
and during my first year , i took my business .
it &apos;s going to be told that more energy is needed to make a solar cell than they &apos;re going to be able to make a solar system than they &apos;re going to use .
models , but a half hours of light , and then the light is a half of hours .
in fact , it &apos;s full of the pressure , and so dangerous .
this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s just a small cylinder on the bottom , which is the <unk> , and all the <unk> , and this is the hot <unk> , the hot cylinder on the upper end -- this part is going to be cold , and it comes out electricity .
you don &apos;t have to use the hot water , it can also <unk> .
so here we have a map of the united states .
and we don &apos;t have the <unk> to use this energy so quickly , as we &apos;re doing it in the moment .
we put it down and look at the parts .
it &apos;s a cloud laboratory with which we did the measurements in the region of this molecule .
but i wrote bad poetry , and he was never written the <unk> in the air , but he was sent to cuba .
so , from <unk> can be great stuff -- -- that i &apos;m going to get a picture , and then finally , i &apos;m going to get a picture that finally is going to land in my work .
i work for the new york , and i &apos;m doing <unk> , and then 9 / 11 , and that was , um , a <unk> end of the world as we knew it .
and then the <unk> , &quot; <unk> , <unk> ! is <unk> with the tongue , but that &apos;s how we understand it . &quot;
&quot; and he decided he had to be extinct . &quot;
this man is angry , because somebody else on his staircase <unk> , and basically , you know -- you know , <unk> seem to be a theme .
and it &apos;s also about george <unk> , so i don &apos;t think it &apos;s not .
in fact , since my youngest childhood , and after my youngest childhood , i had a lot of different <unk> , and when i was young , it was always like that my way was <unk> .
this is beautiful , but we should remind us that a similar process is also supposed to be able to be able to make a different process .
rg : <unk> has worked incredibly hard , even for my invitation , let &apos;s go through everything that &apos;s happening , and i was sometimes pretty <unk> , and i was still a <unk> , and i was very nervous during this whole week , and i was very nervous during this whole week .
in those two examples of these two examples , we &apos;ve learned machines that have learned in the simulation , and other things that they &apos;ve learned in reality .
if i say , &quot; we , i mean , i mean the advice for <unk> .
but no one believes it &apos;s actually very effective , if there &apos;s a real ingredient .
the biggest part of the time in the <unk> of bush , is actually more , in connection with <unk> and the threat through <unk> .
we know that the virus is going to be <unk> . it will be a different virus .
but in the scientific community , there &apos;s a <unk> debate about what percentage of the <unk> between people between people through <unk> and <unk> , and how much about the hands happened .
some of the rich countries that most experiences in the most experience with <unk> , have the <unk> of drugs that are already taken .
and i think even our leaders would say in this case that we have to do very much better .
i &apos;m happy to answer their questions .
our world for <unk> , one of them developed tests -- as beautiful <unk> .
and in the other time , in humans , in the people , there are similar equations , also not a problem .
you don &apos;t just think about how much fun you have , but also , as the <unk> , it doesn &apos;t change the way to interact with a city like san francisco .
please put it up with me a <unk> .
i <unk> me with a boy <unk> from a <unk> , and he <unk> one to sell me three <unk> .
so since my childhood , i was sitting with <unk> and <unk> , the case is done . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m going to get a <unk> .
bangladesh is not in the lips .
so i &apos;m not going to <unk> , right ?
i stay in the middle of the middle .
she became one , he was sent me to the golden .
because of the <unk> leaves and rocks , it &apos;s very dark , and very quiet .
i &apos;m interested in my colleague of <unk> interest for the dynamics of the <unk> , which is in the woods of life .
we teach us with the media about <unk> ; we have a <unk> . we have <unk> .
and then the students came into our <unk> , and they &apos;ve taken their own <unk> with their own <unk> .
and our new project is that the ancestor , and we learn to grow the frog <unk> <unk> , which is a very much part of <unk> <unk> in the states in washington and oregon .
he said , &quot; look at what you &apos;re in front of you . &quot;
so we see a <unk> demand , and therefore , this is why we see a <unk> demand .
they &apos;re not a magician . they &apos;re not our parents .
you &apos;ve got to believe that . trust me .
that day i learned two really important things .
the deeper we go under water , the higher is the pressure .
so i began about 15 years ago .
in the <unk> , the air is in the <unk> , the air comes out of the air from the <unk> .
every one of these computers can do the entire system , so if two of them are there , there &apos;s still <unk> .
but this is what it looks like , and this is going to be <unk> , over a lot of miles .
so , they &apos;re not quite as dangerous as most people you &apos;re talking about .
now , when we found him , we didn &apos;t even even think of what family was , so we called it <unk> , so we called it <unk> , because he looked like he looked like he was from one of his books .
it &apos;s called a <unk> , and he <unk> .
this means that every one of you and every one of you here have heard about a child , which is a <unk> .
and his communication and social interaction and social interaction is so <unk> that he could go to a normal school , and even a <unk> .
it &apos;s so something like life : if you &apos;re only in it , you don &apos;t get back to it .
i know you never heard about him , but i &apos;m showing you this day , one day , you &apos;re going to hear you heard about him , because he &apos;s a fascinating man . &quot;
ts : no , it &apos;s been before 25 years ago .
he had a lot of love about every lot of love , he loved everyone .
we , all of us , are that what happens when a <unk> of hydrogen and helium is so much <unk> that they &apos;re starting to ask about their origins to wonder about their origins .
this <unk> shows that life can exist in many other environments .
so , you have to learn the diversity and the incredible scale of life on this planet in the first step , in the first step in the world with life in the world .
it &apos;s as important as <unk> , and we &apos;re going to be able to be able to produce it by 350 <unk> , so it &apos;s <unk> , and that moore &apos;s natural law of <unk> computing .
and then we would like to try to look at the <unk> of human <unk> .
many people say it &apos;s the best place in the world to explore the development of climate change .
every cylinder is a <unk> of time .
while they <unk> with the ice , they <unk> a few cameras in a oven , so they &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to get a new <unk> , if your <unk> <unk> and their fingers are <unk> .
i think this is a little bit <unk> .
and our soldiers don &apos;t look at all of the time to get <unk> in <unk> , if they were in the service of the service , to <unk> american <unk> .
you can get it further , and efficiency is almost <unk> with some <unk> improvements , and that &apos;s the <unk> of the big <unk> .
we could build bigger cars , which would allow for security , but it &apos;s easy to be doing it .
but instead , they sell it to china and japan , because we don &apos;t have the protection of our <unk> <unk> , and we don &apos;t have the other .
and that &apos;s because of the time , the step on the <unk> of this kind of materials , or in this case , to create <unk> <unk> , as well as good <unk> ; the <unk> can create the same way that it &apos;s done to the internet .
it can &apos;t be just about a massive <unk> <unk> <unk> .
there was two types of negative <unk> that we have to get .
what we &apos;re doing is that it &apos;s really stable .
no , i &apos;m wrong .
so , at the end , he found a <unk> , a student <unk> called <unk> van <unk> , who had a wonderful documents sold to a price , which is about 10 million dollars .
he looked at his <unk> , &quot; he said , as if he was discovered for the first time that there was bad in the world . &quot;
&quot; it comes on . what is it ? &quot; is a good answer .
but how attractive they find them , how much they move them through or <unk> , depends on what they think they &apos;re looking at .
but every one of these three objects has a value beyond what it takes to be , because of his story .
but i don &apos;t want a copy , even if i can &apos;t see the difference .
so joshua bell , he took him to put his <unk> with a beach in washington d.c. to take a corner in washington , to see how much money it &apos;s going to take .
the second shock doesn &apos;t seem to be less , because you &apos;re going to be used a little bit of it .
and if you <unk> , you can see that there may be a kind of political <unk> .
they <unk> that they &apos;re a <unk> , <unk> member of the american <unk> of <unk> , which is very glamorous , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
and what you find is , of course , people who have the vegetables and jupiter food , fewer <unk> .
the <unk> is one of the most amazing things in the entire world of medicine .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , if you take a drug in such a high channel that there will be more side side , and that you &apos;re going to be able to look at this new drug .
the big trials are closer to the real answer .
this is a problem for that we &apos;re not going to have a solution .
and , very soon , they started to get these coal <unk> , full of <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , to china and everywhere in the world .
can you imagine how to feel if you were in my place ?
it &apos;s just about oil ; you know , all knowledge that you know .
there is this thing , the <unk> of the world , and that &apos;s right from the middle of the united states .
and what do you see ? they are christians .
one , the americans , are kind of like , &quot; ah , <unk> .
these christians are <unk> .
they &apos;re <unk> . that &apos;s wrong .
and the soldiers are chinese , and all other other are chinese .
can you imagine that maybe one of you sitting on the morning , and it &apos;s <unk> , and he said , &quot; oh , i &apos;m coming back .
everything has changed .
and all this has created enormous effects on the world .
i think thomas jefferson didn &apos;t have it very good in words .
for the <unk> of the audience in the audience , it &apos;s like to explain why <unk> has a bigger budget as <unk> , and that &apos;s because it &apos;s <unk> easier in other languages and cultures , and so the market for these films are bigger .
but it will happen within this century .
this is not the <unk> of the united states , which is about a million , but the gdp of the world per head -- 200,000 dollars .
also , as everybody here knows -- it &apos;s about energy , not oil .
my choice is the peak of a <unk> <unk> , which is in the middle of the middle of the gulf of the gulf of the <unk> .
a lot of our actions on this planet , which is about our living environment , are only because of faith and wrong .
one has been for thousands of years of thousands or millions of years ago .
we need to calm down before we forgot the planet .
<unk> <unk> : <unk> wilson on earth &apos;s life on earth
another <unk> is the famous european <unk> .
the genome of the <unk> is 1.3 billion <unk> .
the <unk> of discovery is in this category .
real <unk> from a slightly <unk> boy .
there &apos;s a program to <unk> , which is just brilliant .
this is a emotional theme . some people came up .
my grandmother was a <unk> .
i also made my own comics , which was a different way to tell stories about words and through images .
and we &apos;re sitting on that , in silence , and he said to me , &quot; you &apos;re really <unk> . &quot;
use your own style . don &apos;t draw how to tell you .
&quot; don &apos;t <unk> , i have to get your <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m also going to leave a month with the title , &quot; <unk> mom <unk> : the <unk> who <unk> the <unk> . &quot;
the power is changing us all the time , <unk> , institutional and <unk> .
this is a 32 million pounds , <unk> <unk> , which was actually built in england in england , designed by a british <unk> .
but it &apos;s not only children who are affected by it .
people who tell the team doesn &apos;t sit next to this team because the noise like the noise and the other joke .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; a story about zero , a <unk> <unk> , which is going to be in the hands of the <unk> , and that &apos;s between the dream and reality and reality , and not in the way to <unk> both of the time .
<unk> <unk> and a half years ago , and a half years later , that was what we started as <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
i know that the theater is connected .
now , the time that we can use the diversity of our talents to create a intelligent , powerful and extraordinary work .
if you look at the sky , you can see some products more , like <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , but also <unk> .
<unk> <unk> -- or , since the &apos; 70s , <unk> of pigs -- will be used to <unk> it in fold .
so , i &apos;ve found <unk> products .
and i said , &quot; my love , i &apos;m afraid you &apos;ve got a long and <unk> year before you . &quot;
i told them , they should be <unk> , &quot; i &apos;m somebody .
they &apos;ve been told me to be somebody in a time , in a time where i felt like nobody felt .
they &apos;re going to work on the coast of the university , so they started <unk> , and they &apos;re going to get the letters on the table .
hundreds of fiction can be as behavior .
you can see this as the language of thinking , or &quot; <unk> . &quot;
so the puzzle is , why <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> are so often <unk> ?
you can try to imagine what &apos;s probably going to be used when language could only be used .
and the other puzzle is that i don &apos;t have a problem with this .
here &apos;s my argument . is it harder ? is it good ?
it makes it <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
what insight out they won &apos;t convince me to convince me ?
all of these different things . can you imagine a argument that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to look at , but in the audience , and you &apos;re sitting in the audience ?
or -- and this is the <unk> part of me : we want you in the world of nature , we &apos;re going to bring us into the world of nature , and we get a <unk> and find the <unk> of the <unk> in nature that could inspire us .
it changed everything . from there , these engineers were not <unk> in the boat .
here &apos;s the opposite -- here &apos;s how we create things .
this is the <unk> national laboratory .
that would be <unk> for fuel , if you could be able to get rid of <unk> .
that &apos;s not easy , because life is only going to use a result of the elements of the elements in the <unk> .
feel and react : feedback is very important .
what you don &apos;t see , you can &apos;t count .
my first business was a <unk> . i began under the taliban .
in south korea , indonesia are almost half a million companies .
because , like , like the <unk> , smaller <unk> in the same context , <unk> <unk> in the same context .
and in all the world , there are no exceptions .
people <unk> whether this <unk> and this miracle .
i &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , even <unk> cows on my <unk> <unk> , and i &apos;d like to use a blog , to <unk> it .
first of all , we &apos;ve taken it .
what does that mean ?
and when i started to start with them , i realized that they have been incredibly good .
but the researchers had a problem .
and after finally , they made their <unk> and the campus -- and certainly happy to come out there -- a couple of time later came back to come back and noticed that the crows are still trying to get it out .
we &apos;ve found that they &apos;re really smart and that they can teach each other things .
<unk> , for example , would come back to the light and go back .
but there was three problems , three puzzles that i couldn &apos;t solve , and i want to talk about , but more importantly , i &apos;ve found a <unk> .
who would ever write me ? &quot;
and imagine what could happen , because every region has to offer something .
let me create the connection .
you know that there &apos;s the <unk> of the future . you have to understand that .
this is a lot of <unk> .
oh yeah , i &apos;m going to be the johnny <unk> of sound .
about 10 million <unk> .
and here we can see , with the words of <unk> israel <unk> , &quot; how the hand of the penis in a kind of a kind of a way to do that . &quot;
and she said , &quot; yes , but i &apos;d like to get to the end , if you don &apos;t have to have this . &quot;
i said , &quot; you should do a experiment .
he had a line in his book in his book , who was <unk> from the <unk> , and there was a <unk> joseph <unk> who had trouble with morality .
so now you &apos;ve got an evolutionary excuse .
she said -- i have to read what she said , because i think it &apos;s so beautiful .
i think it &apos;s very radical . not because i want to use him . i wanted to see him .
and that &apos;s actually the beginning of our story .
now , i would have thought about this moment that in the age of 50 , one of the skills that i really had was , was to <unk> my shoes .
first of all , i have to tell you that i &apos;m not here .
yeah . the artists don &apos;t seem to know exactly where he &apos;s going to do the different colors .
but i can see in your faces that they &apos;re still a little bit skeptical .
it &apos;s called &quot; <unk> , &quot; and i think that &apos;s <unk> .
after a long time , i decided to have a little fun , and before i left the room in the morning , i <unk> a couple of things in the room .
and now you &apos;re all in here .
my father was one , my youth , so i was doing interesting .
the song as a mere fact .
and i &apos;m like , &quot; moment , is it really good , -- i &apos;m going to put the wheels down , and i put them down the <unk> bed , and i built them and -- look at it . could i get my <unk> ? &quot;
it just sounds like , but i believe that we &apos;re in china in our society and culture with the <unk> .
he had designed the <unk> self , and he was really proud of it .
people , i love this thing .
the consequences of a planet that has already been seven billion people .
and it was very proud of it , he was on the <unk> seat , which he had had a lot <unk> , which he had had had had had been published , and the beautiful <unk> about the seat around the seat .
<unk> -- a life with intent -- learned that the original thing , the original thing .
i saw the healthy mass of one left , and i <unk> that she was lost , <unk> all of what i didn &apos;t have done , but not possible .
then i started thinking about how many times before my life would have been different , if this man was different , if this man didn &apos;t expect me , if my genes had a different component of experience .
i was , but i was , despite a <unk> , i was thinking , and that &apos;s how i think i was thinking about myself .
and i had a lot of simpler <unk> : this <unk> <unk> against four words , and to give me back to my way .
he spent six months in jail , lost his <unk> for a decade .
yes , contrast .
we &apos;re working with the machine <unk> laboratory in the university of california , san diego in the university of california .
first , the perception of people . and second , a natural interface , an natural shape of electricity , so that the interaction with the robot will be more effective .
and yet , i made this idea too .
after i found this economic danger , i thought we need to find a solution for this problem .
some of the people who have been able to be able to talk like nathan <unk> is to talk about nathan <unk> , or the only one of tim <unk> that they would expect .
i don &apos;t know a tedtalk that &apos;s made .
this time i took 25 cents , because i found the challenge was something harder .
and yet , there was one of the things that &apos;s all happened : the dilemma had to be slow down .
keep the mystery of the dark energy in the back , because i &apos;m going to call you three <unk> to string theory .
the <unk> <unk> came to about 10 to 500 .
and he was working for decades about this number , but he didn &apos;t have a success , and we know why .
each of these universes have extra extra dimensions .
because the <unk> of today , it &apos;s powerful telescopes to follow the sky , to discover a handful of <unk> <unk> -- a kind of <unk> <unk> , billions of years .
well , i want to be honest with you and tell you that the most of it is just a trick , but a trick that actually works .
think about it , it &apos;s the first time you meet him . we want to think of it , and we really want to do anything else .
he said , &quot; sit , milo . <unk> them . &quot;
pm : this is so right in <unk> .
we don &apos;t know here .
at the next moment , the telephone is not going to be more , the tv goes out , <unk> men are on the street there .
it was a very <unk> meeting who had been working in the war , the collaborator of aid , and of course , the <unk> , <unk> people from <unk> itself .
if i &apos;m going to ask , why i &apos;m going to go to <unk> , why i &apos;m going to stay on it , that &apos;s the reason .
but it &apos;s my profession , and this is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> , the core of the thing , for us .
even before a goal , it seems to be a goal with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> trying to find the goal , whether it &apos;s the way it is .
in fact , we use the animals , so they learned to control these <unk> and objects in the virtual world .
in a experiment that we made a couple of years ago , we went to the car .
so we start in china .
and so he was going to be done by <unk> <unk> .
raise your hand .
the last reason to do this is that women &apos;s part of the solution , not the problem .
in <unk> dies , one of seven women died in the birth of a child .
it was part of the solution , not the problem .
larry <unk> , when he said , as the <unk> of the world bank , said , &quot; it can be good that investments in the education of girls in the developing world , the highest <unk> . &quot;
this is bill <unk> &apos;s book .
and that was the <unk> of a bird .
this whole <unk> about a single one of our <unk> tells us that there is a <unk> .
and even this image makes the <unk> sense of being <unk> -- like something from the <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> <unk> .
one of these ways was that we could have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do .
they put their <unk> , and they say , &quot; i want to use this <unk> to work , and we share 50 to america . &quot; we share 50 . &quot;
there are places on this island where you can all meet three or four kilometers on a new language .
when 27 individuals from these 27 people from these 27 days , their 23 languages <unk> , and then you &apos;re going to tell you a moment that they &apos;re going to need to have a army of <unk> <unk> to all of the <unk> possibilities .
but it doesn &apos;t tell us that they were also talking about language .
and what i &apos;ve been interested in most about is the invisible space between a text and the <unk> image , and how the image is changing by the text , and the text of the picture .
this is <unk> <unk> , which is about the bottom of the atlantic ocean and north america with europe .
they &apos;re going to get the <unk> .
but through the impression of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> can change the <unk> .
larry <unk> , eight years ago , eight years ago , in the <unk> , in arizona , for <unk> and <unk> <unk> of a <unk> boy on a <unk> <unk> .
before , people are going to leave themselves .
and they took them to texas .
and now they &apos;re going to go with the <unk> where they &apos;re in this moment .
it &apos;s just the <unk> of the nature that &apos;s going to look like nothing else .
this is what you call for a sense of a sense : the pursuit of happiness and human design .
in fact , this is the <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , which is the pursuit of happiness for <unk> , it &apos;s going to be made by <unk> parts of the individual , and could not be found in reality .
a <unk> in the science of happiness is that happiness and <unk> doesn &apos;t have <unk> in a <unk> .
it starts in <unk> <unk> .
this is a three weeks ago .
in the animal kingdom , there &apos;s only a way to increase the status , which is the <unk> .
i want to close with some <unk> .
why should you choose rats ?
once the rat has understood , we make the challenge a little bit .
you can actually cure them , even in humans who are hiv-positive .
to know that a patient , the <unk> is going to be infected to 15 people -- 15 healthy people -- per year , you can be sure that we have saved many lives .
here we see neurons .
so it &apos;s important for imitation and <unk> .
now , the question is : if i just look at a different person like a different person , why am i not confused , and i &apos;ve literally got this <unk> from the cost of the <unk> , how someone is going to touch ?
thank you . i &apos;ve got two crows here today .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s not about the <unk> , but it &apos;s about pollen itself .
all these images were made by a <unk> , by the way in the lab of <unk> .
even every single one of us has to tell a own story of the <unk> on us .
we need to be so good like the <unk> to deal with this crisis .
and at the time , in the 1980s , when we looked at women and death through heart disease , she was going to come back to the new england institute of medicine , and he called the <unk> .
our colleagues in washington , d.c.
we decided , &quot; let &apos;s look at this . &quot;
in contrast to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , for women , their <unk> <unk> , every time we create something that &apos;s just a little lot of radiation that &apos;s just a little lot of radiation , let &apos;s ask , &quot; is this test ? &quot;
okay , here we started .
they &apos;ve done what they said , they &apos;ve been <unk> , and they were <unk> .
the cells have a little bit like <unk> ; in the <unk> , they don &apos;t feel <unk> .
what does that mean for us ?
and in the course of three years , we took eight to 10 hours ago , about a <unk> hours of <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
this is one of the first <unk> , which is a little bit more than a year ago , which really surprised us .
and at the end of my son , my son is in a <unk> .
three of the most important people in this project was <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> roy <unk> here .
and there &apos;s a fascinating dynamic in the game .
this is the first time that our son was more than two steps on once -- on the film .
and this is an important thing to do . because the better thing we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better thing that we can communicate , and i think , the better thing we can think about and work .
it &apos;s a kind of center where you see a picture , and you think , &quot; oh ! i &apos;ve got a strong or emotional response to the thing . &quot;
what we &apos;re literally doing is to get our team <unk> the entire <unk> on a big wall .
this is the first house i built .
it &apos;s not only about <unk> , but it &apos;s also about <unk> .
so it doesn &apos;t make it .
if you put it into the building , if you have a <unk> , and a window is broken , you say , &quot; oh no , this is broken , it &apos;s got to be <unk> .
that &apos;s the difference .
so we &apos;re going to <unk> .
are we just just stupid ?
you can <unk> it in two years , if you read eight hours a day .
that you can <unk> in september , and say , &quot; i &apos;m important today .
why don &apos;t you do that , and why don &apos;t you do that ? &quot;
and the police <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> to get the car in pieces to get the body of the audience .
and this leads to the present to the present in the united states in the united states , which is a eye of the <unk> <unk> .
all of this leads to -- <unk> , just to say that what we &apos;re most about is to use digital devices .
this is the consequence of the destruction of more than a third of the brain on the right side of the right side of the <unk> .
this is a very , very high level to become from the health care of health care .
and he said to my cave in the right position when he <unk> my teeth in the right position .
robert husband is a brilliant physicist , <unk> , who &apos;s fascinated by that , in the consciousness , whether it &apos;s <unk> the <unk> , or an old thing that you see , or a french thing , or <unk> the movement , or a <unk> of the movement .
now , i had to be in the dark years , which was to figure out what happened to me when all of the things that happened today was gone .
and it works . it works .
<unk> : if you have the opportunity , you spend time with simon .
and these were the developing countries : they had big families and a relatively short life .
and those are here on this side . a big <unk> of africa and the world .
and then bandura came up and brought money to china , and i took the country back to one .
one of the things that we can do with the data in a <unk> form can copy the data in the world , and what do we hear if we &apos;re looking at us ?
but this is that it creates hypotheses .
you know , darwin has explained the life after it was made , what was the essence of life ?
and then i learned francis crick .
however , there was what was in the literature .
we were not the best chemist in the room .
i was lucky ; my girl didn &apos;t kill me .
so , you can actually compare to the dna of <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
and so , i &apos;m going to look at this by me that we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
by the way , the retina costs in a case of two million dollars , and it takes 18 months when they win .
first of all , they don &apos;t stop the patent to the patent , but against the <unk> .
my solution : give me this patent , and i &apos;m going to do it with <unk> .
&quot; why not ? &quot; i asked girls .
the fathers were in a place where they get their daughters to play their daughters to play their chairs and <unk> their hand to dance .
that &apos;s a great technology .
it &apos;s not very much in the world .
it can &apos;t survive for a long time in humans .
if you don &apos;t see the enemy of the time , and then we needed a different approach to do polio than we were able to do it with smallpox .
it has helped to control <unk> <unk> , sars for example .
the reality of polio today is something different .
and yet , the impossible is happening .
bill gates : now bruce , where are the most fundamental places of your view ?
bruce <unk> : how we &apos;re going to get polio <unk>
dj : we found this <unk> now on all kinds of animals , especially in the <unk> .
and in our surprise , it was a <unk> .
so for us , this elephant in many ways has become a symbol of inspiration , a symbol of this hope that we &apos;re doing in our work .
it was incredibly amazing than she took it into security to protect it from the <unk> .
and of course , when i look at this <unk> , the <unk> , it reminds me about a human hand , and this is <unk> , because your fate is in our hand .
we need it . we &apos;re trying to celebrate each other as a man and woman , as part of this planet and a part of this planet , and we need to go forward .
in fact , it seems to be obvious that the earth &apos;s big and <unk> , the sun is small and <unk> , but it &apos;s true to remember what <unk> <unk> is .
and that &apos;s because in the middle world , we &apos;re always there .
the nature of this model depends on what kind of animal we are .
because there &apos;s so many of them , and because of between you , there &apos;s no <unk> , in the <unk> , <unk> of the <unk> , as we see it in the middle of the world , <unk> and <unk> .
people like machines like the machines like science and <unk> right , but it &apos;s a <unk> time , if you want to think about what i &apos;m going to do next .
in night , i got to <unk> <unk> in the <unk> age of 40 years .
on a <unk> , i &apos;m going to give my head with my head , give me this <unk> to see videos of robots to see the robot , and i &apos;m going to send it into a <unk> .
with the help of people like you can do this dream .
for example , we &apos;re going to develop a <unk> version of the <unk> of the <unk> , which is essentially the <unk> that <unk> the dolphins , <unk> .
i think together , we can produce a global community .
this is a hot <unk> <unk> .
now there are some things -- there are some lessons that you can learn from it .
but usually we &apos;re not doing this .
i think we tend to look at this : the infrastructure of globalization .
this is now about 12 to 15 percent .
this is a problem that we need to solve .
and i also suppose that most of you don &apos;t talk to the chinese -- which is really sad if you think that this is the most important language in the internet .
what do you look at ? maybe we should do that .
if you look at this picture , you might think , &quot; why should me think about it ? &quot;
but there are all these different techniques that allow it to be able to look at and look at the world and to look at it .
they would get wealth and security , religious violence , and make sure that states are never going to <unk> hydrogen <unk> .
and one part of this activity is <unk> .
what is that ?
i love this court .
and the war of the war who took 20 million people had the lives -- until today , the <unk> war in the world .
<unk> <unk> , who is this guy : &quot; i &apos;ve got all this money , but i &apos;ve spent all this time to try to look at the american man who was my recipe .
big restaurants have seen the same thing , i would argue , with the <unk> , and the <unk> -- even the restaurant , but it &apos;s the restaurant , but without a <unk> island .
in contrast , we have general <unk> chicken , which was in fact in new york city in the early 1970s , when i started at the university in new york city , in the early 1970s , in the early 1970s .
so what we see in the 17th century is the <unk> search for medicine by <unk> <unk> , which is the same thing .
so the people would have a really big <unk> .
when the <unk> began to be less , i was just <unk> , and i just thought i was like , my god , i can &apos;t work better .
do you think about that as a child in any line ?
after 18 and 19 , i met the night .
soon again , i &apos;m going to be proud of depressed and a little <unk> .
many of us is clear that there are a lot to do in the next years to do a better world .
he goes around , &quot; how does it feel to be free ? &quot;
you know . where worked the world in the treatment of the most famous issues that we &apos;ve done from the potential of <unk> and climate change ?
if you put the impossible <unk> , you can do it possible .
but we have a form of climate change .
and there was god .
the <unk> power is something remarkable : they use two ingredients , proteins and water that are in their <unk> to create a material that &apos;s very hard to create a material that is <unk> by technical fibers like <unk> .
or you know <unk> beautiful things like this one , if the camera can make this .
here you can see how it &apos;s taken from tissue .
in my new project , <unk> <unk> , i want to use art to create technology .
there &apos;s also a microphone , which is the <unk> and the <unk> , and the <unk> -- hopefully not -- to help him to help him make some of his other decisions .
what are i going to do ? &quot;
and in the field of this time , it &apos;s never <unk> data , <unk> data , which is far more than <unk> <unk> -- he &apos;s <unk> the feedback of his audience and his behavior the answers of the amount of <unk> . so this thing is this thing ?
<unk> <unk> , inventor of the known <unk> of <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> , that there were two people who had a connection about only five to seven steps .
how do we change our mind about relationships to <unk> groups ?
yet , there was a <unk> that i &apos;m going to tell you , and where he might have this <unk> , you could have had to be able to go into the ear .
oh ... my father , a <unk> ?
it was his father who decided they needed wrong papers .
this sense of the responsibility about the lives of other people , and he was also <unk> by his young age of 17 years ago , and it &apos;s also his mistake , when his friends were taken from a camp while his friends had been done , he was going to get his entire life .
and while my <unk> and my <unk> , i thought , i thought , i was going to <unk> my father &apos;s wrong papers .
i asked him to be in the victims of the victims that he had ever had .
we &apos;re growing from a few million people in the seven billion people that we are today .
the arctic , a beautiful system , a beautiful system on <unk> level on <unk> level , which is a <unk> after the next <unk> , which is impossible in a good state .
if you <unk> the forests , the border on the <unk> , you <unk> the ability to get the ability to get stable , stable .
with the realization of <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and scientists , that &apos;s the great farmer of singapore and scientists , that &apos;s the most powerful farmer in the world .
but the matrix is , of course , that &apos;s clear that <unk> change is not a option .
this brings me to another reason , why i &apos;m here today : because i really don &apos;t like the same thing .
this is a <unk> of a conflict of a group of far developed .
first of all , he &apos;s going to use a ancient way of making the <unk> , and this is a three-dimensional perspective with a three-dimensional perspective , which was a whole new technology in this time .
and through the <unk> of sugar on black <unk> , i met portraits of them .
it was very big images , and i took them with a very big camera , a <unk> camera .
my interest on <unk> , especially in worse <unk> , it &apos;s very much more .
back at the end , one sequence is also a sequence of chimpanzees .
we can ask , is there is <unk> differences between equations and <unk> ?
and then you can compare it with the genome of today living people .
so we can ask us the same question , how many difference is , how many of these people are living with the ancestors of today ?
there are many people who used their own vision , like this vision of the beginning of the 20th century .
after my belief , the plane of the future is going to be their own consciousness .
imagine , <unk> grow in the 3d printer , and they &apos;re in a <unk> shape , and follow the forces that are in their components .
they didn &apos;t have languages , but they were extraordinary isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
they would <unk> . they would call the police .
now we know that it &apos;s about one of 100 .
you see a video .
you &apos;ve got the sense that the research that you &apos;ve been working on is really a effect on the reality that you can actually use a effect on the reality that you can actually start with my way on this area .
and then you <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , you put them in a reflection -- camera on the <unk> , poor <unk> <unk> of your <unk> .
they did all the same as we taught them .
and after the battle , they make these mobile <unk> , and they &apos;re doing what you call &quot; <unk> , &quot; to teach you what you &apos;re wrong .
the people are changing .
i said , &quot; where is he now ? &quot;
that &apos;s not a <unk> .
and she showed me on the left game to tell me how the cause of this image was that it was for them with the idea of the idea of what black looks like .
it &apos;s really in this sense of <unk> that i &apos;ve got a new series of questions that i have a new series of questions .
now , this is a kind of obvious statement .
and the children said , &quot; how are we going to do that . &quot;
i think they &apos;re trying to get numbers .
so i said , &quot; how long would you be working with me before you decided that you didn &apos;t understand anything ? &quot;
their <unk> have been <unk> in 50 , which else else has <unk> schools with a <unk> of teachers .
it was 26 percent . at the test , two months later , the result was 26 percent .
after eight ted talks , he wanted to be <unk> out there .
these are <unk> .
suddenly , i looked out of the darkness on the <unk> side of the place in the middle of the middle of the place that were <unk> from the moon .
if i had to reduce the entire story on a picture , what would it be ?
i &apos;m going to show you a couple of <unk> from my other big project in this year , &quot; the audience . &quot;
and our little life ends up in a sleep .
bono : &quot; they &apos;re <unk> .
i know you understand that .
so blue , blue , everything was blue .
i want to tell you two stories . both games in africa .
it &apos;s another , which is the <unk> of health and business .
let &apos;s use the markets as the <unk> <unk> that we have , and figure out what price people would have to pay for us is that they would have the choice .
thank you .
the <unk> was this : if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
we moved to two <unk> and 10 nets .
the little <unk> to get out of his <unk> , and that was a problem .
this is really good . it becomes slow .
i &apos;d like to show you a video of some of the models that i &apos;m working with .
so it &apos;s the second part of <unk> density and behavior is the second part , and that will actually be the key thing to use these models for <unk> .
thank you .
and the attempt to get it to the time was how to try to end a arrow with the <unk> end , and it was hard work , and young , boy , i have a lot of respect to nature .
now let &apos;s look at the other side .
we &apos;re working on projects -- even <unk> developments , as <unk> as <unk> -- with darpa , the california institute of technology and the university of los angeles .
you &apos;re careful , help you feel like wood or so that , like the way out of wood or so .
now i don &apos;t try to be <unk> .
they &apos;re going to go forever .
these are about two billion .
it takes it to his estimate about &quot; three years of <unk> . &quot;
don &apos;t forget that one .
but for me , it &apos;s great because it &apos;s a metaphor for the time that we live in the world of human mind and machines can win together .
i &apos;m very clear mass . where does it come from ?
it &apos;s too cool that the way in the building in 20 to 30 years .
all of the evidence that this cancer is based is that this cancer is <unk> by a virus .
i took the opportunity true , and there &apos;s a couple of samples from jonas &apos; tumor , and a couple of samples from other parts .
and she brought him to <unk> , and this was a little bit <unk> .
in fact , cancer is a <unk> result of the ability to share our cells and avoid their surroundings .
and i &apos;m not alone .
and this is a global phenomenon .
they would be <unk> to wait for it .
and this is the third reason why a low multiverse doesn &apos;t make us happy .
but they didn &apos;t have the numbers on them .
first of all , i &apos;m going to show you the <unk> for the optimism for optimism .
but the good news is that our illusion is not broken if we &apos;re going to be aware of this <unk> .
but what we &apos;re going to see in the 21st century is asia , and it comes out of asia , to get more than half of the world &apos;s world &apos;s population , and the half of the global economy .
you could look at this as the <unk> of the <unk> .
so , when i had <unk> sputnik <unk> , he said , &quot; this is the end of america . &quot;
if you live in japan or new delhi , or <unk> your view of china is going to be different than if they live in beijing in beijing .
and if we have strategies in which we &apos;re doing this in larger historical context , we &apos;re going to be able to do this process .
how do we define our national interests , so that it doesn &apos;t only be a <unk> <unk> , but it doesn &apos;t only be a positive amount of attention .
this is the conventional approach .
this has probably got the responsibility of <unk> to <unk> , to make a <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;re used in the same time .
poverty for whom ? especially for young men .
after all of the system , it &apos;s been developed , you can &apos;t get to be <unk> .
the survival would be from their own , after the conflict of the conflict , government <unk> .
this is the <unk> of my hometown new orleans .
the military has found it . they call the climate change a <unk> , the security and stability , whereas governments on the world , how governments are talking about .
it allows you to be more productive , so that you can afford to be more likely to be able to afford insurance itself .
these are certainly inspiring examples of possible solutions , if we feel able to feel able to be able to deal with a <unk> world .
listen to the chinese students in english <unk> by it .
teacher : perfect ! students : perfect !
and that <unk> things like the <unk> world with <unk> <unk> , lebanon that we &apos;re trying to try to do is to make really <unk> , and we also take the mathematical seriously , that we ask questions about what &apos;s going to be like .
jay looked at people , before she <unk> in the scientific age , and he found that these people were <unk> to a <unk> of the particular world .
and he said , &quot; in the north pole , there was always snow .
they chose <unk> instead of new york instead of new york .
it was not only the <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
would you get it to be killed ? &quot;
you might say , a decade .
it feels like i got in a form of pain . &quot;
and they <unk> me to make a <unk> in something .
it &apos;s still in the red numbers , but chris took it with personal <unk> , this film <unk> .
i am one of their <unk> .
there &apos;s a prime minister , <unk> , <unk> and a <unk> , or president of the <unk> .
boy : &quot; the <unk> is seriously .
we were all married to her , &quot; why do you do this ?
this is going to be a lot of real , if you read him . &quot;
we &apos;ve been sitting in the game for weeks for weeks ago , about seven weeks ago , and we actually had all the 50 <unk> <unk> .
and we have 600 billion dollars .
a lot of people said good jobs , and it <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s like his own little connection .
if i put all three legs of it , in the three peaks of the triangle , i would get a <unk> .
so all you &apos;re doing -- it &apos;s a very <unk> argument -- this old <unk> and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; . this <unk> is very simple in a old <unk> .
this is possible if you have a whole piece of paper , <unk> <unk> paper -- you can be in a <unk> school or in a <unk> school -- a sheet , a <unk> and a pen , there &apos;s no <unk> .
what we &apos;re doing is a very simple <unk> .
this is a little <unk> , which is what you &apos;re doing is these two corners here , it &apos;s going to be like a <unk> .
here are two drawings .
it was very many <unk> on the ship , and they became boring , so the captain died on his skin .
in the <unk> conference , <unk> <unk> is simple , and yet amazing plans to create garbage in really <unk> , very <unk> <unk> that are able to build kids , while they &apos;re the fundamental principles of science and the design of action .
it was a big challenge , and there were actually examples of biology that are a lot of evidence .
and there are a couple of examples of projects that we &apos;re trying to make ecosystems .
and with a little dialogue , we can produce a place that &apos;s going to be <unk> in a way that is the open space for people who are going back to their food and control with food <unk> .
this photo was done in the day , and only a year later , just a year later , it looked like this .
if you <unk> seawater , the first thing that <unk> is <unk> .
no , you &apos;ve got to explore the people &apos;s instructions with visions of <unk> . &quot;
i was looking at somebody who &apos;s nine , because i &apos;m <unk> , and because i &apos;m very important .
but the real <unk> was that there was very many men who wanted to go to me .
very few of us have the ability to be absolutely honest with themselves .
he &apos;d like to go , as long as it wasn &apos;t on a <unk> .
i tried to be in principle , like <unk> .
because you remember my <unk> : you have to get a <unk> of 700 dots , and nobody did this .
most of you . <unk> are in average 50 years old , not eight years ago , and if we look at the <unk> books of the <unk> , the <unk> of tomorrow &apos;s older adults .
imagine that your vision is very , very good .
this <unk> has a lot of other benefits in terms of attention , and a aspect of attention , and a aspect of attention , which is also more difficult , is our ability to explore objects in our environment .
and i want to ask you about this result , and i want to put it into the context of a different group of <unk> , a group that actually is in our society , which is in our society , that &apos;s from people who are going to do .
so let me step on this step with a challenge that &apos;s called mental <unk> .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just take all sorts of programs that we &apos;re looking at .
so it was a big , very complex project that i didn &apos;t even think about whether it works .
hey alpha knows about many and many things .
on the one hand , we have mathematica , with that kind of <unk> , <unk> language and a big network of <unk> developed data , able to create a lot of lines with only a couple of lines .
so , with physical <unk> , we &apos;re used to be used to go to the world and to see that certain materials are useful for certain technology and so forth .
now , a few years ago , i was pretty excited about the discovery that there are 95 universes with incredibly simple rules that <unk> a special relativity , and also the general relativity and gravity and at least evidence of quantum mechanics .
sw : i think .
and during that time , i was in fact more <unk> , and teachers , and teachers who <unk> me on hiv / aids / aids .
they go down . they carry red clothing .
so my mother was a woman , she didn &apos;t have it right up , and i was doing everything that was my family , but i was in my father , so he had this right , so he had it right .
and the day before the real ceremony was , we were excited , and they were excited , and they didn &apos;t have dinner night .
he was in a village , and it was in a village that didn &apos;t even even <unk> roads . it was very attractive .
i promised him to be a <unk> girl , i would come back and come back and do everything that they would meet after me .
when it was pregnant by marriage , the mother was going to make the mother &apos;s <unk> .
while we &apos;re talking here , 125 girls will never be <unk> again .
consumers who represent 72 percent of the u.s. <unk> , in fact , just like banks and business <unk> <unk> , they &apos;re going to use their <unk> , in everyday life , depending on <unk> and risks that are interacting with us when we move forward to us .
and what you see here at the end is the entire phenomenon of the fact that we &apos;re actually <unk> and the principle future education , the future children of our homes .
<unk> <unk> is about 48 percent , <unk> <unk> .
we also see a trend to make something <unk> . right ?
one of them is the <unk> of community and the neighborhood , and it &apos;s using the neighbors of neighbors as support .
we also see a big <unk> .
the trend of <unk> is enormous .
and then we take the phenomenon of <unk> .
and then the question came to me is i &apos;m the only one that &apos;s doing this ?
you could use them .
this is what i &apos;m doing in my life -- stories tell you , <unk> , and today i want to share with you a few stories about the art of storytelling , and even some of the <unk> creatures , the <unk> .
our <unk> could be <unk> . our hearts could be <unk> , and our <unk> could be <unk> , when we were in our cultural <unk> .
this is the first time that i was going to call it , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i &apos;m not <unk> , not a <unk> or <unk> , and i &apos;m going to ask why i &apos;m doing this , but that &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do is allow me to reinvent myself .
he wanted to see a fraction of my identity .
my tiny story became a huge story , because i became <unk> .
london has to get us on the other side .
i could put a novel about a muslim woman , and maybe it &apos;s going to be a happy story . and in my next book , i would write about a <unk> , <unk> professor in norway .
so , you &apos;re going to be <unk> . you &apos;ve got <unk> songs , and then you put it into little bits , and then you get a new song , but this new song is clearly , but this new song is clear out of old russians .
instead , these laws and the laws of the world is more <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , but i &apos;m going to <unk> what it is . <unk> <unk> : the <unk> of the telephone , by a symbol , is going to put a symbol with his fingers .
our creativity comes from the outside , not from inside .
and then you say , &quot; okay , but how do you see it , you know ? &quot;
but in fact , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the newspaper .
what &apos;s beautiful , you can probably see these <unk> , a kind of <unk> <unk> almost , which is about the <unk> .
our research of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
now this led to a understanding of the <unk> structure , because it &apos;s going to be so <unk> that atoms have a single core , with <unk> , which is <unk> .
this picture shows a galaxy , an <unk> , with , well , 100 billion stars like our sun .
i think you can also end up the <unk> ideas for us , about our place in the universe , and really the value of our education .
this is here . this is home . that &apos;s what we are .
and with each other , and every <unk> of the screen , we &apos;re using <unk> and <unk> <unk> of our personal information everywhere on our way through the digital forests .
when our daughter went to the <unk> <unk> , i asked them , &quot; will you go to your school much value on musical <unk> ? &quot;
we can &apos;t do that .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and because i talked so much about that , i decided i decided to talk about my <unk> birthday that i wouldn &apos;t talk about a day -- a day .
and you don &apos;t talk ?
and i explained to the help of a friend who was my <unk> mind that i was john francis , that i was not talking about it , and that &apos;s the last time that someone would translate my <unk> .
well , i &apos;m going to <unk> my <unk> again .
i started talking about this , because i was talking about <unk> .
but the <unk> was that i was thinking that i was thinking about my word , but never had to use my decision to use my feet only .
born , i grew up in korea .
sometimes i found small jobs in <unk> against food .
i was interested in the thing that i &apos;d like to do , and i &apos;d be invited to go back to it .
i felt like this , because i had to eat in america so much , but my father was died .
but i believe that your gesture of love and has to be able to save the life of a different writer , and it can change thousands of other <unk> , which is still the hope to survive .
it &apos;s very complicated to test new materials for the building , but this was a lot more more than i was expected to make , and it &apos;s easy to do as an industrial <unk> .
but then i was very disappointed with my job as an architect , because we don &apos;t help , we don &apos;t work for society , but we don &apos;t work for the society , but for them people , rich , the government .
and then in the next year , in 1995 , there was a big earthquake in <unk> in japan .
so i ask myself , what is a <unk> and what a <unk> building ?
but this is really necessary .
so , we learn some of the most important things in our life before we &apos;re born , even in the <unk> .
so , you learn to learn the certain language that &apos;s talking about in the world where they &apos;re born in the world .
it creates a mixture of the effects that are so useful and strange , like the wife itself .
why should i have <unk> disease in the <unk> disease ?
you can see <unk> , but you can see with other eyes .
this trust in the <unk> is the <unk> of every kind of <unk> .
the audience are going to be <unk> <unk> , which is very scary , but not with the <unk> , which is what happens to their eyes . &quot;
and if it &apos;s a good story , it &apos;s going to take us to smile even to smile .
it may remind you as the <unk> <unk> , ok , so that &apos;s when the greatest deal of all the time .
if you &apos;re a lot of the animal , and somebody says to say , &quot; what does you really do for the <unk> in the world ? &quot;
they said , &quot; can we go to an <unk> ?
this is actually a strategy , and i don &apos;t say that strategy is a role .
for me all the music .
now , if i put my software , the camera is the <unk> , and you &apos;re looking at the point of <unk> in order to the <unk> , and you &apos;ve got a <unk> .
i remember that the poor thing was needed to do something -- food , clothing , <unk> -- which they didn &apos;t have .
i never felt a <unk> of shame .
now , when i heard him talk , i was excited about different reasons .
i was not even going to be asked for a <unk> , which is , usually my way was .
it &apos;s about the <unk> of the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about to give us a way to be able to get a possibility of what you would say , a relationship is not one that doesn &apos;t mean , which is based on a traditional type of .
it &apos;s a <unk> combination , a very strong combination .
at the beginning , <unk> is still the beginning , and it &apos;s <unk> , for me very clear that it &apos;s just a way , just a tool , just a tool .
what &apos;s the future of humanity ?
now , i &apos;m going to show myself the second big question : are we alone or there are other lives in the universe ?
the answers to these big questions show that we &apos;ve done remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
look at this .
here are photos of me .
and the rate is , in fact , all 18 months ago , all of the <unk> member of the <unk> knows , that &apos;s the <unk> law .
but what about you ? what &apos;s going to do with you ?
they <unk> in their <unk> over the sky , and sometimes they <unk> people for experiments that their parents would not agree .
so we &apos;re interested in these things .
in the other generations , these experiments couldn &apos;t do this experiments .
and that &apos;s what i found was that the first technology ago , <unk> million years ago in a form of <unk> .
<unk> , we can learn very much about it .
and i see <unk> , and i &apos;m trying to protect my child , because with a child , you &apos;re not going to get a minister to get a minister .
and secondly , they tell us that they had a <unk> gang , but some of them had been <unk> by the <unk> of trees .
now , we &apos;ve been doing our knowledge about our ancestors in principle of adults , because the fossils , the <unk> , <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> <unk> shows the origin of humanity in the long ethiopia . he talks about how he found the oldest skeleton of a <unk> child , and what we can learn in africa about our humanity .
and if all of all of the rules about the rules , of course , is a cheap system to <unk> and <unk> , because how we &apos;ve found , we need to trust control .
it &apos;s going to look like a high lake , because the continent of <unk> <unk> .
we need to work their own , but also all the <unk> <unk> .
we need to create a new paradigm of <unk> and respect .
<unk> <unk> says , &quot; i would have numbers to do what i do . &quot;
that was probably a really good idea .
so to tell you , i &apos;m a journalist , no <unk> , so i want to design a document , like the present and the future is going to look like the present and the future .
and finally , i think we have to think about whether we want to think about whether we want our reality -- and when what it means for our idea of life , and for all of what &apos;s going on to our idea of life .
it looks like <unk> .
the symptoms of the complex is that you have the strong and <unk> opinion to be able to have the right solution , whether it &apos;s hard to be the problem .
botswana and i tried to write a article for the new york times to write and explain how it works .
of course , we can do this .
and make a lot of money .
it is higher than the <unk> of americans .
we &apos;re going to try . maybe everything is wrong .
in the same time , &quot; you &apos;re looking at it . &quot;
<unk> tried to get it back , but he could never prove the <unk> .
i &apos;m thinking that our approach is just not safer .
now , it &apos;s going to be done in 20 years .
we don &apos;t even do it down .
the future is <unk> .
yes , it &apos;s going to be ugly , and yes , it &apos;s going to happen -- with security in our life -- but we &apos;re more than able to overcome everything that is based on us .
and here they come into the game .
and what we need to think is this : if you put in the <unk> , what &apos;s going on as next ?
and we thought we can use these oxygen on our children , but you &apos;re going to tell you about it .
everything else is <unk> .
this is the financial financial crisis .
students wanted to know what the cell is going to be the cell .
that shouldn &apos;t be amazing ?
all of what we have is <unk> .
they &apos;re going to be able to focus on your mind , perhaps the <unk> , or <unk> can be a series of things that we can &apos;t do .
this is not 1,000 years in the way .
we should use this cheap , simple <unk> , and none of them to use their children . &quot;
and here we can see these standards .
we can &apos;t risk to lose the trust of customers .
he only got 500 , and they would have had to get to 1,000 . &quot;
and he had a huge <unk> full of <unk> that they got , and he said , &quot; come back in a week , if you &apos;re still sick . &quot;
the internet , as we know , the kind of the web -- the things that we all talk about -- is a little bit less than 5,000 days old .
of course , there &apos;s the internet for more than 5,000 days -- the web is only 5,000 days .
so if we say , the machine that we &apos;re doing is now a <unk> , a human brain , if we look at the kingdom that grows , there are six billion <unk> .
now , it &apos;s not that -- if you make a chart and things on the work , a word document is not part of the web , but they &apos;re going to be . they &apos;re going to be part of the machine .
i say , &quot; people are going to be the antidote to the machine . &quot; in some sense .
it &apos;s going to be on the level of parts or ideas or words when they want .
the last point i wanted to talk about is the idea that we &apos;re going to be <unk> .
third , it &apos;s going to be more ubiquitous . it becomes our entire environment , and we &apos;re in the middle .
and within a week , i &apos;ve been convinced that the second <unk> of jesus kelly had happened that it was the sun <unk> , and that i had been fascinated by god <unk> , and that i had been fascinated by god <unk> .
these are the dead of <unk> .
and it allows everything . it makes everything inevitable .
i &apos;m going to start with some simple ideas like we looked at things .
this is a project that we &apos;ve just done in <unk> for a huge <unk> , which was right from this process , it &apos;s the result of a variety of forces that we &apos;re doing .
and that led in a different project .
it &apos;s actually a wrong thing , because it &apos;s probably more interesting .
i &apos;m interested in how these ideas are going to be <unk> young people .
and at the end of one of the most interesting projects -- a <unk> .
every one of them comes to his neighbors .
that &apos;s how we have to be in school .
so we have a big brain , a big advantage , because we can change our environment .
my story is the two brains . it may surprise you , our gut has a <unk> brain .
this <unk> is very , very important , because there can be <unk> .
we learned to talk to the big brain , taste and reward , as you know .
he said , &quot; you know , at least once , we were all like animals , and then we don &apos;t have more . &quot;
these are men and women who can see even 250 stars in the night .
of course , the <unk> of them said that .
the <unk> , the <unk> of the sun , is actually an <unk> , which is actually a <unk> , which is all the light on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , called <unk> <unk> .
if you ask for the dead , they do with the hands of these gestures that they do with their thoughts in the sky and spiders .
here &apos;s the place where the big mother <unk> <unk> in the world that <unk> the mountains of the mountains and the home that they have to call the heart of the world .
it &apos;s unique <unk> of human imagination .
this material that you &apos;re all familiar with is <unk> , but i think it &apos;s more important for toxic white stuff .
i don &apos;t see it in there , you &apos;re going to be in there , because in a hundred years , my body can go back to the earth .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
you want to use it anywhere in the world , and it doesn &apos;t have to be <unk> or <unk> , because you have many alternatives .
first of all , there are atoms in a special bottle .
i &apos;ve been a competition , four years ago , a competition called &quot; dance your <unk> . &quot;
my country is about 15 trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s -- -- that &apos;s still a lot of <unk> than all the people who are going to come to me , and all the people who are going to come to me .
and they thought about my work on mathematical models that should be a understanding of evolution and modern genetics .
the other half of the audience may not be -- from emotional , cultural reasons , it &apos;s about boring -- and find a different pattern much more interesting -- <unk> .
you can think about two ways of thinking about it .
if you look at a coin , you get a series of head and number .
back to more , more <unk> <unk> , because of whom you &apos;re working with uncertainty .
and only about a percent .
he <unk> , &quot; i suppose that , after one of the <unk> , the likelihood of one of a family , the likelihood of one else . &quot;
not as unlikely as one in 73 million , but yet pretty unlikely .
the whole control , the <unk> effects on the industrial process , is going to be made of statistics .
the <unk> , maybe hundreds of thousands of lives have saved hundreds of thousands of lives .
it &apos;s more intelligent <unk> , because the power is always out , until the power is always made by a intelligent <unk> . simple .
but , on the other hand , china is a <unk> . it &apos;s an idea of <unk> <unk> .
you have facebook , we have <unk> .
yet , it can produce a very strong force , which has never been in the story of china , which hasn &apos;t never been in the story of china .
so , in the way , the chinese <unk> of this <unk> as the same medium , not only as short lessons .
how a big ted ted , isn &apos;t ?
so , in the last three years , in the last three years , <unk> <unk> is really changing , they have more and more transparent because that doesn &apos;t have access to the data .
even more chinese , free issues and human rights than their <unk> , instead of a <unk> privilege .
many of you know that the <unk> symphony was .
i don &apos;t say you can live a wonderful life .
girl : well , my sister can be pretty nerves .
the <unk> of music is much more complicated than the language of language .
this is a <unk> .
and it turns out , as if his <unk> had been out to try to try to try to get the number of <unk> , why there was a clay <unk> and his skull on the sides of the sides .
yr : joseph is phenomenal . he &apos;s brilliant .
if i go to <unk> , i see a special audience , i see a special audience .
in many countries , this is another thing .
so , in this remarkable point in the earliest story , my father was at the <unk> coast of the <unk> river in the back of <unk> .
the rate of civil war and oppression is since the end of the cold war .
my employees use their weapons as a tool of peace .
peter van <unk> : why i took a gun .
this program gets a shape , and then it <unk> 250 of the animals .
this is a <unk> in <unk> <unk> , in the middle of the <unk> .
you can &apos;t . &quot; don &apos;t . &quot;
i &apos;m very interested in two .
and i &apos;m going to give you a little example of this . but there &apos;s actually a discussion that &apos;s actually designed for why technology has evolved in <unk> ways .
now , evolution of our species needed tens of thousands of years ago , and because of this interaction we used evolution in basically the technology of <unk> species to create the next stage , which was the first step in technological evolution .
so we live in a three-dimensional world ; we can use the third dimension .
over the last 50 years , we had been <unk> in <unk> per year per year .
another big revolution is the <unk> .
to make our exponential growth of computing , 1,000 dollars on computing , the brain is about the brain of a insect or a mouse .
and in the year , we &apos;re going to be able to achieve the full <unk> of these trends , and they need to <unk> , as often as often the <unk> in the form of technology -- faster and faster when we get to this point .
and you can go to <unk> and <unk> with them .
they &apos;re harder .
they were removed from the <unk> .
because there &apos;s nothing in this . you know , it &apos;s not going to be there .
dopamine is apparently the stuff that &apos;s going to be in connection with <unk> .
and that &apos;s what we call schizophrenia .
and he was so hot , and he was going to give us the resolution .
i mentioned in our little thought ago , they &apos;re a <unk> <unk> in the african <unk> .
9 / 11 has a <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
and we have our own <unk> , and we have a <unk> product .
i was not as good as he did , but we made <unk> n <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and bruce <unk> on a <unk> , and that was a great experience .
they were always said , &quot; tell us the truth , &quot; and they &apos;re doing us .
larry and activist peter <unk> told his personal motivation , with the <unk> <unk> for human rights , and i told stories of active <unk> .
next time , we asked us how to do that ?
it turns out the problem and i know about this . the dance is his <unk> , which allows him to make a <unk> .
and the beetle <unk> a lot of <unk> on the pill , if they don &apos;t have a <unk> , when they don &apos;t carry them .
here is our <unk> tsunami .
let &apos;s see a <unk> and see what happens .
this is the universe of stephen hawking .
thank you .
<unk> argument that it &apos;s fun to move into this big adventure , is not going to go to my experience .
or , &quot; nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s next year was a <unk> in antarctica .
so the whole thing about the presentation of the <unk> to convince you that they are the entrepreneurs where they invest and have a lot of money to do with it .
and so on the experience of experience , a company to have a company or something -- that doesn &apos;t have to be a company .
there is no <unk> <unk> in which there was no problems in which there was no problems .
and from that , they take them up -- on a <unk> , radical path on the bottom of the end . right from the beginning to the end .
if i think about somebody who has made such a device .
no , they &apos;re not .
and then they give me a fast <unk> .
even if the competition is going to work for <unk> patterns .
it was hopefully all positive , positive , positive , complicated .
if you follow my <unk> , you &apos;re going to have a <unk> , very <unk> presentation . this is the class to <unk> who they are and to get .
i didn &apos;t know that this is pretty cool .
you saw one of them , one of them is a beetle .
if you make something called it , maybe you might have a effect on it .
and if you have enough enough , you can click another link .
we &apos;re at the end of the chart , at the last place as the culture that &apos;s not <unk> innovation .
so as we think , and our behavior , we &apos;ve broken our <unk> .
we have a <unk> memes -- seriously .
but let me tell you the problems today are not the problems of the industrial revolution .
and you know what ?
and who are the biggest <unk> ?
it &apos;s very <unk> .
our thinking is backwards .
with a <unk> change , change , like transparency , change , like the example of transparency , and collaboration , collaboration and collaboration , and not <unk> , these things are going to work on results .
because only the challenge is the only way that the things are always done is that the only way for us is to get the old <unk> , and make new creative solutions for the problems of today .
because we can &apos;t create it alone . we should do it together , and if we do that , and if we do that , and we can share the ideas of play games , we can create bulgaria to something better .
the magazine for <unk> , i think , &quot; innovation . &quot;
my <unk> took me with the <unk> , because the <unk> of the <unk> was in the end of the time .
after i got them out with a <unk> <unk> , they were very -- there was very -- there was me , and i worked there for six months .
nine days ago , i had a fire .
you know -- all of the stuff .
my children , <unk> and henry .
we &apos;ve got a lot of depression , we made our homework , but where we were also looked at , we were surrounded by images like this .
this picture was literally done in seconds after me , the baby came to the poor , and i brought it over .
rg : oh oh .
av : no number three : you don &apos;t talk about it -- but i &apos;m going to talk today about my talk today .
the general thing is that every aspect of my life is going to be better better , since i was in the miracle of birth and family <unk> .
but you realize that you have <unk> to lose control in wonderful ways , which is how we mean , our lives are very much a lot of meaning , and what &apos;s extremely <unk> .
rg : thank you .
i &apos;m going to start with joshua <unk> .
i started with the experience .
there &apos;s a result of &quot; star trek . &quot;
we &apos;ve all seen this &quot; star <unk> &quot; with the <unk> .
and imagine , big <unk> <unk> today to hear how you &apos;re happy to play . john <unk> walker shows how pictures of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and then they can be analyzed on <unk> wings .
now , since we &apos;ve experienced a time of extraordinary economic <unk> , the u.s. <unk> in the history of this country .
but now , a couple of months later , how good politicians are always going to be in this way , &quot; in the <unk> apple , without <unk> the video , &quot; like it once someone said , their uncertainty can &apos;t hide them .
well , i didn &apos;t really understand that , until i met this guy , a <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s a <unk> man , which was <unk> by <unk> and <unk> .
but interestingly , this is also a future , in which the society that &apos;s a couple of <unk> from capitalism , which is how to create the dna <unk> innovation in society , which is trying to do things , and then the ones that are working together , <unk> and <unk> .
i want to talk to you today a fascinating new hypothesis and some surprising new insights that i &apos;ve been working on , about the relationship between the structure of the language that you &apos;re talking about , and their willingness to save .
and if i want to talk right , <unk> <unk> me to think about it all the time .
well , this is a <unk> theory .
let me take this device with this device that you can see with their <unk> hand , so i can measure their <unk> .
it &apos;s the present pleasure in the <unk> of future pain .
i don &apos;t have to tell you how important the ability to communicate about generations can communicate .
we &apos;re in the way that we &apos;re thinking about .
but i &apos;m about to use them as a <unk> .
but they didn &apos;t have the results that they wanted .
and at the same time , i was on the field of <unk> , even though i was a chemist in <unk> <unk> .
people and <unk> and <unk> and birds and insects , the red line comes up here , and these are people , agriculture and pets .
we &apos;ve helped us more on serious <unk> of the future and <unk> products for the company .
let &apos;s see the next video .
this was the last night at the party , and -- you can see , you can see how it just <unk> , and you can see every <unk> that you want to do .
and he was <unk> about how people <unk> the test of religion in india to the time .
and he goes back as <unk> man to the village .
and he needs to go down his eyes , it &apos;s so warm , the <unk> and everything .
the animals are in one of their lives . people are people .
we &apos;re going to take us out . we take the sense of thinking about a mother and a half of these things on all creatures in this meditation .
and you think about how <unk> the things are when they &apos;re happy when they &apos;re happy .
and of course , they are cruel and <unk> to others .
even though the change in your context is something for other living systems , they feel these new quality in you , and it helps them , and it allows them to make them as a <unk> .
so the laptop is , or the cup of the cup of society used to get tools to get the public health care .
interestingly , the complexity is very high .
we heard about bill gates .
so it &apos;s very , very simple if you know how to read it .
all right , let me start with four <unk> <unk> , one example , a example , and two <unk> .
and i don &apos;t want to go through the details , but in the bottom right corner , you see a example of what we have .
did they start to do that ?
and that &apos;s where the <unk> of the things , what joe was talking about , what fathers was talking about , what our new kind of organization is , or better words : how do we organize ourselves without organizations ?
the inventor of things will always be more likely to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk> with the <unk> .
so let &apos;s start with astronomy , which i had mentioned yesterday .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> , <unk> arguments .
so it &apos;s not going to be <unk> of two camp , but between these teeth , there will be all interesting stories that are going to be used by people .
this costs about 100 dollars .
and then the people started to go to their <unk> , and in fact , a team made it to be able to be able to get out between new zealand and spain and spain .
and the first thing i thought was was to thank him .
but the truth is that life is happening right here .
so , the people , and you have the news , like this one &apos;s <unk> .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m like batman , to true my proposal to true . &quot;
and the one that doesn &apos;t have done , so that turned out that she was sitting in a different city , and a new job had said .
and in the last 35 years , i was talking about human behavior on the basis of all sorts of things , around the genes of <unk> , dopamine and magic , to <unk> .
and some of you have it . and it &apos;s dependent on gender .
this was one of these cases , because they didn &apos;t have violence under their ancestors , but in my father .
they &apos;re so similar to each other as you can only be .
by the way , i &apos;ve got a email tomorrow , which is that we &apos;ve done today that we &apos;ve done the last part of depression .
and these guys here are the weak force that might be familiar with the first .
so if you want to know why the sky is blue , or why <unk> <unk> , they should be in principle , with a <unk> computer -- why dna has the shape that they have .
the way is that the people in this room is the higgs boson .
but it &apos;s really like that , with this theory , the transformation of the future is , a completely wonderful prediction . a completely wonderful prediction . the model was not designed with the goal that this is happening , but it seems to do it .
they created this civilization , this wonderful image , the darkness in light , and that allows it to see the civilization from all the time .
one more big insight came from a study of <unk> state university in 2010 , in 2010 , the baseball cards of <unk> <unk> players from the <unk> of the <unk> .
in a similar study in germany , scientists in germany , researchers to measure <unk> <unk> to measure <unk> , and after them , they had <unk> in the face to have smile .
&quot; because the colors that they have <unk> , not the european genome , &quot; he said .
&quot; ugly ? why ? did there be more <unk> ? &quot;
we built the light <unk> that the people who have the people , the people who came to think that they were going to have been <unk> when they were <unk> , and they were <unk> by the <unk> .
al gore said , &quot; think about that you can do something , and you &apos;ve done it . &quot;
in cairo , entrepreneurs came up , and <unk> <unk> for mobile phones .
and one explanation for the <unk> power of technology is going to be in kibera .
for 2015 , there will be three billion <unk> on the world .
in the <unk> of the environment , <unk> , batteries and bread <unk> .
now , the river of time is in fact , in fact , in the <unk> of a <unk> , in the <unk> of a <unk> , in the <unk> <unk> .
do you read a interview with a writer ?
and yet , when i look at the big bears , i remember , as a kid , i remember , as a kid on his head , i don &apos;t feel about his shoulders , and i feel just like this kid .
we &apos;ve been able to see how creative technology can be and in our lives and our lives , we can do these solutions , innovation and moments , that the flow of time is not <unk> .
my mom was <unk> .
in every single camp , they had to <unk> soldiers , who was my older brother mark , who was nine , and they wanted to make him a child .
and i should do it alone .
give something something that you want to have , from the suitcase .
and then i ended up in <unk> , because i didn &apos;t <unk> my feelings .
thank you .
almost all life on earth is going to be about five times .
<unk> <unk> has the answer .
why should that be a role ?
so , as we can grow every one of the cell , we can grow every one of the cell .
this is the increase in less than 10 years ago .
here &apos;s the result .
now , when the <unk> is going to go to the same speed , the robot is the robot .
and you can see how <unk> the control is .
and he does that , as he <unk> <unk> .
they take their neighbors .
so this shows that we can use the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , where we can bring them to a few teams , as you can see here .
but the robot can also figure out where he wants to do .
i can understand that , but there are so many , and i want to get your horizon , the consciousness is open and to change their view .
this is a huge problem for many years ago , in principle since the late 80s with the <unk> of the <unk> , which is a lot of different viruses , bacteria and <unk> .
they don &apos;t see it .
so the use for your <unk> . and the honey -- there are <unk> -- they &apos;re using the honey on their goodness .
the bee dies . don &apos;t die , if you go down , you didn &apos;t want to do it .
okay , now what &apos;s really the question : why is this ?
of course , we also have been , especially in the last decade , the world with a dense quality of <unk> , with a quality of global diseases .
and never before was that many people were not aware of this fact .
in fact , i don &apos;t know many of you that our bread of course was not the european invention .
and especially in <unk> , in <unk> , and china is going to create the <unk> .
for most people , most people , and here are not many farmers under them , and here are not many farmers under you to be able to destroy the environment , to be able to destroy the environment .
everything depends on .
and so while i &apos;m doing my bread here -- and i &apos;ve <unk> it . and i &apos;m talking about it . and i &apos;m not trying to use the hands .
in fact , it has to be able to think about the country that there are <unk> tools to repair materials and <unk> .
you take somebody like me , a scientist , <unk> and <unk> , and we developed a new technology , and that &apos;s what i mean .
because i hope you &apos;re going to take this , a new connection with nature , a new connection with nature .
this was a few days ago in <unk> .
and what do we do ? what is our answer ?
this is about last year .
but <unk> <unk> was one of them , and andy <unk> was a film about her , <unk> queen , who should you see .
but i think the most important thing is that we can do it .
but this is <unk> , but it &apos;s <unk> .
this is a <unk> patient who was in the end of the time -- he didn &apos;t have to make a ring , but it &apos;s got to do this .
i like this slide , because you &apos;re going to talk to a talk about what people are doing to change , and what doesn &apos;t .
if you eat a <unk> meal , how do you feel ?
it &apos;s a <unk> . americans eat even more fat because the <unk> , and even more <unk> . so , the percentage is lower , but the actual number of higher , the goal is to reduce both of them .
one of the <unk> studies found that 70 percent of the people were <unk> , 65 percent of people had bad breath , 95 percent had a bad breath -- it &apos;s not healthy food .
on the other hand , it &apos;s all the things that make intimacy , <unk> .
i hope he doesn &apos;t see it .
the film is based on a <unk> of <unk> scott <unk> <unk> .
two <unk> were involved in the project : warner brothers and <unk> .
and we had enough passion to do the <unk> and technology .
that &apos;s how we <unk> us from motion .
the number seemed to be emotional .
and that &apos;s the data that we get to do with that , and they &apos;re used to be used for the model .
and so this was what the dream picture was used in the movie .
that was a very , very , very early man .
and we found this , in the middle of the state .
and it has a <unk> <unk> .
the people from <unk> are going to have these <unk> , <unk> past past , where they &apos;ve lived their lives long .
we were too <unk> -- two <unk> as a driver -- and imagine that , this <unk> is a ocean from sand , 40 degrees c , a <unk> .
i think the camel is the best <unk> animal on the world . &quot;
and they use them as similar as we see our <unk> .
we had our animals .
so i &apos;m going to show you another film .
i &apos;m not going to go back to my body , 40 degrees c -- enough to <unk> a egg .
<unk> , thank you for the invitation .
let &apos;s take a meeting with a poem . that would be a idea .
but how would it like to tell you if you never knew how to be a different day , if you were like a living god &apos;s world , your shoulders in the clouds , or if you sit down there , you &apos;re sitting in the <unk> <unk> with her little <unk> ?
who could be quiet in this night ?
but you know that <unk> <unk> in your age of 150,000 dollars a film , that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the french army , and <unk> <unk> his room -- no , i mean he had invented the <unk> ?
at the end , she sat in a tree , and one <unk> the hand on the other .
and the human <unk> is more than that , but then you would get these two columns , probably wouldn &apos;t be a lot of left .
in fact , we &apos;ve got the problem that you can &apos;t build a model that you can &apos;t build , to be hard for a single elephant .
one component of this is the understanding . here &apos;s a <unk> : &quot; the ability to understand the feelings of the other and share . &quot;
so let &apos;s study more complex . here is <unk> .
that the test is not good for them .
there &apos;s a very simple challenge that you need to do .
a philosopher wrote to us that it was impossible to have a sense of mcdonald &apos;s a sense of action , because fairness was invented in the french revolution .
now , it &apos;s not <unk> , it &apos;s not two crazy , three is a lot and a lot of power news .
the last decade ago , i &apos;ve spent this to be able to write pain and <unk> , hopefully for a good thing , the <unk> .
and i have to say god is .
so i heard about , in a sense , it was a success .
over the years , it can produce a serious <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : how the healthy life i &apos;m almost going to do for you ?
and i think a lot of <unk> this view .
one really cool thing .
now , these studies of biology , and they were <unk> , but they &apos;re not the entire story .
ask about the part of the story that doesn &apos;t be told .
is a priest ?
at the same time , a group that thinks that the indus people believe that the indus people are the ancestors of the people in today .
on the left to left , like many ? okay .
it can be useful to create more data , to create more data , which is <unk> .
this sign is the <unk> of the indus script , and only in this text , it seems twice .
it turns out that it &apos;s already a long tradition in india , who &apos;s going to end up on the basis of <unk> to the end of birth .
the outer space , we all know how it looks like it .
this wire <unk> the <unk> , who said the names of bell thought .
in fact , the historical discovery was made the historic discovery that are the same way that <unk> <unk> .
all the young people in the city .
someone who sits on in the seat next to you -- that &apos;s okay in a <unk> , and you would sit on a <unk> , and somebody would sit like that , then they would <unk> .
the dalai lama would always say -- he says , if you see in his mind , the idea of the <unk> , it &apos;s because you realize that you and your pain and <unk> finally have a very small playground for their own intelligence .
so let &apos;s see this wonderful thing that <unk> us has shown us , and they call us fear with the <unk> .
one man in a tank was to a picture , which was the entire world for the entire world to be a symbol of <unk> .
but what would they never have to do , if you had the modern communications to create a feeling that &apos;s wrong for the wrong thing that i had to be able to be able to be able to do something like this ?
using the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate to the global level , to communicate with the challenges that we &apos;re now in the world , and the most of global nature are .
in the museum of the children in rwanda , there &apos;s a photograph of a <unk> boy -- and the museum of the children <unk> of life who were <unk> , as in the <unk> of rwanda , there were a million people died .
here &apos;s the challenge : help me start to build a <unk> , <unk> <unk> in 3d .
you can move on very different <unk> -- they &apos;re <unk> in the <unk> , the movement of the surface and the <unk> .
so this is <unk> <unk> as the <unk> algae .
boy : <unk> .
let &apos;s start to see the <unk> in action .
<unk> <unk> at stanford , one of my partner , is an extraordinary engineer , which is a technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> , where he can <unk> water directly into a <unk> foot .
they &apos;re almost like <unk> , and the secret to what they &apos;re doing is their <unk> toes .
this is what we &apos;re going to do .
these <unk> structures allow it to the <unk> , <unk> and the <unk> , to be very <unk> , difficult surfaces .
and so , <unk> long beautiful <unk> , which is as <unk> as <unk> and males as females as females to find each other and to choose a partner .
so if dolphins are less than 20 feet apart , they have to get less than half of the time that we can produce .
if we think of <unk> for animals like dolphins , we need to have to think about the consequences of our activities that we have to be right now .
after the <unk> , the pacific <unk> has been <unk> these systems to learn what the scientists could hear .
you only hear the low frequencies .
if the males and females are using this signal to get a partner , and they &apos;re <unk> , you imagine what the implications of the amount of <unk> species would have <unk> species .
how ships can be done . they found out that with a better <unk> <unk> of that noise can be eaten by 90 percent .
it <unk> the speed of 50 percent .
we see <unk> worlds , we see strangers <unk> , 300 , and it will always be more . and they &apos;re not like we .
you have all sorts of possibilities .
we see a <unk> system in the men .
and obviously , there &apos;s one , the hundred .
so , as a hundred dollars , as the 100 dollars laptop , it <unk> me to think that we have a whole new generation of people in the old <unk> computer .
thank you .
i think nothing about this is the problem .
our daily life is , but <unk> said , in a particular state , we say , in a special state .
usually it &apos;s one or two per year .
and there they are .
but we &apos;re a lot of <unk> .
one part of the challenge was to try to try and move on the space , and i don &apos;t only have my hands -- the <unk> is much <unk> -- but the rhythm of my body and the feet , and to control the things with my feet .
and then you play crazy .
ok , because you don &apos;t understand what a <unk> is , i &apos;ll give you a little bit .
now again , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
you &apos;ve got someone on the top of somebody who &apos;s the <unk> principle , ok ?
<unk> -- and then it comes to calm , just a little number of time .
with space and straight in the room on other ways .
and then <unk> <unk> .
in this year -- you &apos;d like to show the advice -- in this year , we &apos;re going to get the <unk> of the <unk> with us in this year , a project that we &apos;ve helped with design in design .
we can call this on a <unk> , which is what it allows to make more information about the clothes while you &apos;re using this <unk> .
scott scott <unk> : i noticed that i &apos;m going to go on the way to get the original expert in the <unk> .
and we &apos;re also talking about a new product now . it &apos;s the first time that it &apos;s going to be shown .
in fact , the farmers can only be in the middle of the <unk> , and not in the <unk> .
electrons disappear in a kind of <unk> , and then it &apos;s just energy . and energy can &apos;t see it .
this is what he thought he was there .
potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . did you know that ?
okay . atoms , you can &apos;t see it .
and somebody said to him , &quot; well , what &apos;s the sense of this , <unk> ?
that &apos;s what we have about four years ago .
if google is a book , they bring it into a very beautiful lens .
i &apos;ll give you a example .
suddenly , in the middle of the &apos; 90s , everybody was excited .
but imagine , it &apos;s not going to be interested .
but also many of the right of the right thing that seems to be from propaganda .
if you put it down to the <unk> , it means a &quot; <unk> . &quot;
if i go to this pink sound for long than some minutes , they would literally stop to hear it .
a lot of people are <unk> , but this <unk> big , public rooms like this , <unk> <unk> , in millions of tiny little <unk> .
you can also do that in a beautiful place , like a lake .
and at the end , a <unk> .
and i said , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
thank you so much that you &apos;ve been here . we &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
and so they went away .
because they weren &apos;t going to be on the <unk> , and we couldn &apos;t see the exchange that i was doing between me and my <unk> , a <unk> , which is fair , you know , <unk> .
well , i tell you , in <unk> , there was a lot of competition in the last year , because the arabic spring is still <unk> , which is the <unk> -- what else ?
this photograph was even in a tsunami , and at the bottom of the floor , they &apos;re looking at the bottom of the people who were <unk> by the police .
the kids just make photos in a class , the teachers will get them , they <unk> them on the <unk> .
in today , it &apos;s about the brain , and , <unk> , somewhere out there is a <unk> .
this is something that we can work in our lifetime , and i think i can <unk> a difference , and so i was trying to get out of the <unk> to come into the <unk> .
but sometimes science has some other properties that they really do really interesting .
what do we make more data ?
there &apos;s something we believe , it &apos;s obvious , but wrong .
it &apos;s so that intelligence is defined by prediction .
but we don &apos;t look at <unk> as very intelligent , not in a human way .
in humans , we &apos;ve developed the <unk> part of the neocortex , with the names of the neocortex &apos;s part of the neocortex . the nature has this small trick .
it &apos;s not that you look at it and say , &quot; what do i see ?
not like a <unk> . not in the <unk> like a <unk> .
these are the things that looked at first .
we need some police , we need to have a lot of military , but only to charity .
you can see it on your <unk> . &quot;
they died because they were at the time of the elections of the country .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and then , when she got the door , she said , &quot; no , no , no , no , no , no .
they &apos;re paying attention to the hand .
this group uses three , every one .
it &apos;s real .
it has to learn to learn english and learning this as a foreign language .
the computer has already been in one of three people .
if yes , they think different than the <unk> of the united states was actually part of our <unk> , because that &apos;s what we did .
we <unk> this experiment with the same groups , but a <unk> one between the world &apos;s <unk> about how we do with the data , and the actual beginning of the <unk> .
so the price of that is the <unk> of the skull .
and they moved to each other , and they went back to each other , and they were going to get their arms to each other and <unk> .
we &apos;re really good at talking about skills and security and health and health , we &apos;re really bad at talking about character .
then you ask personal <unk> , the <unk> like <unk> against bad breath in <unk> .
i don &apos;t really feel with emotions .
so the first gift , or talent , is <unk> -- the ability to follow other people to follow other people and figure out what they &apos;re going to offer .
they have <unk> <unk> .
this is what we call the <unk> .
we found them between <unk> , raped by many , many men , i don &apos;t know how many .
where does your journey begin ?
and it &apos;s not normal to live in a home .
what was my challenge ?
they need their empathy .
<unk> : the process of <unk> .
well , at first , i &apos;ll give the queen the queen , because it &apos;s funny .
<unk> needs to be different .
the bad words -- you see if somebody thinks you &apos;re thinking , and then it doesn &apos;t look at the map , he thinks , &quot; this map is <unk> ! &quot;
and you think , &quot; ok , if we think that words are tools that we use to do expression of what we &apos;re going to use to look for our thoughts , how do you know that <unk> are better than a hammer ?
the <unk> has 33 different kinds of <unk> . &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and then it &apos;s this mike <unk> . mike <unk> lives in britain .
i have the entire time , &quot; the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
so i get a chair .
and to make a long story short story , this is me .
and this is a piece of game , while this three days , after this three days , you start thinking : why don &apos;t i hear all this <unk> stuff ?
you might be from a ted meeting , and so we can go to the conversation during the year , and the next year , after the same intellectual and emotional journey .
the <unk> , the <unk> didn &apos;t have <unk> in their cheap <unk> , because they &apos;re not sure what the public is going to do with one such <unk> <unk> , which could even fold fold on the eyes .
you know , you &apos;ve been insecure if that &apos;s already <unk> , and it was not able to be able to find the <unk> .
instead of <unk> <unk> , you don &apos;t care about them .
and , &quot; you can trust us . &quot;
we call <unk> &amp; amp ; <unk> and we live in india and work in india .
this is a video of the prototype .
this work is the cartoon of a <unk> people .
we &apos;re talking about what the world needs now is nuclear &quot; what the world needs now is nuclear &quot; -- right ?
and until now , there &apos;s only three <unk> of that -- coal and gas , <unk> , that &apos;s almost all the time -- and nuclear power .
we &apos;ve been going to be going to be going on the russian <unk> by using it in power .
<unk> emissions are <unk> emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles , the warming , and they were used for co2 .
now , if you look at the fact that the <unk> of nuclear gases is because we know , for example , that india and pakistan have <unk> gases through <unk> <unk> .
for wind , the size is much bigger , but the <unk> is smaller .
the reality is that 21 states have nuclear power , right ?
and in the south states of the united states , we need the support of all the parties -- only one or two voices are needed to make global warming , and this room can help .
we &apos;re not going to get <unk> sources to get enough energy .
i &apos;ve been worried about 10 years about the 10 years .
thank you .
that was -- my motivation was made by apollo <unk> .
for the first time , we have enough wealth in the hands of some less people , and the use of technology that &apos;s going to allow us to change the research of space .
fifteen groups from seven countries came up to the competition , each states between one and 25 million dollars .
<unk> -- we can bring them to the room .
and the <unk> for the <unk> is the sum of the <unk> and the social <unk> .
would you surprise us to us ?
that means that surfaces can get different times . they can be incredibly small .
a challenge was how we can make these new <unk> hope in a <unk> .
what i didn &apos;t know about time , because we only saw the outside , that the surfaces were going to be <unk> , within the <unk> <unk> , and that was a pretty surprising discovery .
from the process , michael <unk> , michael <unk> algorithms , the incredible , fascinating forms with millions of surfaces . no man could create them by hand , but you can build them , and they could build our understanding of architecture .
so you look at this picture here -- many forms dance here for them .
it &apos;s a very rare disease .
this is a drug that was designed for cancer .
you can see , the chip <unk> even the <unk> .
it &apos;s a very young nation that &apos;s taken by young people .
and i think many people here in the room , many of you are in the same position like me .
so i believe that women are going to be used in our society , because they realize that it &apos;s very important for their future generations is very important to get our cultural leaders .
we &apos;ve realized that since recently , more people are making more people like youtube and social networks to show their stories , to show their photographs and to tell their own stories with their own voices .
at the way , we &apos;re building them , and to explore our part of the world .
that &apos;s how i got more or less than &quot; nothing . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; well , if i put these ants together a couple of apartments , you put it out there . &quot;
this was called &quot; <unk> house . &quot;
so i thought , &quot; how can i do that ? &quot;
and when i was finished , i came back to the next day .
and it was ...
my work , <unk> <unk> , sometimes five , six or seven weeks ; you don &apos;t always <unk> .
and i put it around , and that was the <unk> .
so i <unk> the needle .
it &apos;s a very <unk> work , but the best things come in a little <unk> .
they expect of their employees that they &apos;re going to do what they asked them when they &apos;ve asked the challenge , they can do more .
there &apos;s this absolute concentration of consciousness , the absolute <unk> of consciousness , consciousness , an absolute center of compassion and love that the most of the most of the most important properties of <unk> .
my <unk> body flew into that one direction , my <unk> wheel in the other .
i asked all the <unk> that i probably don &apos;t expect to do with you , the <unk> , who i don &apos;t probably expect to do with you , the friends that i don &apos;t expect to look at .
because you don &apos;t need the <unk> .
and if you put them out of the back of the back , against the wind , you can just turn it down and it makes it <unk> . &quot;
20 years ago , the doctors had taken my leg , and he said , and there was a 15 .
as i was more <unk> -- and at this point in my life , i was probably 14 pounds easier than i am here .
and none of these modern <unk> in my eyes are more than david black .
back to walk , you &apos;re going to say , is the driver of what &apos;s human power .
he &apos;s <unk> by the international <unk> for <unk> , which is the first <unk> name i &apos;ve ever heard .
he was born by half months to early school , and it was really a fantastic <unk> of him .
so once i tried to move the piano , i was <unk> <unk> .
and at the end of the end , you were so fast that things like &quot; <unk> &quot; no problem , isn &apos;t it ?
do you want to hear me play ?
dp : &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
i don &apos;t <unk> it .
they &apos;re talking about their own life in this woods , in a world which is still clean , a world that &apos;s still not <unk> , in a world that &apos;s still not <unk> .
so today , we know that they are able to be able to make the research for absolutely impossible , when i started .
so , the long <unk> of <unk> connection to the mother who evolved during this long childhood , and also the <unk> , can get the whole life , and that can be to be 60 years .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and also the huge wall of the <unk> in the woods now have meat , and so we &apos;re going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re going to live in their wonderful life so many hundreds of years ago , <unk> .
abed said that somebody .
we have now in every state , and the problems in florida are other than the world in new york .
are they going to be able to get me down here ?
there are the politicians out there ?
what we want to do in the lab is so pretty much the same thing , but with a few dozen of different kinds of molecules -- that &apos;s the way that the <unk> is in the complexity , but yet , trying to create something <unk> .
it &apos;s also very <unk> . if you put it down , you don &apos;t really do something .
now , if you &apos;re all the experts for protocells , we &apos;re going to play with these protocells to play a game .
so we see the <unk> of this body of <unk> that we &apos;ve seen before , and the black <unk> in these numbers are these black <unk> -- these <unk> , very complex , organic black vessels .
in his lab , martin <unk> , <unk> <unk> of chemicals that are like living cells . his work shows how living cells on earth first was going to be done -- and maybe elsewhere .
this is a <unk> <unk> to put their <unk> on the night .
what is that -- where did they know that ? they did it .
but if we did that in each other -- you could be able to define what we could define .
<unk> is the <unk> , which is likely to be in their beautiful pink lungs , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with -- and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do with them .
the birds were able to go from one to another .
they can <unk> the world of him . they can talk to him .
but these <unk> , it &apos;s going to be a big <unk> of our planet .
at the next hand , we <unk> the skin cells , and they <unk> them in a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working for thousands of years with <unk> , by products like wine , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
it &apos;s true that if we &apos;re doing our research on the world we see our research , we see that it &apos;s almost a universal deal of people to have a car .
let me talk about hydrogen .
this is a huge <unk> energy to create the energy of energy .
if we can see this <unk> future , you can also see other other .
you had to survive .
and we &apos;ve been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to feed .
because why would our students get so far away from their students ?
it became a book , and then one of the <unk> .
there was a incredible idea , an incredible idea , a crazy idea .
this is the west coast of the west coast in the west coast .
but on this picture , you see how we started to build the <unk> , which was almost a big <unk> in brazil .
and for me , the time came up to me , i started to study the new <unk> subject of <unk> .
if you <unk> in the south <unk> , you see the evolution of new york city as it was , at the end of the american revolution .
the white surfaces on this map is that the <unk> of <unk> places .
or the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , insects and <unk> places .
maybe you &apos;ve got a <unk> .
it &apos;s so much force in the way , science and action is that these images are building these images , and it &apos;s like both sides of the <unk> .
and we &apos;ve got in our society now in our society , in fact , a really dramatic level of it .
so i don &apos;t have to go closer .
you make the <unk> , which is , of course , is going to be .
this is a <unk> building .
one example that we all know is this is the mobile phone .
and it &apos;s all about this question -- of course , in a very artistic and <unk> way .
but it happens everywhere , and these tools are parts of the things that help us make it .
ok , <unk> -- <unk> -- that &apos;s really great .
alex <unk> : a sustainable future
you could say that this is a big problem for a law , but congress wouldn &apos;t seem to be very <unk> .
but if you create a lot of <unk> copies , and it &apos;s sold , it &apos;s not okay .
some of the things that we share is that we &apos;ve found out of things that we &apos;ve found , and every single option that we &apos;ve found in this industry .
that &apos;s the simple thing .
i had a very <unk> , <unk> , expensive education in india , and that was almost broken .
and i thought i was going to go to a jewish college -- college , only for the poor .
a company is somebody , with a combination of <unk> , goods and belief .
when i said this , she said , &quot; do you show us what &apos;s possible . what do you do ?

get it in there to <unk> the presence of the schools , it comes between teachers and parents , so that &apos;s what <unk> the teachers and the parents would call the village , and they say , &quot; give you the hands .
you use <unk> .
i said , &quot; i don &apos;t know , mr. president .
a <unk> .
and our <unk> create one of the biggest , dynamic <unk> computers of the world for this kind of <unk> .
you can see this is the <unk> on the <unk> of what we have as artists for the scientists .
thank you very much .
interestingly , there &apos;s data of these two groups of people , data about how happy they are .
&quot; i &apos;m going to move it down , <unk> , emotional , and in almost every other kind of other kind of much better . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have a minute .
he didn &apos;t put him up the money , and of course , ray <unk> six months later the same idea .
in this case , it &apos;s because it &apos;s in the experiment that i &apos;ve been going to be going to be going to be used to you , <unk> of <unk> images .
we took our materials , went out from the room , and after half a hour .
i &apos;m going to show you why .
they &apos;re <unk> two images , and they had two beautiful <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> of it for them , and we said , &quot; what would you get to do ? &quot;
we take a completely new group of <unk> <unk> and say , &quot; you know , we &apos;re going to give a <unk> , and we can do it on two different ways .
<unk> , which is the big car , and the <unk> <unk> is beautiful .
voices : it flies in the air . oh doesn &apos;t .
&quot; mama , don &apos;t go ! &quot;
don &apos;t forget that this tradition is not from the <unk> of <unk> , but we &apos;re going to go back to a time , even before we <unk> stories on <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> .
the kind of food , yeah .
the number with the <unk> roof , you know .
and so we did my father his father , because i knew he would kill me if i had to drive them alone , so we go to the car . so we go to the car .
&quot; and i had this guy about a blue tube , and a <unk> expression in the face ? &quot;
now , i really don &apos;t have it in there ? because if i don &apos;t have <unk> , i &apos;m going to <unk> me -- enough design for their taste ? -- could it be that i never come back .
you see ? we &apos;re a myth with a secret .
she says , &quot; mom , you &apos;ve got to watch ! &quot;
&quot; i share the voice for the little , old lady , never . &quot;
it &apos;s taken out of the car . &quot;
i &apos;m really great fear .
so what is the social result of this ?
where can i go to this , and with whom together ?
and if we have it , we &apos;re going to decide how many kilometers we &apos;re going to go in , where we live and work .
<unk> <unk> on the table , and you see exactly where your bus is going to be on , and when he comes to the bus , and you can buy it in real time .
i want we &apos;re going to look at the wireless players , and i &apos;m trying to explore this network with open standards for each other .
and they came up here in the late 1960s .
and for all of you who came with a mental illness in order to know what &apos;s going to be doing for a challenge .
i said that i wanted to tell the <unk> , i wanted to share with you the three , and i wanted to share it with a <unk> video .
because they all were three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that <unk> <unk> is just a <unk> person , and it &apos;s about authenticity .
i ate <unk> <unk> . &quot;
you can sleep in clean <unk> .
j it &apos;s so many that this is going to be interesting .
i found it strange to <unk> , as if it was a competition , it would be a competition .
it &apos;s <unk> a white , rich <unk> , who was not <unk> for the city .
it looks pretty simple , but this was a <unk> .
the people <unk> over two things -- they were amazed about the destruction , but there was also a sense of <unk> about the <unk> of the new york , which i found very moving .
because , at the time , the four platforms on the <unk> -- where one of the better version of a <unk> is -- we knew that it had to be <unk> to <unk> conditions and the wealth of ground zero .
we have the possibility to explore our thinking about cities .
dr : it was a honor .
and i know that kids are <unk> every year .
if -- god forbid -- somebody from us here , and a neocortex <unk> , which is most of us in a period of a couple of hours to a couple of hours to a couple of weeks ago .
they have to know with the problems that we talk about today .
and as it turns out , tom has a call that a helmet for 20 dollars was a good opportunity to get a 100,000 <unk> .
that &apos;s not true , but it happened , and it happened , and it happened in 2005 , when his <unk> , of course , said , &quot; was discovered , &quot; and he was described to it .
in other words , they have a common and growing complexity of visual language that happens in <unk> .
he was told that there was no cure .
today , all countries are <unk> to use patents for drugs that were at least 20 years .
it depends on the <unk> of the wild , their patents to <unk> their patents , and they &apos;re going to be available for others .
in <unk> , the same kind of stage , the same kind of <unk> . the people were sitting in the <unk> sun , and they didn &apos;t never felt .
they can adapt all the way to worry for their well-being .
and he <unk> all of these services , <unk> , <unk> <unk> and so little things that you &apos;re just playing online , but for people that it &apos;s just done with the digital world .
the question was : how do you do from this teacher .
you see what he does here .
and the husband of the daughter , he was also sick by the <unk> of his wife .
but the visual complexity is still very big .
well , <unk> had a <unk> of our studies of our studies .
now , if we feel emotions , we show them .
and you could get the impression that the unhappy people get a different powerful position within the network .
this is my <unk> . &quot;
they &apos;re both out of carbon , and yet one of the two <unk> in which they &apos;re in a special way to be made on the left , on the left side , and they get <unk> , the <unk> and dark .
so to <unk> this , let me put it up for a moment .
older is not easy .
in the same context , older people are <unk> their cognitive resources , like <unk> and memory , more in positive information than the negative .
we cost the lives of life .
they wanted me to say , &quot; today , i &apos;m going to do this <unk> for this girl on this bar . &quot;
dr. david : it &apos;s so that i don &apos;t know , honestly , i don &apos;t know exactly what happens when i dance .
they &apos;ve called me father and uncle , and i was invited to come back from a day of five years .
<unk> : the second <unk> of <unk> <unk> is clearly the <unk> of the big sioux nation and the <unk> of the average black hills .
the <unk> from the <unk> told that at least three square quarter of the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> of land .
they were sorry .
the <unk> is eight times as high as in american average .
so what are we going to do ?
and today ? the child mortality was about 24 percent in the time today .
you &apos;re either going to take it up as a pill or a <unk> . you have to take it every day to <unk> the <unk> .
if we do it , like here , with people ?
but basically , it makes a lot of sense .
it says , are they smarter than a <unk> ?
nasa is a very clear car .
the problem for nasa is , this car looks safe .
now you &apos;re going to think , &quot; if my life depends on it , i would use it every day . &quot;
we need to connect this with a scientific method .
this is something else as actually to make an effective <unk> .
what &apos;s not new .
they &apos;re going to become dark .
we &apos;re doing it for our clients .
we &apos;ve got that in the sun .
now , logic -- integrity -- <unk> , you &apos;re looking at this position in this position -- without going to move the wrist .
i &apos;m going to be able to do this . if every time -- a different person -- not always answers .
so , if you &apos;re interested in this , i &apos;m going to show some <unk> .
so here , i have to look at the beginning of the beginning , so i can follow my cards while i can follow my cards while -- oh , we should have been working together -- no problem , no problem .
yeah ?
i think ...
lg : sorry ?
what map do i use to use ? the lady or the five ?
lg : but you see the hand .
well , moment -- wait , let &apos;s take a map .
another color . lg : glamour , perfect .
compassion .
<unk> , yes ? zoe : yeah .
here -- are all the maps -- there are all the maps -- is that all the cards -- is it true for me ?
and finally , the king -- in exactly ... five seconds .
some of you seem to know this kid .
after i got back to my entire company , i made my whole company . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have to hear a musical head , you could not look at it in the car .
let &apos;s see what &apos;s really happening here .
i always tell my students , &quot; if you &apos;ve got a <unk> . i &apos;m going to see you &apos;re going to see it all the way . &quot;
imagine the person , and you &apos;re going to follow the entire way from a hour after e , and they &apos;re going to hear all of you to tell what the <unk> had to say .
i had an amazing experience . i was 45 years ago since 20 years ago , and i suddenly had an idea .
she came up to <unk> when she was 15 years old . her brother was eight , their parents were lost .
so , ladies and gentlemen from the <unk> , look at this .
if you &apos;re the fastest of all today , they get 20 dollars . &quot;
now , for work of the 21st century , it doesn &apos;t work that <unk> , <unk> doesn &apos;t work -- don &apos;t work , and often <unk> damage .
think about their own work .
the <unk> of life is lower .
these are the building structure of a completely new <unk> for our business .
this one day very powerful autonomy has taken up to a whole series of <unk> , which might never have been before .
it &apos;s because you like to do it .
it &apos;s going to be used because of his <unk> weight .
in a series of 55 centimeters , they <unk> , <unk> , every signal and their spaces are <unk> , until this small earth .
and the blue side , the <unk> , is showing the other direction .
that has evolved with the years of a lot of <unk> .
the <unk> on the object would probably be a <unk> image of the earth .
but they &apos;re going to get the 10 percent or more back , which is most <unk> or <unk> .
<unk> dollars , and in a trip to <unk> <unk> dollars .
dozens organizations have to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to try and <unk> their reputation through the <unk> .
so what would you do ?
the nature came up now .
dan <unk> : our mindset about charity
then there was the <unk> <unk> , yes , that &apos;s how to get your part of music .
people who have done these <unk> , the <unk> , all these beautiful tools .
he said , &quot; i &apos;m responsible .
it &apos;s just about the <unk> of music , as it was written , not about interpretation . &quot;
that &apos;s great . and what about the eyes ?
that &apos;s what he does .
you know , the authority is going to be used when they &apos;re needed . it &apos;s very important .
so , the <unk> is about the process .
and as a <unk> , we tell ourselves many stories about the future and about what are going to show you from here .
there are <unk> countries in the world .
and in terms of climate change , it &apos;s not really <unk> .
and it &apos;s a process that really makes joy .
it tells you whether you &apos;re going to get it further .
and the <unk> said , &quot; if we didn &apos;t have the transition <unk> , we would have to invent this entire public infrastructure for the first time itself . &quot;
but there &apos;s a problem .
the budgets are not really <unk> , and until a certain degree , the games you &apos;re playing to see this is the theme that you &apos;re going to play , the subject is so much that you can &apos;t see what the most important challenges are .
in fact , there are five states that are worse , and really only four states that this big challenge is not about .
and even if you &apos;re looking at it , you could use money out there .
it should be more like private <unk> .
but i had a <unk> , when i went to <unk> <unk> , and i was at a <unk> in my life , and i tried to decide to decide between music and medicine and medicine .
if you laugh , you know .
a lot of years after the <unk> , a young lady , who i knew that sex is probably going to be so good for the five senses .
and that &apos;s going to be <unk> by good sex all five senses on a extreme level .
of course , the five senses is not the only thing that life is interesting .
we &apos;re all born as artists .
if you have a conversation , the child has to get the next answer to the nearest answer to <unk> what it started .
but your parents tell them , &quot; it &apos;s going to <unk> all of the waves . &quot;

but this is how a teacher is rare .
in <unk> , there are always people who <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; or &quot; texas california , &quot; as they <unk> <unk> .

if yes , it &apos;s going to give a global warming .
but the <unk> is exactly the expectations .
the economic consequences are almost <unk> .
a big part of the species is going to be <unk> .
now , if you &apos;re going to happen a car car , it &apos;s critical that we don &apos;t only have the <unk> , but also the trip .
so something was used to be <unk> . once it was all the thing that you had .
but today we use a <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be an <unk> .
and 1960 , joseph <unk> <unk> from the united <unk> air force was really incredibly incredible .
one of the trouble in this height , if you go to 10,000 feet -- that &apos;s great , right ? if you go to 10,000 <unk> , you can actually use oxygen .
now , you &apos;ve designed a <unk> to him , just like that , it looked like it .
we expect to expect other people , maybe the <unk> or the <unk> of this is going to say , &quot; you have to put someone in a suit that is not <unk> by the plane that &apos;s connected to the plane . &quot;
there was three <unk> -- not true ? -- -- that &apos;s about the conference that are important for what i want to talk about .

feminism is for me as a hand that wants to get a hand that wants to get everybody around the things .
before i go to the middle east , i want to leave <unk> as <unk> with a quote of one of the most major <unk> .
it &apos;s also the <unk> .
okay . they &apos;re <unk> in behavior , and they &apos;re <unk> in the mind .
we don &apos;t have all the facts . we don &apos;t even know what tools are going to be , or what we &apos;ve got to look at is just to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to come in .
how are you going to increase it ? &quot;
these are all the same , even though they &apos;re all the same , even though they &apos;re all the same in different context , one is remarkable , the other two are like working on these books , because they &apos;re doing something very special about it .
the children have taught them .
they were very warm .
we also believe that the content is important .
i was changing by my children .
howard makes this experiment , and when he comes to the data , he <unk> a curve , and suddenly he noticed that there is no beautiful <unk> .

he became a couple of time , and i spent the most important of his career in the bottom of his career , and then he ended up in <unk> , and he became the general manager of the <unk> a <unk> .
we all know what happened , as millions of women , over decades of <unk> to the symptoms of <unk> , until we &apos;ve got a huge study , <unk> from the national <unk> , found , found .
thank you .
but father <unk> , and he didn &apos;t want to do that we &apos;re doing that .
but there &apos;s also a <unk> between space .
these are four really different ways to see the world . i said it &apos;s called .
so what &apos;s interesting is , once you <unk> -- and -- by the way -- that &apos;s from <unk> -- show all the artifacts of modern comics : <unk> <unk> simple <unk> without <unk> and a <unk> from left to right .
and that was what i mentioned : we might be able to do comics on an infinite screen : on the <unk> , and on the <unk> and <unk> .
this is from daniel <unk> <unk> in britain .
maybe you &apos;ve got a lot of time , but for me , as many of the things that i &apos;ve been doing right now , i had never seen this interesting day , i had never seen that the <unk> <unk> challenge was never seen .
this is honest and <unk> , and the reason , this is what <unk> evidence like this is a sustainable impression .

the web is all going to do , and it &apos;s going to be very soon a lot of human activities .
interestingly , we also use the <unk> information , but not for the benefit of resources .
he explained to me as he was in 2003 , and 2004 , as he went to a new york , 10,000 dollars from the <unk> here , 30,000 dollars from the horse here , according to <unk> <unk> .
he was born in <unk> , in a <unk> and <unk> war , his phenomenon with play as an <unk> , he made him <unk> to the <unk> .
and most of the people , with variability and <unk> , they didn &apos;t have the real social skills in the world -- only in the net .
i think there are several reasons . i &apos;m not going to go to the details , but some of them .
but they &apos;re all <unk> from the market . and what the market is , especially -- number one is the big <unk> .
we also found a lot of examples of deaths that have been done in all sorts of social institutions , many schools , many schools , many schools , and many libraries , and many libraries , like this one .
and finally , i think that the streets are going to be <unk> by the <unk> of the mall .

it was <unk> by the <unk> .

it &apos;s about a gender , which is a fundamental resource of the planet , which is women .
it &apos;s a <unk> , and the kind of exists in the body , and i think there &apos;s a real meaning , our bodies , and i think there &apos;s a real importance of our bodies -- that this <unk> has created a <unk> , which is also often the job of the decision .
i want to tell this little story about my own study , because that &apos;s a lot of happiness with happiness , and with agnes .
maybe it &apos;s in my <unk> south carolina , who &apos;s not much smaller than this today , and once from a future as a <unk> country .
well , maybe he was too <unk> , because he was in where he was , even long after <unk> <unk> through the <unk> , and even after the <unk> and <unk> in budapest .
and he got the same answer : &quot; do you ask me the best workers you can find , and if you &apos;re good enough , i &apos;m going to do it . &quot;
and also clear , it says , &quot; it &apos;s okay . it was all so beautiful .
&quot; ah ! &quot; i said dr. larry . &quot; i was in the movie alone . &quot;
as i said , he <unk> too much .
and you can imagine it &apos;s right .
you know what you &apos;re looking at .
but we &apos;re talking about the most important cases , and it <unk> the other day for the next day .
so we came to these two rules .
so i went to russia , and my mom went with , during the time of the soviet union .
and if you think it &apos;s not more , it doesn &apos;t make it so long until you do it .
what i want to try to do with this -- i hope to show the following dots .
and what i want to show later in the presentation , 50 percent of the united states is under the ocean .
it &apos;s <unk> , because the <unk> is not going to be able to get the average depth of the ocean , which is <unk> miles .
and so we went down to <unk> in a area next to the <unk> , and we found the <unk> heat .
so i started to develop a new <unk> , with a <unk> , which is <unk> me , and i don &apos;t have to go into my car .
we find the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i looked at it yesterday , she &apos;s on seattle . ok .
but i would be a child without a woman &apos;s control of the control of my <unk> .
in some parts of the world , for example , in south africa , education is just hard .
when we looked at the effect of the <unk> , he decided that we had to increase it , and i think that we had to increase it to be able to offer as many people like the best education .
what was the special thing about this ?
the video is going to end up every couple of minutes and the students will ask a question .
and so we wanted to convince some of our colleagues of the neocortex that there &apos;s not such a bad thing .
and in the context of particular , you can ask questions that are the most <unk> and how you can help the students to fix this .
we even see the beginning of all the time through a <unk> <unk> or <unk> feedback that we showed them .
i thought about my place in the universe , and what my first thought was , what &apos;s my first thought was , as i was a kid .
and in our society , it &apos;s mainly mainly about the reality of other people .
i &apos;ve got so my doubt about the values of <unk> science , as a example of <unk> , it &apos;s going to be rational .
and so you can understand my surprise when i had to read in the new yorker , i said that <unk> <unk> , <unk> of <unk> <unk> , who said he was <unk> .
i think you can make care about the funny thing that they don &apos;t have , and not about the ones who don &apos;t have . right from this reason , i don &apos;t have a surprise about <unk> <unk> and his <unk> .
i &apos;m going to <unk> this old times of the <unk> , which i say , i &apos;m going to tell you .
he said i had to pay him more respect because it can take to 18 years , because it can take to be a really good <unk> .
huh ? yeah ? i can &apos;t hear you hear . &quot;
and i &apos;m afraid of that active somebody doesn &apos;t like us .
i &apos;ve been talking about <unk> <unk> thought about beauty , which they were talking to us yesterday , and there &apos;s the <unk> in his book that the <unk> can be able to be able to do beauty .
george gilbert bush : what the defense of our security is used , and what the training of our freedom is used , we need to pay the price . &quot;
ten years ago , there was no <unk> on the world &apos;s idea -- well , or very few astronomers -- that there are planets outside of our solar system .
a lot of other ecosystems on earth are actually actually in danger .
he <unk> all the way that a experiment with a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> that could be destroyed the world .
we need to be able to get the same <unk> , like <unk> .
this is what we don &apos;t want to see .
what can we do ?
and now the worst thing is the worst .
we use a lot of money to make sure that we &apos;re not going to die in the <unk> , but we &apos;re going to give you almost nothing about it , and yet it &apos;s completely <unk> .
we don &apos;t want to go back to the wrong foot .
i hope that &apos;s going to do it .
that &apos;s very , very important , because this is the system that &apos;s going on on the planet , and it &apos;s about the time for us to understand it , and it &apos;s the time for us to understand it .
it &apos;s an amazing insight . and we &apos;ve heard about it since recently .
and this is what the system <unk> , a number of <unk> in the southern hemisphere , in these circles .
everybody who comes back to this is just going to get to the database , and it can <unk> the information that will be needed for everything that &apos;s going to happen to happen for everything that is going to happen .
we &apos;re about to test the wave , the kind of technological possibilities .
in a earthquake , huge amounts of these new microbes that we never saw before , from the bottom floor .
<unk> john <unk> is a network of <unk> cameras and sensors that are our oceans to the global , interactive lab , and we have a <unk> <unk> about the world of depth .
so i think that optimism is the architecture of architecture .
so again , radical against beautiful .
the <unk> against the <unk> . you know , too often , you want to understand everything .
our traditions are complex .
you know that it &apos;s true ; the <unk> , as unexpected , will always be unexpected .
but i prefer to play something completely <unk> , and even with errors , instead of <unk> the same time , that it &apos;s from his <unk> feet .
stories of rooms that had never been as <unk> as they should be in a <unk> city .
there are the emotions of victims .
richard <unk> <unk> on very large ideas . he &apos;s called it from 17 ways that his vision of architecture is essential -- chaotic , <unk> , strong -- and inspiration for every <unk> of creative work .
it also has the lowest <unk> of all the cars of the size of this size .
is that something really <unk> , or will it just give it a few <unk> ?
em : that &apos;s what you just have to do . if you don &apos;t , we are in a lot of trouble .
with this capital , and <unk> <unk> <unk> on the roof of the roof , and then <unk> the <unk> , or <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , which is less than the <unk> .
we &apos;re almost failed , but we &apos;ve got in 2008 about this .
it &apos;s kind of like a <unk> .
how about all in the world could be able to be incredibly innovative ?
look at this .
boy , if you <unk> our benefits , and a <unk> sees how he &apos;s going to be one of our goats , he &apos;s very nervous , it &apos;s very nervous .
we had hunger .
our tradition looks like this : in any <unk> , there &apos;s a <unk> fire .
now , we were working with the world of the world the world that are able to be able to be able to get the very small programs to create the very small programs .
very important -- we invest the money in the world of aids and hiv .
<unk> -- and again , a <unk> under many of the world of <unk> -- are very useful , they &apos;re very useful , they &apos;re a wonderful tool .
and we <unk> this price behind ibm .
dan <unk> and alice <unk> , and alice <unk> , the <unk> revolution .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that was the famous species .
this is like a <unk> of protein .
the science looks at the world through the mind , <unk> , things that can be considered , but they have a part of the art for knowledge and insight .
from the plan of a couple of cameras after three weeks after three weeks ago , a plan with 25 <unk> .
this is the natural <unk> .
it &apos;s not going to be a <unk> photographer to do a picture so that &apos;s right ? but sometimes we have to be able to be able to test the dimensions .
here you can see how the earth comes back .
this is a couple of cameras here .
could india be the origin or a global center for innovation , just like it to be a global center for <unk> and <unk> ?
if we asked the people in these <unk> , what they were working on , they said , &quot; we &apos;re working on global products . &quot;
they can &apos;t be a professor if they didn &apos;t even met students .
the best hospitals , in the people who were going to go to <unk> , and in <unk> , <unk> , heart disease , heart disease , for artificial <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to four a.m. in the morning .
it works a little bit like -- this is a recently <unk> <unk> for four in the morning .
i said , i know a <unk> message when i see one .
every one of our society comes with cancer -- if not personal , then by a poem people , a student , a colleague , a colleague , a friend , a friend .
in this <unk> , the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a <unk> .
we &apos;ve created tumor in the lab with about 20 different cancers , and we see this effect on all of them .
he got the <unk> .
but what we can see is that in the sixth month of the tumor , and he &apos;s going to start <unk> .
that &apos;s just the beginning .
this is a new orchestra , a new project .
in fact , they &apos;re seven feet deep , and they collect rainwater from the roof , there &apos;s a little shirt , and it &apos;s a little shirt .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it looks like this .
there &apos;s a <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> through this scene .
this is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; in english , we have <unk> and <unk> .
and they &apos;ve got to go back .
these are the beautiful category we saw on one of the images .
and the <unk> are about 27 percent , dozens of fewer people per year per year .
10 percent of india .
they &apos;re going to get the jobs in borders that people get out of the <unk> , and they &apos;re going to bring them into the way to <unk> and prosperity .
and the countries on the right , you see the <unk> . in principle , every country with a <unk> , we say , fewer than 5,000 dollars , we say , less than 5,000 dollars , a <unk> .
in the first 20 years , in the &apos; 60s , in the &apos; 60s and &apos; 70s , india wasn &apos;t so right .
buy african products .
but i think there &apos;s a lot bigger problem with this is that this logic -- that we should be ipods and not <unk> -- i mean , it would be an amazing title for thomas <unk> new book .
now , 500 people came up , and four of them were forced to come to visit the space , and so they go to <unk> , and then it &apos;s about <unk> .
so now , citizens with <unk> to 2020 is not necessarily changing anything about it , because it &apos;s still the instructions that control the agenda .
<unk> <unk> : is the internet <unk> of worst expectations ?
&quot; like a man . &quot;
and he was working with our younger guys .
because for me , in this time , in this time , and in this <unk> life , the question was : &quot; don &apos;t you ? &quot; either sex or drugs -- and drugs we didn &apos;t have .
i was like paralyzed , people .
so , in fact , politicians , and so politicians , and <unk> , i &apos;m pretty much about the <unk> that we &apos;re talking about india as a new way of the talk about india as a new <unk> , yes , even the new assumption .
in other words , we &apos;re going to tell us all sorts of <unk> stories about countries , regardless of whether the people want to come to <unk> or not .
but in our country , in our country , there was pretty slowly <unk> , and it took about half a hour to be a call <unk> .
you can &apos;t understand the <unk> .
this can have <unk> consequences . ok .
and this one of you who have the money here , like to be surprised to see how many of the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> , which is to explain the <unk> .
i went home and started a little bit , and i found some amazing statistics .
<unk> <unk> : a <unk> without water .
and now i feel like george bush .
now , this title , this expression , is from a critic , a early critic , and this is a slide that i just love , and i would like to read them .
and that &apos;s a good thing , because if it would be like , mother nature has a problem : how about everything in the world , we get chimpanzees to make chimpanzees ?
this is the hardest part , which is not obvious . and so , i &apos;ve got to finish it up for the end .
ok ? stop . this is going to be <unk> .
i don &apos;t know why there are <unk> <unk> , but not , they &apos;re in the garden .
thank you , thank you .
in fact , i believe that the <unk> is probably a lot of reasons , why we want to know new things very , very quickly .
it looks like this . you should see something like this .
and there was a different narrative , a different version of this practice in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; 60s , in a pretty famous experiment in the &apos; &apos; 60s .
and we learned that in the time , you &apos;ve learned a lot more better , a lot more creative results , if all of all of the rules are thinking about the rules .
and suddenly , there was a radical conversation about design around a <unk> object .
they &apos;re sometimes a little bit skeptical , and i &apos;m going to come back to it .
you know how it feels like this , all these uncertainty , as long as you go back to <unk> , as the doctors go back in one of the <unk> , and you ask yourself what &apos;s going on here .
that &apos;s how we all feel secure , and we would have a good time , because we &apos;re talking about the rules , and we would be talking about the rules of that .
we &apos;re doing everything that leads to success . but then if we &apos;re in there , we believe that we &apos;ve done it . we were willing to listen , and i just hear that to do what we did .
i was faster , but so depressed .
i learned that success is not <unk> .
and the <unk> is just full of dark girls . &quot;
i actually wrote , &quot; oh my god , &quot; -- hopefully my god , the last time in public .
he &apos;s sure that all of the things are going on .
it took 15 people in this part .
and the second thing is that people are going to find a real connection .
these are questions .
as you can see in many modern democracies , allows the society , the state , the state of the state we don &apos;t only get our self to create our self , but he doesn &apos;t need it .
it means that we should have our full potential than human beings .
so these are the protocells , the kinds of questions that i wanted to do today -- the question i wanted to do today -- the question : what are the intentions that comes to the application when you do something ?
and so i said , and my colleague , sebastian <unk> , is that there must be better ways .
and we were successful .
i &apos;m going to give you a <unk> .
he <unk> them in the right position , <unk> them with his nose and <unk> .
we learned the first surprise .
it had to give you a kind of <unk> , to create the <unk> amount of force and the speed that we see and the <unk> of the system .
and this is a collection of forces , and this is actually a <unk> model with a chair in the inner skin .
this is the <unk> -- here &apos;s the <unk> , and this is going to be <unk> , and it &apos;s going to go to the balance .
it &apos;s very , very , very <unk> solution to the special problem .
and <unk> : it &apos;s not earth , <unk> , it &apos;s ocean .
i think this is one of the most most beautiful classic <unk> that were ever built .
i don &apos;t know other <unk> , not even <unk> , which is just the easy thing to understand that this is a three-dimensional space .
now look at this -- he &apos;s going to get me simple .
the <unk> , the last year , was this here .
<unk> is the understanding of architecture as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i &apos;m sorry for the obvious example -- is not the right approach we need to choose .
in fact , new york on the back of <unk> , our streets had been built by their <unk> .
in these eight <unk> , <unk> <unk> are a little <unk> , which is essentially <unk> .
so , in london , in london , and it was overwhelmed by this <unk> .
we created a map of <unk> a map of the <unk> .
and this is what happens every second week .
i made her <unk> on the top of the <unk> temple .
and in this area of the amazon of the amazon , <unk> oil .
the other side of the field is <unk> <unk> , where it &apos;s actually going to be <unk> . it &apos;s <unk> .
that was one of the big <unk> .
this is the <unk> . let me go back to me , and you &apos;re going to show you the <unk> <unk> deep field .
but then you get to jupiter , and it &apos;s 40 minutes far away . that &apos;s a problem .
that &apos;s going to be the part of that , in which it &apos;s about the beginning of the universe .
we only have a million galaxies .
so the stuff that &apos;s happening in the picture knows is dark matter .
when you &apos;ve seen this image for the first time , you don &apos;t have to see a lot of it .
this simulation was taken by 1,000 <unk> a month ago , just just to do that .
in <unk> , we &apos;re doing an resolution that &apos;s about this image of the earth , where you can actually see the complicated pattern of earth .
and of course , we &apos;re <unk> , of course .
zero percent .
this is crazy . this is what we &apos;re all doing , even in the lives of life .
i moved to a <unk> . this led to many pain and problems with the <unk> , so that i couldn &apos;t think almost nothing to think about it .
so i asked myself , could you be creative , if you &apos;re working with intent to <unk> ?
this is not happening today on the morning .
it &apos;s <unk> by <unk> , just like a <unk> <unk> . there are <unk> <unk> , and there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> of the 30s , the <unk> , killed millions of <unk> . in the &apos; 90s , they looked at the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . many of the women were used as <unk> to germany .
that &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do . &quot;
and as a <unk> <unk> , the idea of most that we learned about what we learned in the virtual world in the virtual world , and we could use our identity , to use a better life in the real world .
we &apos;re going to get to a new way to be growing alone .
our relationships are <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
it <unk> them .
because in the moment that people are alone , even for a couple of seconds , you &apos;re going to <unk> <unk> , <unk> , you &apos;re looking for a electronic device .
but we &apos;re in danger , because in truth , the opposite is true .
i &apos;m optimistic .
but apparently , we didn &apos;t have all of us with the <unk> that some of our <unk> , and pretty often -- -- pretty often , i felt pretty often that they had given their predictions on the financial way .
now , if my father was always reading my father .
so , i was going to get it back to it -- but i had to be tired of it .
and finally , i thought i had a pyramid , but i don &apos;t have the time to go back to it .
although you &apos;re not going to be afraid of failure , if we &apos;ve got <unk> all the time , because who has given us more desire than to give everything out what it is .
if i &apos;m going to call names , i never know a answer .
am i enough <unk> ?
the second challenge was cells .
today , in many clinical trials are going to use different kinds of stem cells for heart disease .
for the last month , it &apos;s done with this technology that we &apos;ve done with this technology that allow human <unk> .
we can put them down and put it to <unk> degrees , and so the kidney of all of their <unk> properties , and then we can just take this information , and then you can see that information is easy .
i couldn &apos;t go back to school . i didn &apos;t go .
i was a kid , i said , &quot; yeah , i want to do that . i want to do this surgery .
you may have noticed that a new area is called <unk> .
and together with this <unk> , there was examples on the entire world -- from the choice of a president to <unk> wikipedia and everything in between the time -- that showed what the force could achieve .
third , <unk> , <unk> issues .
because what you need , this is the hole , not the drink .
i don &apos;t want a cd , i want to do the music that you &apos;re playing .
i &apos;m hot joseph and i &apos;m <unk> in kenya .
we need to use our women and children <unk> , we need to drive . &quot;
i &apos;m trying to improve infrastructure .
at night at night , i went home with batteries and ice .
here we have someone &apos;s <unk> ?
co : i decided to stay in the country to be able to give the <unk> in moscow , and to work in <unk> to work .
this can be huge , but if the city can win a number of x volunteers for <unk> hours , the <unk> of the <unk> work in the city of the city .
they have <unk> , <unk> and data .
so these are , in the 18 minutes that came to me to talk about here , between two and <unk> people who are going to be used in cities .
and he was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> .
the building here have several stories .
these green things in the foreground are <unk> .
and if you &apos;re a <unk> <unk> , you have political activities .
i couldn &apos;t know that i would be part of a technological revolution that would be true this dream .
think about it . these guys who don &apos;t have the same <unk> , like me , helped me , with their <unk> support , <unk> <unk> .
at the same time , we &apos;re not going to be <unk> with a <unk> , but by using a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , he was able to develop a machine that could read each other .
but you know , i think i think it &apos;s very happy to read me of machines .
because it &apos;s not allowed to replace these books about the border , in the different <unk> countries : britain , united states , canada , australia , australia , australia , australia , and new zealand had to have all sorts of <unk> of harry potter .
the <unk> . life has been more than doubled , and they &apos;re growing up with an speed of five hours a day .
one last thing . do you want to ask people like me , ok ?
secondly , the new machine is a very good news because , as soon as the <unk> work , we don &apos;t have to do that , and we don &apos;t have to do it , and that &apos;s the <unk> .
the social challenges , because of that inequality should be <unk> .
the economic game is surprising clear , and surprisingly simple , especially at short view .
and my biggest concern is that we create a world , with <unk> technologies , embedded in a sense of a <unk> society , and it &apos;s about a economy that uses inequality instead .
in the course of years , i started to feel more <unk> with this notion of god .
some of them have <unk> that we can only think of a god that we can only think of our pain .
in the second <unk> , the line is &quot; wind and waves <unk> him . &quot;
so who is god , if not the big <unk> or <unk> ?
the <unk> soul of the universe .
if you look at the god in the back , i &apos;m going to <unk> my own <unk> .
one of the first things i started to explore was the story of the <unk> &quot; technology . &quot;
we haven &apos;t found <unk> , who were older than 40 years ago , and the average age of this <unk> and 9 tribes is 20 to 30 .
our body has been used to be used to this new diet .
so this equality of energy and matter that einstein showed up , and also the modern science of <unk> shows that entropy and information and matter and energy and energy are connected to each other , so it &apos;s a long store .
this is a robot who wants to get his own <unk> to get more electricity .
and what i mean is that we &apos;re looking at a new job .
so , a great development that started about billions of years ago , and it goes through us , and our choice is , and our choice is actually in the technology that &apos;s much more powerful than we do .
and they said , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got five classes , <unk> 30 to 40 students .
we put it all down , and we found beautiful <unk> , <unk> bars , and it looked at this -- while we &apos;ve said , somebody said , &quot; you know what it looks like the <unk> of a ship . &quot;
so we were waiting , we sat on the <unk> , and they were waiting for them .
there are a lot of <unk> . the only problem , especially for the adults who are working on <unk> , who didn &apos;t really know that it was just a toilet .
the teachers with whom we &apos;re working on -- everything is different for teachers -- they tell us what we should do .
so , dozens of 50,000 <unk> have been working with them in the book , and so this is what this wonderful works .
and right behind that -- there &apos;s probably a little quality -- right behind that they looked like children were talking about .
there is also these <unk> -- it &apos;s a shelf that you don &apos;t see if you &apos;re in the <unk> , but it opens it slowly .
he &apos;s <unk> . he brings his <unk> .
<unk> him a email , he &apos;s going to tell you every question that you can imagine .
i was this girl .
eighty percent of the refugees in the world are women and children . oh .
there &apos;s one side that &apos;s thinking that peace is the end of the <unk> , and there &apos;s one side that thinks that peace is the way that peace is the act of schools and business .
she sent their children to school -- found a new home .
there &apos;s also one , which is called the expression for full games , did you know ?
in the woods , there are <unk> roads , and we &apos;re all going to drive here .
that &apos;s my baby <unk> . thank you .
he &apos;s basically said , &quot; i designed everything . &quot;
and in a certain sense , i &apos;ve always felt bad .
so i &apos;ve been able to get this kind of <unk> .
and i found out that teenagers are very good <unk> .
the university is at the most <unk> , so is number 10 .
especially in a strange <unk> <unk> of <unk> , which is about a window of a window , until the moment , in which the road was <unk> , and they had this <unk> <unk> in the sun , and this <unk> <unk> there in the sun .
and i was fascinated by the great presentation by andrew armstrong , that religion really didn &apos;t understand anything about thinking , but to do with behavior .
so , the <unk> has seen <unk> . the same size . it doesn &apos;t look like this , but it &apos;s just the same size as the united states , <unk> of a <unk> , which is about the same size of the state of south asia .
but it &apos;s not only the developing world .
we can &apos;t wait for the <unk> , who had australia to change our political culture .
this challenge is part of the structure of our entire civilization .
a new appreciation of the <unk> that we &apos;ve been through the assumption of this challenge .
before i &apos;m going to show you a couple of images to <unk> , i want to tell you about this beautiful details about <unk> and design .
the <unk> is in this sense , really a extraordinary school .
we &apos;ve been talking today with keith <unk> , that many scientists don &apos;t tend to show something beautiful in their study to show something beautiful in their study , from fear , as stupid <unk> .
so here &apos;s examples of that you can actually print in 3d , which is very interesting to see what &apos;s very interesting .
so that allows us to think more about what robots do for us .
no . so i had to think a little <unk> .
we did the same for iraq .
this was a challenge that we had to ask us as a physicist .
we can stick it up . the forces of <unk> more . there are more of them , but they &apos;re <unk> .
<unk> seven : <unk> seven .
and there are some employees in foundations that we call the <unk> .
the idea of justice that our lives of our lives , and we have a sense of what &apos;s right now in life , which is what we should do , social justice , is what we should do , social justice .
and that &apos;s how that &apos;s like this , <unk> as the <unk> .
so , every week would come back to the <unk> . &quot; god , you &apos;ve got me home . &quot;
they &apos;re a symptom for a tumor , a fish , a <unk> , or a surgery .
the muscles were <unk> , paralyzed -- <unk> <unk> like this .
we treat them with <unk> drugs -- <unk> -- who said , <unk> , in this kind of pain , is not very effective .
now , they &apos;re going to get a sense of how much rock we &apos;re talking about how much rock we &apos;re talking about here .
it was <unk> . it doesn &apos;t matter . so i can live with life .
i don &apos;t know if you can see it from the back of the back of all , you can see it &apos;s only stars .
in 2005 , nasa started a field called the deep impact called the deep impact , which is a part of a part of the <unk> .
these are smart guys -- men and women -- hans , as i said , engineers .
the difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we can have a <unk> , and we can choose to change our future .
in this time , i was <unk> , the only independent , to be right , the only electronic medium of the country .
and i thought <unk> would survive , and a great company would be , if <unk> was just gone .
and at the end of the bus , he says , look at it , you &apos;re not going to see your money , but my foundation is going to get 50,000 dollars to the table , but my foundation is going to test 50,000 dollars on the table that you can test the idea .
and we said , this -- that &apos;s right , we &apos;re going to meet us , you &apos;re going to take us your <unk> with what they actually did .
you see , we &apos;ve got in afghanistan and <unk> with our work , and they were going to go back to russia .
after a long time , we took a <unk> .
and we &apos;ve evolved the idea that we &apos;re going to spend the idea of earth , in the <unk> press .
and in this way , you &apos;ve created the <unk> , so that it doesn &apos;t have the <unk> , no blind , which is going to be able to be able to find yourself .
so , why does that work ? that &apos;s the question .
well , some people call a theory of everything .
so one is a simple example of this : nasa found the law of gravity , which works like one shared by the quarter of the <unk> between the other <unk> objects .
the more that you have , the more symmetry you have to do the simplicity and readers of the theory .
one thing he thought that he thought was most of us before , but at his time , it was not granted .
it doesn &apos;t <unk> the importance of this app that they follow <unk> laws , and accidents .
but he read in every free moment that he had , books .
from this ambition , he was forced to go back to <unk> .
but when he was thinking of his signature under the <unk> , his hand was <unk> , and his hand , because he was sent to a thousand hands as a <unk> .
not very surprising -- it was only three women under the 16 <unk> in the white house .
but i have to say , the older thing i became , the more thing i &apos;ve been doing for a incredible privilege was to have this aging lion from a man so many hours .
and so , as lincoln was the story of the story , all of the time went to the war after the u.k.
i asked my father under tears , &quot; what can we just do ? &quot;
so what the reason is that i &apos;m always grateful for these strange love to be about the story that allows me to spend a life on the past .
he had the temple <unk> and <unk> .
this is the <unk> , this object is the evidence that the jews came up to <unk> in <unk> , after the entire years that they were sitting in <unk> to the rivers , and in the <unk> of jerusalem that these jews were going to go home .
all of these are forced by cyrus .
the <unk> cylinder is from the <unk> of the great <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , written .
you all know what happened .
and to see this object in tehran , thousands of thousands of iran have come to tehran .
some of you know more about the world &apos;s living behavior , but they don &apos;t think they &apos;re a <unk> <unk> .
now , the new <unk> babies in the first couple of hours , but their needs were not <unk> , and they didn &apos;t have been able to try and <unk> it . within less days , they were <unk> , <unk> and start in the air , as all else .
one study shows that <unk> 10 percent of a <unk> cost , whereas <unk> about 30 percent costs .
and this fascinated me , because i &apos;ve been spent my entire life before a camera .
you know pretty quickly what you have to do to do a answer .
it was <unk> people there -- most of the friends and family .
we heard every single person .
but of course he never had . the explanation never happened .
and after many , many students , i was excited that this man , <unk> <unk> , really one of my heroes and mentors , it was done to get surgery into the boat .
so he said , and we found ourselves in afghanistan .
they were the ones who believed in the peace , and it &apos;s about his possibilities , etc . , etc . , and they were actually going to be true .
we connect with <unk> -- i met <unk> <unk> , and i said , &quot; at london , it &apos;s about <unk> .
it &apos;s about their <unk> , to your business .
the biggest brains of the world should be the <unk> rules .
i <unk> the <unk> of this number , but i could never find them .
there &apos;s just a big <unk> .
and amazingly , this is exactly what our ancestors have invented about 1.5 million years ago when they discovered the cooking .
very simple insight for the <unk> conversations that i created .
and i think i &apos;m sitting on the beginning .
but once the <unk> <unk> , the physical harmony was <unk> .
and she was a child , his son , red in the face of the face of work , his father .
but mahmoud and his son were already there .
in the night , i was talking to my budget in the <unk> , and i said to them -- i <unk> -- i said , &quot; look , we &apos;re going to start with a couple of hours a day , just for a couple . &quot;
two groups of the <unk> began to fight .
so i asked him , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
but yes , we need to increase the production of feet .
he was a new man , even bigger .
<unk> , not only in the <unk> , but also in the homes of people .
and they should see me as a <unk> .
and this hospital had had been able to afford <unk> .
why ? because of the way that i had had to have , it was banned .
but i learned something like this , which is that the leader -- the <unk> of the economy -- <unk> of the economy of the economy -- incredibly bad choices that had to put our economy before the <unk> .
because i knew the state of the african continent for my children and children would be important .
i &apos;m trying to get the experience that i had to bring to africa .
am my time to go ? ok .
we &apos;ve done a moment that has a great society in a generation that can take a great society in a generation .
you &apos;re going to see that he &apos;s going to be the <unk> blue ball very much -- the sun we draw as children .
in fact , this is something that half of you , more than half of them are not going to be familiar .
n <unk> <unk> <unk> .
ah , &quot; i don &apos;t care . &quot;
and these are the messages that they eat them ?
because , in the bottom , the <unk> love it is , and so he brings them into television .
a professional <unk> , who speaks to dead , they didn &apos;t get me ?
what &apos;s <unk> ?
we &apos;d like to ask about people , like you like <unk> , <unk> and fossil communities , so they make something like it .
thank you .
so that &apos;s why the entire hospital is often about a <unk> .
it has to give something better . &quot;
but it can &apos;t control the user , whether it &apos;s the electricity or not , because they can control the <unk> on the basis , how much percent oxygen you can give their patient .
but we want to be sure that this is the most important and frustrated device that we can use hospitals .
the different species of writing in africa , the first was <unk> , like the <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of a secret society in <unk> .
before 1998 , when a <unk> <unk> called john <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> , who had been <unk> in <unk> to 1900 , centuries ago , centuries ago .
almost a fifth of all the greenhouse gases comes from the way -- that &apos;s more than the heat .
not bad .
i like animals , and we like to create the benefits of <unk> and animals to produce animals , not just so fine .
<unk> was a very old story .
one image of <unk> would be better , right ?
so it wasn &apos;t really bad .
i &apos;m going to ask you a question .
some of us would say that that &apos;s probably not so bad .
now , about a year ago , i asked myself a question : &quot; why am i , although i know what i know , i don &apos;t know what i know ? &quot;
you &apos;ve got the choice .
you can make a picture with a iphone and all the names , even though there &apos;s a little bit better .
it &apos;s <unk> . he <unk> the <unk> .
you can &apos;t see it , because it &apos;s too big .
you would say , it &apos;s about interest , more about thinking , if the <unk> is so high , but it &apos;s a very <unk> area .
or an aesthetic experience -- a <unk> or a big artwork .
the human nature had to change .
but one part of the reason -- and that &apos;s the reason we have an ethical level in the <unk> of this -- is that they &apos;re also very valuable .
it might be more complicated , but maybe not very much .
jh : is it <unk> with these forces ?
and so i knew i knew that i need to do something about it .
so there is <unk> , there is <unk> , there is the dynamic behavior of liquid .
and so i think they can be <unk> .
this is a great <unk> in the studio .
we take the pizza , our first pizza , and <unk> the individual <unk> , as the <unk> in the <unk> , and <unk> us .
i was sure 20 , before i first went in art .
i thought i thought , okay , you &apos;ve got some criteria like you &apos;re going to take the work .
it &apos;s not <unk> work .
they &apos;ve been interested in creating alternatives to create alternatives , and they needed money , so they needed money , so they decided to make some interesting <unk> projects .
this project is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and so we went to the grave , and we made this , it was <unk> -- the attention we had .
and it describes like the <unk> -- all of what she says is , because of course , that &apos;s what they say .
he &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and he &apos;s also a artist .
it depends on origami together . so this is what we &apos;re doing .
people have mathematical principles on the art to understand the <unk> <unk> .
or you eat it on the top , and there are 50 stars on a flag with 13 <unk> .
how would you make a single flap ?
we &apos;ve found these rules with whom you put circles , you &apos;re on the <unk> with lines , the extra rules . that makes the extra rules .
you can do a lot of things .
but if you want to do it bigger , you could need something origami .
and it doesn &apos;t work , whether you go into space or whether you &apos;re in a body .
i grew up in a <unk> in the state of washington with a lot of free time in the state of washington .
we only have three minutes , but we &apos;re talking about <unk> hours to talk about it .
and so i want to talk about that , because if we don &apos;t prove it , it will be very painful .
and in a moment , i &apos;m going to show you a graph , and what you &apos;re going to see in the chart -- it starts in uruguay , just before the women begin to <unk> the <unk> , and it &apos;s going to go to the time for today .
you &apos;ve got out of the bottom of the bottom .
because i write about all this in the book , i &apos;m still doing this , and i don &apos;t have the answer .
and that was very <unk> for them .
because we don &apos;t have this information yet , they come back to us in shape of telescopes , in this weird , <unk> , in this weird and <unk> way where you can see that we &apos;re changing .
there is no man , or no woman who &apos;s in the middle , and it &apos;s about the <unk> .
now , the personal income on a scale that became a big thing that has been <unk> to be <unk> , in this time more than doubled , it &apos;s almost <unk> .
and to hear me and understand what i say , you need about 60 bits per second .
in fact , it happens to me , so in the last book of mine called &quot; good business , &quot; i met a few ceo who came from their environment as a very successful , and the same thing was described to the same <unk> .
control is still a safe thing , because you don &apos;t feel in your mind , but it doesn &apos;t matter .
&quot; where are you born , grew up to school ? &quot;
because when my grandparents were born , they had their own meaning for what home is . they had their meaning for the community , and even for <unk> , which was <unk> from birth to <unk> . they didn &apos;t really have the possibility to go beyond it .
more and more people are in the future or present time , like in the past .
i went down to the room that i should sleep .
<unk> <unk> : where is you home ?
there was a big gap between the <unk> countries and the two billion in the developing countries , and the two billion in the developing world .
but this is the world that we have today . no gap is more .
and let me show why , by the time , i &apos;m going to <unk> the digital technology .
the survival of children is the new green .
and again , they were better than we said , &quot; your british and your mortality of heart disease is shocking . &quot;
but if you have people <unk> , you don &apos;t change the high number of heart disease .
and i started trying to work with <unk> , and then they grow up , and then i &apos;ve been working with <unk> -- mice that couldn &apos;t produce the gene .
one of the subjects was my <unk> , and of course , i don &apos;t know how old she is .
if you &apos;re going to be in the summer as well in summer .
all of a lot of progress , many <unk> lives .
this is even real photography , in <unk> , which shows that it turns out that it &apos;s <unk> in less days .
and here &apos;s exactly what six months later , what happened six months later .
a <unk> is from two different neurons .
we put it back into this <unk> device device .
it &apos;s much more complex organs , with the same <unk> organs that are <unk> , with every lot of <unk> organs , with every lot of <unk> organs like heart , liver , liver and <unk> .
this is still in the <unk> .
we prefer cells that are not <unk> , and no tumors form .
we only need five seconds .
for every problem there would be one idea .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m like to think about -- unlike all of the <unk> and sugar , which i had -- but this is a very <unk> .
it doesn &apos;t mean that you have to visit a <unk> .
i went from door to door and sold .
it &apos;s like a recession . so , there is a recession .
and you would be able to do this chairs .
this is impossible . &quot; you &apos;ve got to find a way to get faster for money .
i sold a lot of <unk> .
they don &apos;t get a public income , but they have the opportunity to find more tasks , and they learn that the ability of <unk> , and they &apos;re also learning the ability to find more possibilities .
if you go to a restaurant , and you &apos;re going to give them bad , you &apos;re going to show you how bad <unk> looks like .
these young , <unk> .
so the development of today students is , all the interests , except one of the <unk> .
the <unk> of <unk> , or a <unk> of the cultural <unk> , is the most important of our students , the most important of our students .
the values of the past will be <unk> , and that brings every lot of society .
but it &apos;s a politics of principles , not the <unk> .
they have a mind . and they have other people .
what we should do when we think about conservatives -- except this case of the 1980s -- because this case of the 1980s -- it &apos;s about the church .
yeah , i know you don &apos;t really think i really don &apos;t know .
and this is not just a different result , it has the potential to change the potential to change how we do with each other .
it &apos;s different .
in fact , it &apos;s not the same organization , but clear -- let me start the beginning -- creative commons is a simple way to put their content with the <unk> that they want to leave them .
john <unk> .
and i wonder how many things happened .
he told me that he <unk> the <unk> , and then he said , &quot; there &apos;s a box in the next room , and we &apos;re going to <unk> . &quot;
so , for today , i had the idea that i &apos;m going to go through this process and show you how this journey looks like .
and the hospital and general <unk> were also happy .
and i was designed to understand that we &apos;re going to understand .
i &apos;m going to ask people , &quot; is it really possible to use these microbial ecosystems to use our advantage ? &quot;
another possibility of how microbes can spread through the people . architects are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the <unk> interaction or <unk> of ideas in which <unk> and offices and offices .
imagine a design of design , the microbes in the airplane , like , in the plane or on a telephone .
and nobody knew about it .
my company , <unk> , built a system called <unk> for the apple philosopher .
in 1987 , his <unk> came from the <unk> .
and joshua wanted to get the <unk> . and a method that i wanted to do this was to be in , one of these <unk> , one of the <unk> <unk> .
in <unk> percent of voices , to give you an idea of the <unk> <unk> : <unk> two in the <unk> <unk> has only three percent .
and the last message i want to tell you is : you can be able to be very successful .
i think i don &apos;t need to explain what a big privilege it is to be here today .
this is the school that was built with the community .
something that we have in gando are <unk> .
just like that .
good morning . magic is a great way to be able to be able to be able to do this , to make this possible to make what science tomorrow was really going to be doing .
there are the color red , and the color black , they &apos;re going to come to night to night .
voice : why not ? that &apos;s a very good sheet .
this is a illusion .
so this is china , a <unk> , and not so much a <unk> .
but you can &apos;t get a country like china , in the basis of a civilization , on the basis of a civilization , a system , a system .
and the reason for that is , first , the state in china gets a very special -- have a very special <unk> than the <unk> , the embodiment and the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> of the chinese civilization , the <unk> .
he was 120 miles long , to <unk> in beijing and shanghai .
we &apos;ve seen this in terms of <unk> -- which is the position of <unk> <unk> -- or the <unk> .
he &apos;s going to put a street in the <unk> , and the cars are going to go under the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> shows blue <unk> , green <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> is the <unk> of the <unk> .
and the first song was in english , the second was in chinese .
she said her song .
i made the camera , i wrote my name all over , used to the city as a reef .
i mean , these were the faces of my friends .
they &apos;ve all been told that her picture would come back to the time every single day .
&quot; you know , you know , you &apos;re a <unk> face -- this is a funny thing , right here ? &quot;
in most places i went to , i decided to go because i heard about it in the media .
i took more photos , and we launched the project .
are you a <unk> organization ? are you from the media ? &quot;
so the roofs were <unk> , a woman said , &quot; now , i can see god . &quot;
because this is a big part of it . there are layers behind every photograph .
but they basically took me a promise .
or , &quot; how can we help . &quot;
if i think about the <unk> , and what they &apos;re doing is , i think there &apos;s a few factors that i want to give you a lot of factors that i want to give you a <unk> .
they have a trend .
zipcar started a decade ago , in the year 2000 .
it &apos;s called <unk> . cities have been going to be <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s very effective , and it &apos;s very <unk> .
the last 40 years were extraordinary times .
and they also <unk> .
that would be <unk> <unk> .
it &apos;s important that the most of ted <unk> ideas , ideas that we think about , after the end , and make sure that this is a particularly brilliant century , and not one of the <unk> and <unk> .
my homework family are unhappy <unk> , which is going to be able to collect <unk> of <unk> for our <unk> .
i said , &quot; i &apos;m here to meet the prime minister . &quot;
i thought he was crazy , but something was really <unk> .
i was sitting in , just like you here , in the audience .
this is another picture .
so , since we <unk> my career , it &apos;s a lot of success .
i began to explore the <unk> <unk> of human <unk> .
i said , i said , let &apos;s try something else .
so i said , &quot; okay . &quot;
sw : much better . einstein &apos;s very surprised here at ted 2006 in ted 2006 between all of the things that i &apos;m going to be doing is , in fact , it &apos;s very excited .
it would be very dangerous if you write out .
sw : no , i don &apos;t have a problem . you &apos;ve got the problem , remember ?
sw : big last .
sw : what about a <unk> ?
my parents thought this is important for their internal sick .
if i &apos;ve got a platform , it &apos;s things that i &apos;ve been able to take out apart from which i have <unk> <unk> .
the body has a higher density than the water , at least 95 percent of the body , from itself under itself .
and this is going to get it very far .
i asked him what that means .
in this point , you can imagine , if you want to get several languages , and they &apos;re going to take them out without all kinds of languages .
and she looked up to me , and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s better . &quot;
i think you &apos;re listening to me that they look very well .
and i &apos;ve done with 50,000 students with about 50,000 students , so about a half six dozen schools , my readers , by the way .
we found out -- and we were in very many things wrong , and we were able to get it out -- but we found that the young people were loved it .
<unk> <unk> : a little introduction to the <unk> <unk>
and finally , the only person , the <unk> , a young shepherd , and he goes to sound , and he says , &quot; i &apos;m going to fight it against him . &quot;
there are the <unk> , men and <unk> .
goliath is easy . he doesn &apos;t have a chance . he doesn &apos;t have a chance .
so goliath is to be bigger than <unk> , and usually there is a explanation for that if someone was so far outside the norm .
and i think it &apos;s a very important lesson for all of us .
and it turns out that we &apos;ve been through a <unk> , and these microbes are doing all of us well , rather , instead of killing us .
they &apos;ve got all of the microbes , and they used to be able to be able to be able to be able to go into the <unk> .
most pills , or the <unk> that you can eat , there &apos;s one or two , maybe five species , and the human community has thousands of species of species .
we need a <unk> for the microbes that are in and on people living in the world , so we can understand what they &apos;re doing in our lives .
a lot of people think about the internet is very <unk> , but for us , it &apos;s truly global . we &apos;ve got it in many , many languages .
and when she looked at him about a ridiculous change on the side of me , they would probably thought that it was just going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s a social concept of cooperation , we don &apos;t talk about truth and mathematica .
and we have about 40 <unk> , 40 <unk> .
it &apos;s not perfect rule , but it &apos;s enough for the beginning .
and i want to say that it &apos;s also the only person who knows most of the rules of wikipedia , about ...
it seems to me , as most people who are used to be used to education of our children , from nature .
in switzerland , in <unk> , in <unk> , is a temple .
it &apos;s not an famous <unk> american prime minister in <unk> , and this is what it is : it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s like this .
it &apos;s far under their cognitive <unk> .
we found activity also in other <unk> -- in <unk> that with the theories of profit and loss .
i &apos;ve got a friend who &apos;s just a terrible <unk> .
and i said , i don &apos;t know .
we &apos;re using each other , and we think we &apos;re going to talk to each other , and we &apos;re talking about it .
people like looked like , knife , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , who i had in a green school .
i had a long time , and i was never going to end up in my head .
in some <unk> , they &apos;re going to give tools a lot of <unk> to <unk> .
and so we can <unk> , and they can <unk> out of the distance .
look at what they &apos;re doing with their partner and the other <unk> .
but we found fast out that free particles don &apos;t just look like a boat in a keyboard .
this dolphin we called &quot; <unk> , &quot; because it &apos;s about 12 <unk> <unk> .

because this event was the scientific revolution since the knowledge of the physical world , and how we can adapt to our need to adapt our needs , <unk> in the growing .
by the way , why don &apos;t we do that ?
it &apos;s based on <unk> , our head on the bible . &quot;
there &apos;s something like a <unk> story .
and only if one explanation is good , it &apos;s also important that you can see them .
<unk> are not very expensive . they &apos;re pretty <unk> .
it &apos;s actually used about 30,000 from them .

first of all , we &apos;ve been working together , we &apos;re working together , and we &apos;re working together .
one call in the united states , after canada , or china costs five <unk> , or <unk> u.s. dollars .
it &apos;s built <unk> , so that you can also be able to be able to do a <unk> , and so that &apos;s also about remote places .
in the time , the buildings were higher and bigger our technology still better , so that the mechanical systems were enormous . they need big amounts of energy .
imagine , two americans travel together through italy .
now , you &apos;re all looking at all the time as a <unk> <unk> .
the best definition of <unk> that i know -- she explained so much -- comes from <unk> <unk> .
he allows us very , very , very old <unk> .
but look at the other three lines .
are it not just the foundation of <unk> and <unk> and <unk> ?
and she went down to <unk> , and they &apos;re always going to go .
and they say , &quot; look at your laws of my body . &quot;
and we &apos;ve got the sign of <unk> to the right , <unk> is the <unk> god -- and both work together .

and if you use them to use them , people are going to be <unk> , but they shouldn &apos;t be <unk> . &quot;
we &apos;ve been starting to organize makers in our <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> , or so something like something like this , or something like this .
and i &apos;ll tell you more about that , but just ...
but it also opened up here to other people who did the same as he did .
this is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and we need to bring it into schools , or in the communities of many , many ways -- the ability to create the world to form the world to form and form .
there &apos;s the glamour of physics .
and in fact , we see these <unk> photos of water all the time -- you call it <unk> .
it &apos;s not about one way , but you don &apos;t have to think of their world .
where i mean , that &apos;s from a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s glamorous .
but it will always be the illusion that if you buy this light , that if you buy this light , you &apos;re going to live in a world without sugar .

i see that <unk> <unk> like a <unk> challenge on my <unk> , and it <unk> me , because they were so slowly , and i wanted to be excited about it , and i wanted to be excited about it .
and so it took all his beginning , and they said , &quot; you can &apos;t build everything on a island , a part of this to be in the sahara , because we don &apos;t want to go from the community . &quot;
and i was working on it , and i didn &apos;t come up with this , because i felt that people who came from the historical museum , already with information , and if you can see a museum with information , you would not do it anymore .
when i flew back home , the <unk> was <unk> .
but you see the <unk> of the environment .
francis <unk> : the building of <unk>
and if he was sitting in a song -- play , for example .
so , in the lion , the <unk> is absolutely amazing .
it &apos;s not about , my vision <unk> or something like this .
i mean ? do i exist for you ?
they had to get a lot of <unk> to come here .
in summer , india is going to be extremely hot .
and the adults that comes after it is still one or two months .
i didn &apos;t know that , but i know it today . these are hundreds of <unk> .
this was a little bit curious . i hear this time , because i want to ask you , because i want to ask you , and here &apos;s a lot of people who &apos;ve spent their childhood .
so , at the next hand , i was at the telephone .
1990 , november , december . that &apos;s not the time of the <unk> monsoon .
okay , they put their eggs at the time of the <unk> lama , while the <unk> .
only last week , it was <unk> . the <unk> came , and now it rains there .
it &apos;s pretty incredible <unk> .
incredible . this is the <unk> script of a <unk> time . a pretty incredible script .
that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done from my life .
and everybody thought i was good . but on the new terrain , i was terrible . people said , &quot; oh , he &apos;s -- oh , it &apos;s -- oh , what &apos;s happened ? &quot;
and in night , i looked at my surgery , and i said , &quot; how are i going to do that ? &quot;
next -- oh , <unk> . these guys are the community .
so , i was pretty successful . and if you get all this thing , what &apos;s it , you know , what is it , you know , what &apos;s going to do this ? i &apos;ve told about the <unk> and other things , but what &apos;s going on ?
at my last tedtalk , about seven years ago , about seven years ago .
but charlie , in fact , was really <unk> the code .
whenever the norden bombsight goes into a plane , it &apos;s going to be <unk> by a series of <unk> .
the farmer <unk> on about three square square kilometers .
after the war , there was a <unk> -- as it was the army , as it &apos;s the army that &apos;s always done -- and they asked the question : how many of the <unk> we were actually destroyed ?
i &apos;ve described to you the opposite of a success .
a walk in a city , or one of these journey shows this diversity of human species on amazing ways .
we ask about the human <unk> .
but on what data is going on ?
imagine , you know , it would be <unk> .
it was a african where the global diversity of <unk> is based on <unk> .
the sahara was much bigger than today .
the people who are going to kill the animals that they were <unk> in the <unk> , and then , in fact , about 30,000 years ago , the earth in the middle east , in a rare <unk> phase of the sahara coast of the sahara .
the <unk> , <unk> on mars .
we know deep in our hearts that the universe doesn &apos;t move to complexity .
so we &apos;re going to go .
what you see here is that blue areas are about a <unk> degree than the red areas .
it &apos;s about smaller <unk> than gravity , which explains why they &apos;re , and i have smaller than the stars and planets .
they &apos;re going to be familiar with the <unk> of dna .
let me explain why .
in the last 200 years , there was something else .
you might ask yourself , &quot; what &apos;s talking about ? &quot;
we &apos;re not so good if it &apos;s about <unk> .
and then you have to decide how to invest in their <unk> choice , and they never heard about a <unk> .
first of all , a wonderful study has known .
but if you get the <unk> , you put the box if you don &apos;t want to kill the organs .
the other group will get two apples , one is going to be made .
more tomorrow is going to make it easy .
that &apos;s just one example .
it &apos;s a song about a so-called <unk> , a creature , which is a creature called a creature , which is a creature .
hello , who &apos;s because , please ?
thank you .
that knows a lot of influence on the <unk> .
i &apos;m trying to <unk> time .
so what did i do ?
we invent stories to explain our existence .
so what did they do ? they sent her to <unk> , to get their human part from their <unk> part .
do you have a child ?
elizabeth : <unk> you out there ! <unk> you out !
i went to a friend of mine , and he asked me in his <unk> in <unk> hill in <unk> hill in the 20th floor , a really very rich area in mumbai .
all of this is a <unk> .
we &apos;ve been from less than a dollar a day -- about 15 years ago .
and you &apos;ve got to use nuts from the <unk> to show that forests are more worth more value than <unk> . &quot;
he said , &quot; you don &apos;t see a person who says to sleep . &quot;
but it &apos;s not only about people ; it &apos;s about <unk> .
if you &apos;re all going to be sustainable planets , how can we be sustainable , how can we do this ?
coke has to work with pepsi .
these are nine of them .
at the end of the end , we were thinking , 60 percent of the global production in the table , and 25 percent of the <unk> .
that &apos;s not <unk> .
but they don &apos;t just buy the <unk> ; they also buy the carbon in the trees to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of the product to europe .
that &apos;s how the communication between the brain and the spinal cord , this leads to a full and <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> .
a few years ago , it &apos;s done to develop a <unk> <unk> , which is the nervous system of the engine of the spinal cord in a <unk> state .
we &apos;ve been working for 10 years hard to achieve this goal .
after a couple of weeks ago , we &apos;re going to put a <unk> pump to be able to be able to be able to <unk> a individual <unk> in the spinal cord .
and i was a kid .
he talked about the world of the world , like it is , &quot; and the world , as you should . &quot;
and by the way that they did , these women are many barriers from the way .
in the white house , and the table he sits on , called &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
last day , the woman came out there , and we talked about each other , and we talked about each other , and suddenly she said to me , &quot; would you go to me ? &quot;
and so , this <unk> is a <unk> to the voice , because it &apos;s ugly -- as you can see -- it &apos;s completely <unk> , and it &apos;s happened .
they didn &apos;t have it all .
so the internet takes the internet and instructions .
one of the most popular sides of the world that &apos;s going to be done from the most powerful company in the world , and there was nothing that youtube , or google , can be able to be able to do it .
and today , wikipedia is so <unk> that you can even find them on the maps of restaurants in china .
and that has understood wikipedia .
this is a blog called <unk> <unk> .
why ? well , there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> .
the world didn &apos;t end up in the &apos; 90s .
and we see that the influence of the <unk> in some countries are very , very strong .
all this costs money .
and it became a lot of time to ask students with <unk> or full of social families to give the same issues .
how are schools and teachers in the media ?
in <unk> , the teachers are going to be <unk> in the classes alone , and they &apos;re going to have a lot of <unk> .
some people say that the change of the <unk> is the <unk> of a <unk> .
but if you look at the problem from this perspective , you see what &apos;s happening in the last 60 years .
and i was about 15 kilometers across the entire morning to come to the <unk> .
so this was obviously a <unk> device .
we could be able to do this with phones .
so this is a business for them .
&quot; the government needs to be <unk> services . &quot;
it was even a long time ago when i was 24 years old , when i was 24 years old , at the beginning of st. kennedy in bangalore .
and you can see my map when i put it up here .
and i &apos;m going to make a invention with this .
now we &apos;re in the 1930s , and you see that japan through a time of war , with lower lifespan .
and they decided not only to invest in health and education , but we also started to invest the economy .
washington , d.c. went out .
not the bubble , not my <unk> , but the <unk> bubble .
would you really accept rich countries that are really able to accept , and the power of there , where it was in the last 50 to 100 years ago , from asia , over the last 50 to 100 years , come back to asia ?
the rest of the graph is a very emotional substance called &quot; dark energy . &quot;
but that explains the quality of all the mass , not .
and you &apos;re going to tell you the fact that we live in a three-dimensional universe -- a three-dimensional space .
again , this is a kind of <unk> model of what &apos;s going on in the <unk> .
they move out of each other , because the space is bigger .
because we look at things like galaxies -- their <unk> , how many of you are as a function of time -- can we get into experience , which is how dark matter and dark energy are working in the work to produce structures .
the big questions in physics .
how do you go to college boys : <unk> <unk> from ... new jersey ?
so , recycling and <unk> are <unk> here .
<unk> <unk> : 1.3 million reasons to invent <unk> .
and in fact , there was this change in the <unk> men in the united states during the 1980s .
it &apos;s a disease that kills a lot of adults in africa , and also many children .
in uganda , we see that the <unk> are happening .
this is really similar to a very similar <unk> .
but openness and connection has a price when we think about disease , that should not be surprise .
coffee is <unk> <unk> .
emily <unk> <unk> even the aids statistics in africa from a economic perspective , and comes to a surprising prediction : all our knowledge about the <unk> of hiv on the continent is wrong .
but i was fascinated by this , because i saw this kind of <unk> <unk> .
he was called &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; <unk> , &quot; because he was <unk> . but every time he went into a tunnel , he built a <unk> <unk> .
this <unk> goes on the water like a magnet .
and then we ask ourselves , why the layer of <unk> and why it &apos;s needed so much electricity .
for example , in the <unk> of <unk> in a material .
in <unk> <unk> , my <unk> , we &apos;re working with the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
janine <unk> : biomimicry in the way
&quot; yes , but why ? &quot;
we were four , not one , and we don &apos;t have young boys .
you can &apos;t do anything about it .
it &apos;s never going to happen in india , because that was now still , and never again .
they said , &quot; yeah . &quot; i said , &quot; well , let &apos;s say , &quot; well , let &apos;s ask you . &quot;
this was a <unk> for about 1,000 children in this jail .
secondly , it &apos;s about the <unk> movement in india .
so let me tell you about a project that we made a couple of years later , a kind of development of <unk> .
and basically , it &apos;s basically what you &apos;re going to do with a old book .
the number of sites that we &apos;re going to use , is actually that the number of words that we use per day is <unk> very , very large .
some of them are more fun .
at the time , the web is growing up in multiple languages .
and then my favorite thing comes from the question .
there &apos;s a way to put two , two fly with a <unk> .
but what &apos;s even more surprising is that we get out of the <unk> , even if you &apos;re just <unk> , the <unk> that we &apos;re going to get on is just the same way that we get out of the world &apos;s <unk> , and that &apos;s very surprising .
when they &apos;re learning value , they don &apos;t have to pay for money , they don &apos;t have to pay for money , they pay for their time .
the <unk> side , the company , is what they really can do .
<unk> <unk> is all the other than normal , it &apos;s all other than normal .
and zipcar offers a very <unk> , <unk> service , which works the amazing work .
for aristotle , happiness was the highest good , the goal , on all the other way .
maybe these people are right . it &apos;s probably not good .
10 percent of the time , the thought of ... ... you know , sex .
i was in the violent africans , african terrorists .
now , from the first <unk> , i didn &apos;t get a <unk> <unk> -- there was no one of the absolute majority -- so the elections were done in a second round three weeks later .
so here &apos;s a very interesting thing .
so i went to la <unk> , and i learned talking about it .
the people in the 17th century didn &apos;t really know how we think that this stuff is a bunch of different molecules , and that &apos;s how we <unk> it from a certain reason and so .
and so he said , charles , i &apos;m going to give money to give you a building , and you can ask you there , but i don &apos;t talk about religion .
reality is what you can see .
i thought everybody would be a little mind that would be done .
just to see what &apos;s going on when you put the two <unk> .
so i have something that &apos;s not happy .
if you want to be rich , i &apos;m going to get entrepreneurs .
they say , if you move to the temperature of the atmosphere , they &apos;re not going to be <unk> -- they &apos;re not going to be <unk> , and we &apos;re going to measure that for 20 years , very carefully , and they &apos;re not <unk> .
<unk> <unk> talks about the basis of modern science : the experiment . he told stories from the 17th century and <unk> of his own <unk> in the garden and <unk> the curiosity , inspiration and the sense of good science in all their forms .
i wanted to represent a simple way of a living body , which is this <unk> , <unk> rooms .
&quot; <unk> city &quot; is a <unk> for new york and &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , the <unk> and <unk> , which is made of the sense of <unk> in a urban environment .
i love to travel , and berlin is one of my <unk> .
and the whole time i &apos;ve seen was not a single rat on some of these places , until recently , when i was in the london &apos;s year .
the first question is , and maybe you write them down , either on a sheet of paper , and it &apos;s in your head , or on a <unk> sheet in your head , and , for the audience , you can also try to try to do this .
and we went out with , &quot; we &apos;re the best <unk> in the world , &quot; because of our british <unk> .
except that -- that -- you &apos;re <unk> -- now , on your <unk> , they thought , &quot; <unk> , what happens while the night ? &quot;
and one of the most important problems is , if people have a sense of how everything works , it &apos;s pretty difficult to change this .
and as a psychologist for <unk> chemistry , i have friends and colleagues that are different between the organic , <unk> world and the <unk> , <unk> world .
and you can see , it &apos;s <unk> , <unk> , in some way .
we even have amazing neurons that we can manipulate .
and darwin even asked in a letter to a colleague that life is probably going to be done somewhere in a warm little park -- maybe not in scotland , maybe in africa , maybe in africa , maybe somewhere else .
what is life ? what is this stuff of life ?
and we can connect them and literally thousands and thousands of thousands of <unk> molecules , in the same size like dna and proteins , but it &apos;s not the carbon in view .
we want to do it in the environment , and we want you to get their energy from the sun .
and i think if we can create <unk> biology and matter , it &apos;s going to be <unk> , then it &apos;s going to define life .
but there &apos;s another second reason that i like this <unk> : every single one can measure .
and these are very generous women who sit on a hour after a hour , and they &apos;re going to ask her <unk> questions .
i was actually sitting in friday in my computer , and i could see how the billions of gdp on this morning was <unk> .
as you know , these economists love the money , they want to get more and more and more .
as you can see , it doesn &apos;t make sense to make a number of <unk> , which was not , and this very quick progress .
but you don &apos;t talk about that much .
in which there were high , or very high , child mortality and the families were also very big , six to eight .
this is also <unk> .
what &apos;s always going to get more value for money .
yeah , i went <unk> , until i was 12 .
and he said to them , &quot; well , the <unk> of the question .
the whole time was a <unk> .
and <unk> , after my opinion , is going to make a difference to make a difference , not only for some small , but for each other .
b : the grandmother , yes , that would be hard ...
the <unk> -- it took about 10 years and 700 million dollars .
he said , &quot; the earth is enough to be familiar with poor needs to be poor , but not poor medications .
and <unk> die .
i went to high school .
when i was at the <unk> of scientific <unk> research -- 40 labs -- if you don &apos;t have two <unk> , i built a team .
they &apos;re going to come up with it , and now i &apos;ve got apps in the <unk> .
it &apos;s about making something old to protect something old in the 21st century .
it &apos;s still very hot , but not more <unk> .
but this is not going to be under a high pressure , and it &apos;s not such as <unk> , which means that the <unk> is not more important to get the <unk> .
i &apos;m convinced that the field that i designed here is to be an incredibly energy model that can be the great scientific projects with electricity , and i &apos;m really ready to do this .
we &apos;re moving around to a <unk> , where the experience is the actual product .
there is a <unk> that the <unk> of the case is that they &apos;re going to be in the woods .
and at the end of a long <unk> good clip , he says this : &quot; i mean , it &apos;s <unk> against you , he says this : &quot; especially , you know , <unk> against you .
you &apos;re not going to go to los angeles , but there &apos;s a place where you can walk a lot out , and there &apos;s a place where you can walk out a lot out in this city .
then they &apos;re going to be able to be wrong as <unk> , as a <unk> -- by using properties that they don &apos;t have .
when i was small , i was very <unk> , and i &apos;d like to do for me alone .
and then it &apos;s just about trying to start in a point , and then you put them down to the <unk> .
so i built it from concrete , because it &apos;s actually not true .
that was this tool .
and for me , this is the most important thing , because before i was a kid , i wanted to teach my passion and love .
so , days , the <unk> has evolved down 32 days : poor and hands are connected to 36 days : the primitive leg starts to use this weeks , in which the fetus is actually developed in the fastest .
the complexity of this in a single system is moving beyond every sense , or every time today , mathematics is mathematics .
because apparently , there &apos;s this <unk> <unk> <unk> , not in the atmosphere of <unk> stars .
so what can you do with these <unk> ?
recently , a colleague from berkeley , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , a email with a very interesting spectrum , and i said , &quot; can you look at this time ? &quot;
there are two ways -- about <unk> and <unk> stars -- on which matter and chemical elements in the universe and the universe will produce .
now , can you imagine that all the <unk> ?
now , imagine a object , an incredible object , or something that we can &apos;t explain , and we &apos;re just looking at it , and we &apos;re just going to say , &quot; well , we don &apos;t work . physics doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
and if we look at <unk> , and oxygen , then i think we have the perfect <unk> of the <unk> .
i just said , &quot; really ? &quot; and he said , &quot; absolutely . &quot;
what i can tell you is : it &apos;s awful ; we all have them .
i &apos;m just <unk> to <unk> , but this is another talk .
this led to a small <unk> -- -- that &apos;s actually , in fact , it looked like this .
and i said , &quot; but the thing is this : no <unk> , no <unk> . &quot;
what are you going to be able to be able to be vulnerable ? &quot;
i &apos;m right , you don &apos;t have right . listen .
we &apos;re going to do that , as we were doing what we &apos;re doing , not the impact on other people .
people <unk> their meals in twitter , the <unk> of their children on the iphone .
so if we think about it , you &apos;re going to use <unk> improvements , then we think about how they can be useful to our <unk> , for our <unk> and <unk> .
and today i want to talk about one of the things that we decided to do at the time , we wanted to find a new access to health care .
steven says his story . but it &apos;s not alone .
this is why the people say .
i also love this <unk> , but this was the only <unk> , which was going online and available .
and here we have a paper .
you don &apos;t have <unk> , you don &apos;t have data , that &apos;s not about scientific ways .
this is the curve about the <unk> .
but my brother didn &apos;t go to the end with him .
when we went from here today from the <unk> , we would go to something that <unk> 300 feet long , 120 miles long , 28 miles wide , and that &apos;s two <unk> .
to change the state , you need only two volts of a <unk> .
we said , &quot; can you build this ? &quot;
we can do better .
but there &apos;s a fascinating solution , which is what &apos;s called <unk> .
we &apos;re creating networks that are effective patterns of complex systems .
and it also has the impact on <unk> risk .
that &apos;s how we were able to have a <unk> .
we see the emergence of <unk> and <unk> programs that are changing in order to understand our <unk> world from the context of complexity .
<unk> has a <unk> capacity with <unk> <unk> -- except you use expensive filters and the <unk> .
and we had 500 of these <unk> .
it &apos;s human <unk> .
so we were at the bottom of our <unk> .
and this graph doesn &apos;t even mean something that &apos;s invented data .
and my brain starts to think very quickly , that this is a <unk> representation of <unk> in the world .
because this question shows that our external world can predict our <unk> world , and the truth is that i think only 10 percent of the <unk> of a person can predict , if i <unk> their entire <unk> world .
and this is from two reasons of biology <unk> and wrong around .
we &apos;re moving people , if you open up your <unk> , to write a positive email of the <unk> or the <unk> of somebody in their social environment .
so to say -- a <unk> , you understand -- my father was the <unk> man on the world .
and so i went out . i went on with it .
they said it &apos;s going to go .
they take a huge <unk> out of <unk> .
he was the first digital media <unk> in tokyo .
listen to this ? how cows ? this is in the morning at the morning .
so there are all these things to do , but most love i love to experience the world .
and i <unk> this with passion .
their culture is not going to be in schools , and i want to tell you how to make this problem .
so this is what it does , because girls don &apos;t want to go to schools who don &apos;t have boys .
and over little moments in my life .
or mothers who have a young <unk> ?
we need to change the <unk> of young in elementary school .
and you &apos;ve got the impression that you think that would be okay .
let &apos;s look at where this hypothesis is going to be .
is that a problem ? yes , a big problem .
we believe that this &quot; why &quot; <unk> evidence about the fundamental principles of nature .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m trying to do at the end of the end , and i &apos;m also excited whether it works .
and that was really an important lesson for me that you can &apos;t really make the object really .
we &apos;ve created a newspaper , for example , a normal newspaper .
it &apos;s <unk> with my ipad , and this is a software that &apos;s a software that &apos;s going on on the ipad .
so it &apos;s a digital sculpture , so i wanted to give you a <unk> , and i <unk> them to be a <unk> , so that the people in the glass are different , if you look at it .
and i &apos;m going to put it into a man in a student , and then i &apos;m going to put in a old man , and then in a old man .
<unk> <unk> has been allowed .
milo : what do you think about ?
fold down the wings , and they &apos;re going to take it back .
so i ask you another question .
and he took a <unk> <unk> , with <unk> , who had the instructions to <unk> him day and night , but with the secret premise , it doesn &apos;t work very well .
because they have found that <unk> of the human behavior is more <unk> .
yet , we have to create a <unk> <unk> , where you can create this kind of value of value , and it &apos;s also a lot of <unk> .
now , if we have all these tools , we have to ask us the question -- and torture and <unk> and <unk> have done this -- how to use these intelligent .
they &apos;re building the new <unk> .
they give small , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i felt , passion , soul and heart , had my body .
audience : no .
sb : no , not .
all around us , <unk> <unk> allows a different replicator in this <unk> of culture .
they probably bought them .
imagine the world full of brains and more memes as a place for them all there .
we &apos;re the only <unk> and <unk> .
i think that &apos;s the wrong approach .
that was dangerous , but hello .
they use us to create the resource of the planet to produce more and more <unk> , and another amazing things that we hear here at ted .
and are we going to see this third danger , how do we have the second and the first thing that we &apos;ve done ?
in collaboration with <unk> -- this is the <unk> in haiti -- with the center of public <unk> , with different <unk> , with different <unk> , we have more than 1,500 buildings .
it &apos;s not going to cost us more than we &apos;re doing it right . &quot;
and because i had <unk> in 70 percent of my body , the whole one was about a hour .
we also have found that it would have been good , you would have had been wrong with me from the pain to <unk> me from the pain .
and how bad would you be the punishment , if i was writing ?
it wasn &apos;t that the <unk> people -- the ones who have more obvious is <unk> -- fewer <unk> , and that the less religious -- those who had fewer religious -- those who had never been able to remind you -- more <unk> .
so if you don &apos;t think for a couple seconds for a couple of seconds , because you get a brand , it makes a difference ?
it &apos;s like this .
i think all of these forces are very bad effects on the food system .
but you can think of it . i &apos;m working in the <unk> .
these are the <unk> that i can show you today .
and suddenly , amazon is going to come up and <unk> with the <unk> , by how you want to spend their money , what money is and what it is .
maybe , is that a great thing that seems to be ?
in fact , i don &apos;t have to explain it -- last week , i had to explain it , and i had to explain it to me -- <unk> are structures that are <unk> by one individual to another .
and i knew that animals like the <unk> here , or even most of the animals , they don &apos;t stabilize their tissue by <unk> them by bones .
and that was that every <unk> that we &apos;ve found in nature who had found in nature that had found the same <unk> .
all of whom i showed that was really surprised .
a funny song about the global warming , of jill <unk> .
well , i &apos;ve got to think now .
all right , ok .
do we want to play a piece of play ?
<unk> , <unk> and <unk> , are the benefits of an amazing education .
the <unk> <unk> is completely made about that , and ben was to a <unk> .
it &apos;s about what &apos;s the activity of this character ?
i was forced to get my home to the democratic republic of congo , where i was <unk> .
but <unk> has been the <unk> of the united nations of the united nations on about 24 trillion dollars .
but we &apos;re not the goal .
they have to be very effective .
but could not have been done for this earth &apos;s <unk> ?
they were <unk> by the governments of governments , and in many cases , they also have to get them .
but let &apos;s take the goal of , our goal was to make new economic act on the basis of the pyramid of the pyramid .
because it has to have a whole bunch of these little directions to make their value to make their value .
he liked to sit on her lap because he said that it was painful for him to be in his own bed .
now , since <unk> , when sir <unk> <unk> , and the british society for <unk> , that &apos;s why the sun seems to be .
so , what is collaboration ? here &apos;s something like this .
and this energy is it &apos;s called the design .
so , just as a <unk> <unk> .
we need to make it a power .
but it &apos;s the largest arab country , and it &apos;s also one of a big impact .
now , they wanted to be the most of democracy , but they were the population of all the countries that the <unk> in the last month of the last month their opinion was only four percent -- it was only four percent .
but the expectations of the people who came up for their future .
so the question is to say , &quot; what are the male support for women ? &quot;
i promise you , she read the message .
nobody can listen to them , they just send quiet a text .
you could see the most important effects of the laws , or the one of the <unk> speech on a <unk> , and you see what &apos;s going on as a result .
the flight took 12 seconds , and he was about 35 .
this is <unk> for a rocket .
it weighs less than a <unk> .
and the most <unk> to the <unk> forces of nature of nature .
we can afford to be able to afford individuals , and we &apos;re going to pay for them .
we believe that somebody else , somebody <unk> , someone <unk> , someone with more means to solve this problem .
we didn &apos;t <unk> him in the pacific .
it took 10 free prototype , until we had something that was really published .
and so there &apos;s one side of these incredible <unk> , which is possible , and this enormous seriously is what that means .
and let &apos;s think about our moral .
and the director was pretty <unk> , and he said to me that he was mad , and he said to me , &quot; this place is a <unk> . these guys are very sophisticated .
it needed several other events , until i found what i should do .
when i started with this program four years ago , my <unk> plan to create a <unk> .
and they look at <unk> , everything is so small and tiny .
i feel blessed and happy that i had been the courage to leave my hometown to life , and in my own home , where i &apos;m going to leave these incredible projects with this group of <unk> children from ethiopia , <unk> and russia can do .
and as many times , my self would have to die before i would understand that it &apos;s not there ?
and i was really good <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> , these insights don &apos;t be my <unk> <unk> , this feeling of the <unk> .
that was because i didn &apos;t have any self , which was in between .
imagine what kind of existence we might have , if we have the <unk> death of the self , the privilege of life , the privilege of life and look at what &apos;s going on as next .
and this is a <unk> on the ocean in britain .
but instead of looking at that look at what we &apos;re doing .
we also discovered that the way a <unk> structure and a <unk> way through this structure would be made by this structure .
but we found that seeds -- this is really important project -- but that seeds -- but that seeds -- in the leading of <unk> crops , seeds are not <unk> .
we &apos;ve been working with a <unk> , to develop a <unk> of <unk> , so , even if you &apos;re <unk> , it &apos;s kind of <unk> and <unk> , the piece of landscape that you see here .
it &apos;s actually just the first couple of <unk> that you know , and the rest of the rest is only for postcards .
the book is called the title of the piece , the most importantly , the most important thing that the human mind is a <unk> sheet , and all his structure from his <unk> , culture , education and experience <unk> .
well , there &apos;s a series of political reasons that they like to ask the people good .
it &apos;s still not clear if this <unk> is <unk> , but unfortunately , it seemed to be able to stabilize the <unk> of this .
another one of the <unk> and <unk> on the universities that are actually in <unk> , are actually in the favelas .
well , the other hot iron iron is the <unk> .
and i think you can &apos;t tell you better .
i also call <unk> , just like <unk> , and you don &apos;t like it , but you don &apos;t like it .
there is no script , there &apos;s no script , there &apos;s no script .
he says , &quot; a day . &quot;
i don &apos;t like what i think i think . &quot;
oh , i live in a computer program -- that &apos;s strange .
so i asked myself what was going to happen if we &apos;re doing some of these <unk> <unk> .
right ?
it &apos;s the same thing -- we &apos;ve told the heart of the war as a society , every one of us .
their iphone without the people who are the same skin , same circuits , same <unk> , the same keyboard , always and again .
and then it was always <unk> and <unk> , and now it &apos;s <unk> pages long .
and i said to brian , &quot; what did tony do ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , is it true that you &apos;ve got in there ? &quot;
but how do you look at a stable normal way ?
so , all the things that happened to me in the <unk> of the <unk> , evidence that he was in this new way that he was going to be mad in this new way .
he came up in <unk> , and <unk> 30 percent of the age , <unk> american cities just looked like this in <unk> .
and i put it down , &quot; i &apos;ve got a list of <unk> properties in my pocket .
and the <unk> are always the extreme aspects of the personality of the <unk> .
like that , that was two years ago , and that &apos;s where my book ended .
in fact , the trend of the rest of the world was on the rest of the world .
and as a result of this <unk> , it &apos;s very , very difficult to say , very difficult to say , i <unk> the real islam . &quot;
it likes to be a big war between the east and west <unk> , and that it was in the design of democracy against communism .
and even though the president , from <unk> reasons , very , very , very good , i &apos;ve met that islam is not the enemy to call a natural impulse to call the other side as the enemy is to call the other side as a enemy .
when the queen was in 2000 , you &apos;ve heard about the peak of the best <unk> that the scientists of african penguins had ever been <unk> -- that happened to this time as a <unk> form .
at the day after our time , two of us were two of us on the <unk> of the room of two <unk> . room two , more than 4,000 penguins with oil <unk> penguins .
we &apos;ve got this method in the audience still used to use .
and that &apos;s really important because the african colleague was inspired by a year in a <unk> way .
on the <unk> year , in the <unk> year , the <unk> , a <unk> , in the <unk> , and even the police of the police .
people are free for the <unk> .
so we started this campaign -- very <unk> -- &quot; every egg , &quot; every egg . &quot;
this is not the <unk> of the second grade .
these teach <unk> <unk> , abstract .
eric said to a leg , and she said , &quot; what you &apos;re going to do is don &apos;t do your neighbors . this is the <unk> . the rest of the rest of the rest of it .
now , that &apos;s not the whole story .
and <unk> is <unk> <unk> , and it takes him closer to her father , and the two men see each other , and you can see each other as a <unk> .
this is what the cells of the cells have me really in the biology and science , which is looking at living cells in the microscope .
each sand has a size of a typical millimeter .
you can see these <unk> .
this picture was the beginning of <unk> .
we &apos;re all looking at the same part of the inside , you believe me .
the walls are from 700 euros thick , <unk> concrete .
and this is the bottom of the left .
it has human <unk> .
and in the graph , we see all the little <unk> in the edges .
i had to get the car in the middle of the middle of the middle , you know , no simple challenge .
yeah , you &apos;ve got 12 monkeys for a week , and after this week , they &apos;ve been using it just as a toilet .
the science is actually saying that we &apos;re going to live forever .
no , i <unk> a <unk> .
for me , it &apos;s a very , very important thing .
thank you . thank you .
how do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? maybe we &apos;re all not talking about it .
not professor and <unk> , only two instructions , ready to <unk> .
and at that time , my life was fine .
all i saw in order was that it was the right <unk> between the <unk> of the <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> .
would we have time to process the information ?
we &apos;ve spent a lot of time to study a hundred billion dollars , and you hear it right now -- to explore a billion <unk> <unk> , in which he was born , and what we found was shocking , but it &apos;s almost more .
then there &apos;s dan <unk> .
we were told that these companies were quickly <unk> their <unk> <unk> , and the most important in london <unk> , and the most important in london was very <unk> .
that &apos;s too complex and hard to change it .
we &apos;re all going to die . we &apos;re all going to be sick . we &apos;re all sick . people are waiting for us .
there are places that you can &apos;t be able to think of what you can &apos;t think of the worlds that you can &apos;t expect .
they have a <unk> , and a freedom of which i believe is that they &apos;re the foundation of a new <unk> .
they &apos;ve met the decision to get <unk> or <unk> , but your life that doesn &apos;t happen that this is not going to happen to the other girls .
we &apos;re all refugees .
but you put this thing on the head of the head , and then this thing happens .
but it doesn &apos;t do it . &quot;
i &apos;ve got michael michael .
he didn &apos;t even found it , and his employees didn &apos;t have it , and they said , &quot; you &apos;re going to go to the <unk> , or you &apos;re going to go , &quot; you &apos;re going to go back and die . &quot;
nm ! we meet her , the <unk> poem . let &apos;s put them down .
if it &apos;s on the box , which is the <unk> , then it &apos;s the way that it is .
the characteristics that the word is <unk> is so often in adults to see that we should get the age of <unk> word when it comes to the way that we should be able to be able to make behavior that with <unk> and <unk> thinking .
now , when i got the ability of my sister , the 10 percent of my sister that i &apos;m going to do on her last diplomat , i &apos;m going to get your ability to get more money from me to get it back to me until she had paid it back to it .
it &apos;s why we don &apos;t live in the dark times .
and the third is all the sounds that we create people , the <unk> .
this is after <unk> <unk> .
there are a lot of <unk> from <unk> , under other ways , like animals , like animals , and they taught us that i &apos;ve been <unk> for a different time .
so this was extremely embarrassing .
and if you wonder how much that is , this <unk> here are 16 times .
so , in fact , we have our <unk> .
it &apos;s very impressive and a very beautiful beach .
and these are the issues that we &apos;re actually in the heart .
one generation that &apos;s so much more meaning from video games than the real world .
all of these are problems outside of my <unk> .
i &apos;m not sure what the future of video games is for our civilization .
end ! let me end ! that was .
he would love that right now .
so , you get quickly over the simple to the complex , if you make more power . that &apos;s what we like .
and then you put them down , and that &apos;s <unk> -- i thought , at least a long time , until she explained to me , that &apos;s how to think about it , that &apos;s how to think about it .
it &apos;s going to go into the other direction .
girl : there were a signal and a <unk> , because it &apos;s two completely different <unk> , and when you go to the same time , you &apos;re going to get <unk> .
but we couldn &apos;t get a thousand new teachers to save our lives .
and it &apos;s about a <unk> . &quot;
at the end of all , we &apos;re going to take ourselves as much as we &apos;re changing the world around us .
this is going to have incredible implications .
why do you do what they do ?
everybody would want to do the new version .
they &apos;re going to make us very much .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> about this time .
i &apos;m going to put his words back into the evidence .
&quot; well , yeah , &quot; i said , &quot; strange , i said , &quot; strange thing .
it &apos;s like , &quot; you don &apos;t need to do again . &quot;
we looked at us , and i was grateful , because she just said , &quot; wow ! that &apos;s obvious . &quot;
the goal of the project is just easy .
this is completely <unk> medicine in <unk> .
now the answer is a <unk> team .
i work with the <unk> and the <unk> , which have some serious problems in the project , problems that we should not have .
in the medicine , there are so many people who don &apos;t want to change change , not , if a <unk> engineer , the answer is more .
you can find really new solutions that hasn &apos;t been seen before , and that &apos;s very quickly and simple .
yeah , good , you &apos;ve been <unk> my life , because <unk> had been around , of beautiful <unk> form .
no , but it &apos;s true : the internet has changed the world .
you know the story .
and i met the <unk> .
and i didn &apos;t ask them to draw a nice <unk> .
thank you .
so , &quot; our hot earth , &quot; i &apos;ve got a lot about the meeting with the audience in the audience .
we &apos;ve got a lot of time for the existence of animals on this planet than they &apos;ve been here than they &apos;ve been here to be here until we &apos;ve done the second microbial era .
his impact is the distribution of this very thin <unk> across the entire planet , and we had a very <unk> death of dinosaurs , and we had a very <unk> death of the dinosaurs , <unk> here , and <unk> around here and so much else .
it &apos;s the <unk> , the <unk> of his time .
they hate animals .
this is when material comes from the top of the earth and the surface is coming out of the surface of the planet .
i &apos;m <unk> from the coast of the coast , what will happen to me ?
they have a crash . they &apos;ve got two possibilities : they &apos;re going to die , or they take the hydrogen efficiency , and they say 75 percent of them is going to be killed .
<unk> : <unk> and <unk> .
some of them are countries who are thinking that the <unk> , or even not the <unk> of the best way to create investments .
the answer is easy : the chinese define these factories as chemical businesses , not as <unk> , and you don &apos;t look at it .
i don &apos;t know what we can do , but i can use my favorites to use them all together to develop a solution . &quot;
they need a <unk> environment .
now , we &apos;ve got the impression that it &apos;s about the beginning of a new way and a way of <unk> international tasks .
brains are going to be a very simple question : can i do that people would be married ?
or perhaps to find the young , which was to the beginning of the fire to see if you can change it . &quot;
okay , right ? go on .
i was fire and <unk> .
again , and again , we looked at how the spoken poetry walls .
after the fight , he said his <unk> , <unk> hair and said , &quot; you &apos;re a god . &quot; no , sarah , you &apos;re the god . &quot;
i trip too much , if i teach myself , and i don &apos;t get to see how my students get your third step , but i had <unk> happiness to see that their journey was so , as they did .
my parents were called sarah , which is a <unk> name .
i want to talk about some of the ideas that i &apos;ve invented me to be a <unk> .
when i saw that the war for each of the people who had so incredibly <unk> consequences , and that the <unk> was actually a factor in the <unk> , i wanted to be a photographer to be a photographer to be a <unk> .
at the same time , in south africa , after nelson mandela came out of jail , the black population was taken out of jail , the black population was the last phase of liberation .
in the next day , i made myself in rwanda , and it was , as i was in the <unk> of the hell .
after the <unk> of <unk> in indonesia , i started to explore the conditions of poverty in a country that was in a country that was <unk> .
a hospital of the doctor &apos;s &quot; doctors without borders , &quot; in a refugee camp .
the <unk> is so efficient that the percentage of the soldiers who survive a <unk> survive in this war is much higher than in each other in our history .
to make sure that as little as possible as possible as possible , we have all these materials on the choice of choice .
so , you &apos;re going to take it out .
but this is a <unk> and pretty hard subject , so i had to be able to do this .
the size of the population -- here &apos;s big china , there &apos;s big india , there &apos;s big india .
and in all east asia , in all east religions was the level of the same .
because the death of a child is going to be <unk> with another child .
and what is the reason in scotland ?
they have a great <unk> .
all religions across the world are able to be able to avoid their values , and they &apos;re able to adapt to this new world .
and then , like all other other of our generation , we lived in a <unk> .
five .
in india , my <unk> best friends , and i went from door to the door with this same image , to every single house in india . we made about a billion <unk> .
this is the <unk> .
i asked them -- it &apos;s all <unk> -- and i asked them these questions that they want to ask them .
and i think we were <unk> by the <unk> and ron st. john , and i hope , ron is somewhere in the audience -- there &apos;s over the audience -- it &apos;s over here -- it &apos;s the founder of <unk> .
larry brilliant : when the first , they &apos;re not angry because of the <unk> of <unk> ?
there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> , &quot; the climate group group . &quot;
why should we have a positive influence on the world , in the world , as a company ?
they save 85 percent of electricity with a explosion that had used to be used with a old orchestra bulb .
sometimes people think 100 percent are pretty hard , and we had this conversation in business .
a <unk> had paid to be in seven or eight years .
now , in the <unk> , in the <unk> , there are 47 percent women , but that &apos;s not enough , and we want to look at this gap , and we want to look at this gap , and this way to be able to follow this way to the high .
there was a equation in my family , about this : if you &apos;re intelligent , you &apos;re not <unk> .
this is , &quot; he wrote , &quot; is the <unk> structure of reality . &quot;
someone that &apos;s talking about it , or that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , or that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do with the ears of the ears .
so , at the end of our <unk> , we found the openness of the other .
as soon as i would go back to bangalore , and often to <unk> discussions in my friends , where we &apos;ve been talking about different issues as they were <unk> about new <unk> , where a drop is often more than what she costs to her 14 years old .
he &apos;s looking for forgiveness , and he said that he wants to try to improve the life of his family .
this <unk> seemed pretty happy to be happy , and it didn &apos;t have a <unk> , even though dozens of <unk> in liberia were killed .
and how are we responsible for that ?
it &apos;s interesting -- not ? -- that the media of the world is able to make a bad job that a little group of activists in the world is able to go more from this kind of information than the rest of the <unk> together .
j yeah . this was the title in the guardian , and it was around in all countries around kenya , in the <unk> and south african press .
j the implications of the people who worked on it was 350 .
and there are very many information .
i was interested in what we &apos;ve heard -- i &apos;m curious about what we &apos;ve heard -- i &apos;m curious about the point of ted audience .
and we said , &quot; oh , tell us more .
so you &apos;ve got to be careful with the term .
and only one month ago , all of a month ago , that &apos;s all about <unk> <unk> .
and from all these numbers , i &apos;m going to start with only two or three variables .
this piece of here can be very different , depending on where you &apos;re going to <unk> it .
at least , i read about this in a <unk> <unk> , and that &apos;s what i was going to do with the <unk> for productive medicine and seven <unk> .
so because of that discovery is the best <unk> for a chicken , it doesn &apos;t go to the very short time , but with security , not too long , until it becomes black , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> sugar .
and then in the next summer , i was working under the <unk> of dr. <unk> at the <unk> , texas .
and this insight is incredibly incredible for the efficiency of partnerships , maybe for many different cancers .
for example , <unk> <unk> are chemical <unk> , which is going to be found in our schools , trying to be found in the workplace .
because all these solutions are , of course , they &apos;re sustainable and they &apos;re <unk> -- <unk> for our generation and for the following generations .
and immediately , a voice says , &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
after the conference , after my talk , people came back to me , men and women .
fun .
it &apos;s not one . it &apos;s not the need for the need , a lack of <unk> .
we &apos;re all different from different perspectives .
i was in the way out of the <unk> games for the <unk> games .
about 80 percent of these <unk> are young people , under 30 percent .
and they &apos;re in most unemployment , <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the banks , <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> from europe and america of products that they produce .
they have a kind of choice that you can see on a piece of chicken or fish , and it looks like <unk> .
people think about the following question : are we going to take our environment further from a higher gdp ?
there &apos;s nothing to eat , but the conditions were ideal for the <unk> .
now , the series was not even <unk> , so they &apos;re the first thing to see this .
mars is similar to mars than the earth , it seems to be the same <unk> .
in fact , fear was afraid that we have the opportunity to get out of this , quote , &quot; <unk> , &quot; they would take us .
but a lot of more important was that muslims used to be used to be able to create new <unk> , which is <unk> for free to their clients , and then in the year , as <unk> with a <unk> of <unk> , the majority of the <unk> , the majority of the <unk> .
and i ...
for the <unk> , for me , i &apos;m trying to talk as a good <unk> , of course , is to ask something from the government to desire . a mistake , isn &apos;t it ?
this insight is <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
okay , i don &apos;t want to do that , but i &apos;ve just noticed that the person right next to you is a <unk> .
&quot; oh , you don &apos;t see it out , no . no . &quot;
so another study showed that strangers three times in the first 10 minutes of your hometown .
here &apos;s <unk> with your <unk> .
i &apos;m going to say it again .
now , don &apos;t look at evidence in the eyes .
we say , &quot; yes , as we shake the head .
the science has been able to get a lot more <unk> in the <unk> .
look at right , and they &apos;re going to see the <unk> smile .
in this way , there &apos;s so much <unk> world can be useful for us to be a little bit more <unk> in terms of our moral principle .
and that &apos;s true , isn &apos;t it ?
you know , we often think that language is the world that we live in the world that we live , but that &apos;s not true .
so what &apos;s going on as a <unk> , if not even tragic joke about harry , <unk> , <unk> as <unk> .
six months after that , without any explanation , without any explanation , they took me free .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m thinking about .
when i was 10 , i said james <unk> &quot; <unk> country , &quot; and on this book i was <unk> .
and a new song i was asked you .
so i took some time to study coke .
and in the remote areas of africa , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
how do you give them to the implications of the effects that they have to act on these remote villages ?
so , i don &apos;t love to be like <unk> <unk> .
they &apos;re waiting for that .
a lot more people would have been <unk> .
today , i &apos;m going to tell you two things . first of what we &apos;re lost , and secondly , how to use it .
this is where you can see the biggest part of the world &apos;s <unk> of florida .
if there &apos;s no crops , because it &apos;s <unk> , or <unk> , it &apos;s great .
after a few years , after five to seven years after five to seven years , the fish come back , and then they grow the algae .
you can see the border of the <unk> , because there are the united states all the <unk> .
if it &apos;s so good , if it &apos;s so simple , how much is it ?
so , the protection of the <unk> and the oceans are used to be more <unk> by governments and <unk> institutions , and that &apos;s not clear .
and in the coral reefs , we &apos;ve found that the pyramid is that the pyramid of <unk> , where five lion comes to a <unk> .
okay , <unk> , i thank you that you &apos;ve got a part of your spiritual experience . thank you .
it turns out as the highest creatures in the ocean .
they come up to <unk> -- they come to the eyes of the window , and you &apos;re going to go to the <unk> .
in other ways , we &apos;re trying with our partners in the woods , this virtual world -- this virtual world -- this is the world , to get this <unk> area -- to get into the lab .
bl : these worms don &apos;t have <unk> . they don &apos;t have your mouth .
what we &apos;ve seen was from the pacific .
we &apos;re going to try to show you the pacific <unk> .
these worms grow several centimeters in the week .
the concept of <unk> is <unk> .
and the rest of one percent is <unk> after the formula that they can use in the situation .
they also have the mathematical structure that &apos;s about <unk> , measurements , <unk> , dots , <unk> , and i &apos;m talking about it .
the students have to make this <unk> . they have to make them care .
and the best thing , or one of the best parts , is that we don &apos;t get the answer of the <unk> on the end of the <unk> .
what about the small hadron collider happens ?
this is what you see in the fastest , in the middle of the world .
it &apos;s <unk> . there is no government schools in the slums .
this is a computer , which was in the interface to come to their slum , from a <unk> social <unk> , who showed the <unk> experiments , who showed that children under some of the things that have shown that kids can learn with the help of a computer .
well , the key is motivation , and that &apos;s in two ways .
this is a school in a bus on a plane on a model in <unk> , which is the fastest <unk> city of asia .
it should turn it into a mcdonald &apos;s .
there are <unk> , schools , <unk> , hospitals , hospitals , in which innovation can happen , and <unk> environments , communities , social networks .
every child until the age of 15 , for the age of 15 , that &apos;s a place in a school , is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get one .
and while i look at it , this scene , that scene , that i think i &apos;m <unk> to tears , and i &apos;ve been <unk> with me for 25 years .
here &apos;s a couple of parents from teenagers ? all of you have to cook for them -- and they have to cook every night for two , three or four or four . it &apos;s ridiculous .
he goes around all over the time , and it &apos;s all about it .
these <unk> , people like i want to be treated as full citizens , and it &apos;s right now in the time of our nose .
now , people have to fear of their job , so you don &apos;t show who you &apos;re going to go back to home , and it &apos;s not only about north carolina ; in all states without one , it &apos;s <unk> .
think about that .
and i was afraid .
about three years ago , i read a article in the new york times .
who were my grandparents ?
it helps us to become what we could be .
that &apos;s how evolution works .
and actually , here &apos;s this insect .
i &apos;ve been <unk> by one of somebody .
he doesn &apos;t only <unk> for 43 to 44 degrees of c for about two days , but it doesn &apos;t have a real temperature .
but the contrast is going to be like this . it &apos;s about the background of the background .
this is where americans are the russians , and yes , it was -- actually -- a game .
she started to tell me about this , and all parents are going to see the <unk> .
i &apos;ve got a <unk> <unk> .
our lives will be <unk> by data , and the presentation of this data is for us to create a chance to create fantastic vehicles that are great stories .
i also have a look at the different <unk> , because you can choose what you want to share from the data .
it &apos;s a <unk> man who &apos;s sitting in the box , and it &apos;s going to control this <unk> .
one <unk> from about 11 feet per hour , which is a <unk> of 26 cents .
in the reason , you can see -- what you see on the left is the <unk> , and on the right side , you can see the <unk> of 16 people who didn &apos;t have the idea of 16 people who didn &apos;t know what they do .
in alexander bell : <unk> , <unk> -- and we took all these individual pieces , and we took all these individual pieces and <unk> them into a different mechanical <unk> .
but we knew that we needed to get the right person to ask us the right person to ask us , and we could build something like this .
and under all of the individual <unk> , people who <unk> people in the project .
thank you .
so i made <unk> of images , <unk> , and we put them in <unk> together .
so , a <unk> consequence is that you &apos;re always going to see one part of his image , and that leads to a very free field .
and sometimes i have a emotional reaction on news , like the earthquake in haiti in 2010 .
then i went 50 miles , four kilometers .
it &apos;s like the different layers of whom we &apos;re doing , and what we &apos;re doing is to talk about the world as our identity .
another <unk> is in a public library in san <unk> , california .
so every building has its own personality .
it &apos;s often easier than ever before , to make a good <unk> .
i don &apos;t think we &apos;re particularly <unk> .
it &apos;s just too strange .
you know , in the middle ages , in england , if you met somebody who was very poor , you called this one &quot; <unk> . literally , somebody who was lucky , the destiny was not <unk> : a <unk> .
and this is what he &apos;s going to do in the youngest court with pain and <unk> , and the sky is going to open up .
i told them the action of <unk> <unk> .
what i think i was really talking about is success and failure .
we should make sure that it &apos;s our fact that we &apos;re really the <unk> of our own <unk> .
charlie de <unk> : a <unk> , <unk> <unk>
if you train for these <unk> , you don &apos;t smile .
you know , you &apos;re going on with <unk> shoes , and you &apos;re going to get 60 trains per minute , so you &apos;re never going to be able to do something like that , you don &apos;t see it good .
they &apos;re in the liquid <unk> .
my breath is down to three <unk> the minute .
it should be worried about me , i didn &apos;t do it for them .
i swam with this thing .
it &apos;s the only <unk> that i &apos;m interested in .
this is already today .
the <unk> can be a smartphone , or it might be a particularly <unk> <unk> , like today , many of these things are special <unk> , because they &apos;re not so good .
many of you have to get the <unk> life .
this is an important part of our lives . we should sleep a third of our lives .
ok . let &apos;s go to thousands of sleep .
so , we can change medicine in <unk> , in all ages , from <unk> or <unk> children to the <unk> , the entire spectrum of the disease , the entire spectrum of the disease -- i hope to give you a sense of -- about the globe .
so , i hope that i &apos;ve convinced you know -- the implications of the <unk> are enormous and the implications of diseases are also amazing in all these different diseases and more .
how do we create ecological societies ? longevity .
and in the novel , a certain called <unk> , and he says , maybe it &apos;s not the best way , and it &apos;s destroyed the entire system .
and so they wouldn &apos;t be <unk> .
and it &apos;s a great thing .
<unk> should be faster .
maybe you ask how to do this <unk> .
this is the only <unk> of the world , in the <unk> <unk> .
this is the work <unk> .
a talk about surgical robots is still a talk about surgery .
and surgeons were more <unk> than doctors .
but finally , it &apos;s also <unk> .
they had to give their efficient movements with the instruments .
i &apos;ve told you about the big , complicated robots .
and as you can see how it comes out there to do something useful , it can &apos;t stay like this .
and we don &apos;t have to have to be able to do this <unk> .
we &apos;re here to talk about accidents .
but we had a problem .
okay , well , it was part of my taste .
we don &apos;t only have shown that bacteria can be the solution for plastic , but also that the openness is <unk> , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re allowed to do is <unk> the relationship of risks .
the film that we &apos;re going to see is that they &apos;ve done for the <unk> in new york .
i &apos;m not an exception .
it went on . they &apos;re always trying to make things better .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style are curves . let &apos;s make the house <unk> . &quot;
i think in my family , we had a lot of happiness , because we learned design .
<unk> , very good .
ed : and then <unk> hours is actually an amazing <unk> , and there in the <unk> story , the <unk> story , in the <unk> story , in the beginning of which the message was made .
you see this chair ? the <unk> ? this is the <unk> <unk> . <unk> .
because it &apos;s part of what we want to do .
it was <unk> full of truth . they were full of <unk> . they were <unk> . no abstract information .
one of them is known : the <unk> . the world &apos;s population , the world &apos;s population has almost seven billion people in the last 50 years .
nathan <unk> : nice here .
you can see the lines , as the <unk> is happening .
before i &apos;m talking about the cost of the cost , i &apos;ve got to be very clear that i &apos;m very clear .
this is actually what the explosion looks like .
but only since recently , we can do a lot of technological progress , now the <unk> and the <unk> .
first of all , some <unk> of <unk> in the inner , but the <unk> doesn &apos;t like when they move through the movements of energy , and that &apos;s how the <unk> <unk> .
and this <unk> , of course , is able to be able to create a <unk> ring .
and it was inspired by this quote by <unk> <unk> . the situation is from &quot; <unk> by the galaxy . &quot;
because they don &apos;t explain how to do it , if you want to do it yourself , you don &apos;t have a <unk> .
but even though they weren &apos;t convinced they said , &quot; okay , we call it back . &quot;
<unk> : yeah , i have .
so some of them will say , &quot; what &apos;s going to happen if moore &apos;s law &apos;s law ? &quot;
today , you can buy a half billion billion , and they &apos;re better , because they &apos;re faster .
but how are we going to get the software ?
and night , i &apos;ve got a strange speech on our <unk> , where he was <unk> , to ask these big challenges of humanity .
they wanted to start the fish .
it &apos;s like <unk> <unk> , but it &apos;s incredibly scary to hear that a lot of <unk> , bigger than the last thing to be in the same time , or maybe night , or maybe -- or maybe night , or maybe ...
this is how the tsunami can be seen as a kind of <unk> moment , a moment that was going to be <unk> .
in fact , it &apos;s about three to five percent of the number of <unk> in the glass , and it would be better than the rule of 90 to 95 percent of them .
somebody has <unk> , so it takes other other way , etc . , etc .
he died his <unk> , and i &apos;m waiting for a 200 pounds , and i &apos;m going to put on a 300 pounds , and he &apos;s just saying , &quot; that &apos;s all i want to say , &quot; that &apos;s all i want you to do . &quot;
so i &apos;m going to show you now about 30 seconds of the point of this thing without the skin , without the skin of it .
these are <unk> through the surface of the surface of the surface of the earth than all other other <unk> .
many of us , i &apos;m also thinking that the <unk> of the oceans of the oceans are only in the last 50 or maybe 100 years ago .
this is <unk> vehicles , our eyes are the eyes and hands for the work on the bottom of the bottom .
so there &apos;s a <unk> on this product that the computer was just told what the product is .
but i want to share with you some of my favorite discoveries .
we don &apos;t know why they do that , we don &apos;t know .
this graph is based on a <unk> article that &apos;s going to be <unk> in the year of <unk> biology .
but that &apos;s still not all the time .
as an architect , i &apos;ve been able to deal with something like this .
bruce <unk> : they don &apos;t build a house , they grow it .
and i think this is very interesting and very <unk> , because what you heard in the last days is the sense of being able to go into different directions : directions that are special and unique to the problems .
now , we all think that <unk> was obviously a big british poet , many of us forget that he was also written some wonderful <unk> , and the most famous <unk> is one called &quot; a <unk> of poetry . &quot;
i &apos;m going to read that .
and for a certain time , his life was <unk> on rocks .
but let me show you the latest <unk> .
if you were at the same time , the digital radio , the <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> , &quot; in which you heard , that was this noise .
the idea of <unk> <unk> is that you have two sources of terrorism , which is that you have two sources of information .
that means that i have to make predictions about the future .
well , there &apos;s a very clear example , where one of me would be <unk> by me as if he would be made by a different person , as if he was produced by one other person .
and in the meantime , i got two daughters .
so , they didn &apos;t know the rules that the other person is .
if these dots would be in a <unk> , they wouldn &apos;t have any sense of what &apos;s going on .
we &apos;ve shown that we can explain to a big part of the data -- people are actually doing their movements in the same way to <unk> the negative consequences of the noise .
this is from the <unk> of the west .
mars has the biggest <unk> of the solar system , which is <unk> .
this is my <unk> . it was only a couple of weeks ago .
the oldest rock on earth is just <unk> billion .
and the result of our career was a <unk> <unk> called <unk> .
we fold it , and we &apos;re using it in a <unk> .
this is about <unk> , oregon .
i think on the <unk> , let &apos;s look at this -- &quot; eight to 12 . &quot;
and there was a guy who sold these weapons for sex , because lego -- the <unk> -- no , they &apos;re not going to work .
and then there are some examples of <unk> things are real sculptures .
i &apos;ve got to tell you , for me had changed all the time .
maybe most importantly , the influence on other companies is enormous .
in fact , politics is <unk> .
in brazil , it &apos;s now <unk> <unk> , whereas the united states only had 700 , and <unk> two in california -- and within three years , the percentage of <unk> was about four percent of 85 percent .
this is not <unk> . <unk> are a really big thing .
scientists tell us -- and these are only bacteria -- that we have to have to get the <unk> of <unk> , and that &apos;s as fast as possible .
i can hardly expect to think about what we name is the crisis against the crisis .
it &apos;s still less people who are still available , and then you &apos;re going to get the <unk> of the curve , and you get this classic <unk> curve .
b is on the edge of the network .
and this is what happens to each of you .
the red dots will be the <unk> , and the yellow dots are going to be friends with flu .
would you get access to <unk> ?
and there is , i think there are three ways that can be used this <unk> data .
and the building was in the <unk> of the <unk> economy , and the death of the <unk> economy in the beginning of the &apos; 90s .
even though it seems to be a completely <unk> place , if you look at it from the top , it seems to be a whole net of <unk> and <unk> that every single house .
in this tradition , the future , the future <unk> all of their <unk> that they &apos;re going to do almost their new husband .
what a place like the <unk> david is particularly remarkable , is this kind of <unk> , where people have a basis that you can do to use .
we can only ask , &quot; how is the <unk> of the <unk> ? &quot; and what we &apos;re thinking about -- or what we want to ask .
it has <unk> the workers through technology .
you can see the left in the screen a few symbols that show what &apos;s going on with his right arm .
they &apos;re older , and they will always be older .
or even if we &apos;re going to be much older , our cars are going to be able to walk with people .
they were done in a moment .
it &apos;s always more more likely that we can &apos;t win .
the two <unk> behind the neocortex will help me to bring the result on the screen .
one of the journalists said , &quot; what happens ? &quot;
the <unk> are <unk> , the same as french <unk> .
i think there &apos;s a couple of reasons , but here &apos;s just a couple of reasons , but here &apos;s just some of the things that we &apos;re interested in .
he was <unk> by the <unk> , he was <unk> , he was like a <unk> for light , a little bit a <unk> .
let me go from door to door to the international community , and you see if somebody &apos;s <unk> or suffering for these <unk> .
but for sex , it was too late .
he looked at it .
<unk> power : a complicated hero
this is called jobs and possibilities of all the <unk> .
but today , i &apos;m going to talk about food , because in fact , this year , last year , and 2008 , during the <unk> , we &apos;ve got enough food .
and i &apos;m going to go into these movements when you &apos;re there , and you can see what you can get , and i think you can &apos;t get food , you can &apos;t get food .
we see changes in schools by girls .
i want to talk about something that i call digital food .
and what i found is that they &apos;re more than <unk> and other things , invest in a school program .
thank you .
we could do the same thing in cancer .
they &apos;re not going to go to a <unk> .
it &apos;s not abstract ; it &apos;s the interaction with the environment .
it &apos;s a <unk> device , not because it shows me , like many <unk> , i &apos;m <unk> every day , but because it &apos;s 24 hours long , which i do .
that was never shown .
the <unk> of these magnets is so big that we can see with this technology that we can see with this technology .
that you don &apos;t have to hurt the tumor .
if the soldier is big enough , and their resolution to get enough , then they can actually look at all the proteins in the body and begin to understand the individual system .
the most of us think of the <unk> , and interestingly , 12 <unk> per minute about the <unk> of a <unk> people .
now , if i take this -- -- long than a couple of seconds , you would feel curious ; more than a couple of minutes , and they would go to the room .
now this is all realized . and that &apos;s the glamour that &apos;s going to be in the world in the world .
and i was sitting there with two very good friends from me , richard <unk> and kevin <unk> .
while we met miles and miles from <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who could be <unk> .
so as i &apos;m here today , and i &apos;m talking to you , i was talking about the <unk> of about five years ago .
10 miles from the coast of the coast and in <unk> feet .
the oceans define climate and weather , they think the temperature are stable and shapes the chemistry of the world .
<unk> there are easy ...
that &apos;s the result , if you don &apos;t know that there are borders , which is what we &apos;re going to take the ocean .
in the last three years , the united states have been the united states for example of <unk> square miles .
we need <unk> , new technologies to explore the ocean of the ocean .
one of my early career , i wanted to figure out how the wing of insects are enough force to think about the air .
let &apos;s study this idea of simplicity .
this is a beautiful image of the lens <unk> of a mouse from jeff <unk> , and you can see the wonderful images of brains that he showed in his talk .
it <unk> a <unk> , to give a lot of behavior , a different <unk> has a different <unk> and pattern , and you can think that this is in a very complicated system .
our mission is to build a <unk> and <unk> response to the human brain .
he &apos;s home and <unk> tea .
if you look at the surface of the neocortex , you know that it &apos;s out of louder small components . <unk> <unk> , like in a computer .
how many of the <unk> tree are there ? where are it ?
we can look at tissue , and we can change neurons .
we can get all of these neurons , every single one in his own <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> , and watch what happens .
<unk> <unk> says that the secrets of the brain can &apos;t be solved . <unk> , memory , perception : they &apos;re out of neurons and electrical signals , and he &apos;s going to take them with a <unk> , which is the brain to find the brain with <unk> values .
it would be two or three thousand bombs .
the air force began to build smaller models , and started this .
and that &apos;s what nasa did to get a <unk> to get a <unk> that would fly to mars .
i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about <unk> behavior .
it &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there are so much insight that you can get from people .
the bottom line ? yellow .
if you ask people this question , you probably think that there &apos;s something to do with culture .
the countries on the right side , those who are very much more , a slightly different form .
i &apos;m going to give you another example of this .
but to get it back , it will be more complex .
it &apos;s a online <unk> for <unk> dollars .
the <unk> idea here , by the way , is that we really don &apos;t know our <unk> .
so , in medical <unk> , this is our view .
and the <unk> is limited .
<unk> -- you can only use to protect the eyes of the eyes of the eyes .
their intensity can be made very quickly , and they can be made very quick .
they &apos;re critical .
but that &apos;s just by the way .
cars are <unk> and <unk> and can communicate with each other , and you can communicate through the <unk> <unk> with the cars and so forth .
dna is what &apos;s going to be true .
it &apos;s actually not so many data .
you have the <unk> of his genome , and the power of this is an <unk> medicine that &apos;s better than today -- they don &apos;t have the side side side .
it &apos;s really easy -- has only <unk> genes -- but we couldn &apos;t get it completely .
we &apos;re not going to walk as little organisms alone on the world , but they &apos;re part of a big culture .
the consequences can be bad -- if we go to the earth -- but that &apos;s just the result of one of us , but that &apos;s just the result of one of us .
now , i &apos;m mostly here , because it &apos;s a kind of <unk> in the moment that we have on one side of people who think you &apos;re on one side of people who think you &apos;re going to be a dog , first by making the rules , human rules .
they &apos;re just like &quot; <unk> , &quot; just too , and so they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
no , we &apos;re doing , &quot; <unk> , sit . &quot; -- <unk> , he can try it for six to 10 .
these are like the golden <unk> .
and i would say if you don &apos;t need it to be not going to be not .
not only with the <unk> , but also with the rest of the family .
these <unk> are so simple .
their children are easy to train .
wk : i want to do a stick .
so , and this orchestra -- does it work ?
wk : yeah . i &apos;m always thinking about this to work with energy .
because even though i use scientific issues in songs , it &apos;s sometimes very hard to use them .
and even less , if it comes from <unk> and <unk> , like in my case .
one is a white light .
130 <unk> are <unk> by 75 .
let &apos;s look at the third question .
the desert <unk> has a mile or two per year .
the homo erectus was the same tool of about 30 generations .
you can teach them in the lab , a little bit of <unk> , and there are also a <unk> <unk> in other animals , but in fact , in fact , we never &apos;ve been able to deal with a object on another .
it &apos;s the wealth , in the <unk> of your own needs to save time .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done as a species .
but there is no evidence .
and as people began to do objects like this far <unk> , this was a clue that a <unk> between groups existed .
but who knows how to make a computer ?
but i think that &apos;s because of the connections that people are going to go , and that &apos;s the same thing that i &apos;ve never been able to do , and i &apos;m also sure that the technology is going to use technology , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s going to be able to be able to improve technology , and that &apos;s why it &apos;s going to be better .
this is so high as a <unk> building , and i &apos;ve got the <unk> <unk> .
now , we don &apos;t talk about it , but we don &apos;t take it seriously seriously .
they &apos;re just the same way , these feelings , they &apos;re gone .
if we think about the <unk> <unk> <unk> , it &apos;s usually the quick development of the problem because how can we discover things that change all the time ?
now , i &apos;ve talked -- you know this situation if you don &apos;t get <unk> in the hospital ?
what about real people ?
we <unk> a part of their viruses ; it &apos;s new , there are a new <unk> .
after 10 years ago , they came back to a collection , and it &apos;s still <unk> -- they have <unk> -- little oxygen in their lungs .
it wasn &apos;t going to be very often <unk> .
it &apos;s a classic <unk> , but it &apos;s completely new . nobody had seen it before .
and a huge battery could have that .
so , instead of doing something that is called the <unk> of the <unk> .
i took a <unk> <unk> on the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> with high density , and <unk> salt in between it .
but david is young and smart , and he wants to make a <unk> , and so he &apos;s going to build it -- he &apos;s going to build the first <unk> with this chemical composition .
so what do we learned from all of this ?
this video was taken in <unk> . six kilometers from the coast of <unk> <unk> <unk> , about 20 feet under the surface of the surface .
so , i realized that our garage was not big enough enough for this growing project .
and i began to think of mary <unk> , and how much they &apos;ve figured out it and how it &apos;s important , and how important they found that kids can discover things , and they don &apos;t have to teach them , in a open way .
evolution is often being seen as this one way that we &apos;ve met , but it &apos;s actually a big number of possibilities .
i &apos;m going to get this out to the phase of the space of space .
our cities are <unk> , there are many of you in the coast of the coast .
there are stars and so that .
so if we think about <unk> behavior or oil , how it &apos;s the <unk> of the <unk> , it &apos;s about language . we think about communication .
this expression , also as proud of <unk> , was <unk> <unk> , and she showed that people , and from birth to blind people , this is where they win with a <unk> .
so , i thought about it . you &apos;re looking at these people and see how it &apos;s going on . could you get them to do it , and you would be able to do it more ?
what happens to a <unk> , what happens if you &apos;re looking at the <unk> stage ? how the following little eradication , these tiny <unk> , these tiny <unk> ?
this is what happens in the lab . the little exercise , for just a few minutes . where can you really do that ? that was important .
so these things . the people show you think about it . you &apos;re showing yourself yourself .
she was totally <unk> , and he said , &quot; i don &apos;t have to look at this . &quot;
they need your body , privacy and two minutes . it can be able to change the other life in the big way .
<unk> swim <unk> , to get to their <unk> , and <unk> <unk> a ant , <unk> her brain , and they &apos;re going to take a <unk> , like a jeep .
and you need to have a kind of <unk> , you have to have a answer .
so , it &apos;s like i think richard and i think that these ideas are not going to be <unk> .
and of course , they &apos;re essentially extinct .
but under all of these ideas that we &apos;re going to use for our technology in the entire world , are many <unk> ideas .
and how about viruses we should not try to <unk> them .
and in my game , it &apos;s called <unk> .
we took some ideas on the legs , we went back to <unk> .
i know you &apos;re going to tell me , &quot; t doesn &apos;t exist in music . &quot;
audience : t , e , d.
nobody doesn &apos;t hear each other . none of the other .
they &apos;re going to see the orchestra in a kind of <unk> <unk> .
i don &apos;t want to be able to think that that doesn &apos;t have to be better , but that we need to be better if it &apos;s about to answer the questions that you need to look at when you think about the consequences and the reactions .
they &apos;re working in <unk> . they &apos;re driver .
five dollars can save a life .
it &apos;s <unk> about two dollars a day , and he &apos;s explained to me that they &apos;re not going to have kids to have kids , before these things are done .
after all , from despair , she went out , and she went to a long old woman .
it &apos;s not even new .
and as you say , if you &apos;re angry , you &apos;re going to think of the best speech you &apos;ve ever been thinking .
okay , the big majority of us .
and the message was actually also <unk> , the <unk> of everything , and the unit of everything . and that &apos;s a fundamental value of respect , <unk> to strangers .
who &apos;s thinking about it ?
they &apos;re going to start , in israel and palestine , in rwanda , in rwanda , in rwanda .
and so more , more and more <unk> , and since recently , they &apos;ve got a car to support their family .
look at somebody , with a different culture , from one other country , with a different <unk> , which is kind of different , and it &apos;s kind of different , and you hear him in a conversation ; you hear him .
i &apos;m starting to start where the story started , in <unk> .
today , before you <unk> , who had to be able to make the opportunity to create ?
you see here , 35 percent of these less famous houses in which 50,000 <unk> people live , 35 percent of houses had a <unk> shower .
95 percent of what we &apos;re doing is follow the consequences of <unk> , things that are actually done wrong around .
we &apos;ve done this . he was <unk> .
we found later that in this region , in this region , the cause of disease and death is .
one thing is in the context with everything we &apos;ve done , in the middle of the <unk> , nelson mandela said , &quot; how slavery and <unk> is not <unk> . it &apos;s the piece of people . it &apos;s the piece of people . it &apos;s the piece of people .
i don &apos;t care if you call me a <unk> . really not .
it really doesn &apos;t seem to say that this is based on here , but if you &apos;re trying to use that , it &apos;s amazing effective .
and this is what i &apos;m going to do with you in the belief that kids don &apos;t want kids to get their community to live in a better life .
this is the youngest of <unk> <unk> in america with our <unk> of the bronx of the bronx .
this is a picture of the mayor of the bronx that children in his house , not in jail , not in jail so that they felt .
we gave something back .
if you have big children with small <unk> , they &apos;re the big , thick man in the middle of the middle , which is cool , and they create these responsibility under <unk> , which is incredible .
now , you might wonder about these children .
you know , children from these <unk> .
stephen <unk> : a teacher who <unk> the south bronx <unk>
secondly , i bet that even if you look at the difference here , there &apos;s a brain that &apos;s going to look at the difference here , and this <unk> line is right for this <unk> line .
for 10 : <unk> , the farm was a heart attack .
people with <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> , a band with <unk> neurons -- here in red -- this is where three to five millimeters per minute per minute is moving .
now , the problem is that 30 million americans have <unk> , and we need a <unk> . i think we &apos;re now .
my first wish is that the <unk> <unk> <unk> for <unk> , the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> economist -- for the treatment of others .
and we &apos;re going to put together on <unk> <unk> in the hope of <unk> <unk> , who <unk> the <unk> of the poor patients full of pity .
after a half years ago , four of five of the <unk> , four of five of the <unk> , and by the way , <unk> &quot; <unk> , &quot; also <unk> .
how do you know what &apos;s really important ?
so i thought , &quot; i &apos;m going to talk about death . &quot;
i &apos;ve got the first time to put it here .
these people below the <unk> , i call <unk> , because they &apos;re going to be <unk> from the process , you know , to share with the world .
they &apos;ve been able to use <unk> as a platform to develop their <unk> , to develop their <unk> and <unk> , who teach the people to teach them .
yes , books that might be sold 100 or 1,000 dollars a year .
it &apos;s not surprised that it &apos;s all like , right ?
how do we protect it for the future ?
so this is not very hard .
the days of <unk> are coming up , if people say , &quot; well we would have to have four or <unk> of it in our country to see how this works . &quot;
no , it &apos;s not <unk> . it &apos;s a <unk> .
you can use a few thousand children with two <unk> .
so it &apos;s kind of like an electronic book .
everybody says this is a 100 dollars , you can &apos;t create .
and this is the <unk> .
they click on things around and <unk> . &quot;
he says , &quot; no , no , no . there &apos;s a better opportunity . &quot;
we &apos;re all going to play &quot; i love god , &quot; on a big line , <unk> from information , and we can &apos;t walk .
thank you .
i think most people think that a <unk> mother , always their child &apos;s <unk> .
that &apos;s not possible . that &apos;s not .
it &apos;s going to be good . they &apos;re going to live .
first of all , the <unk> <unk> .
two years ago , one of the girls came to me and told me a story .
how do you make a better health care ?
the <unk> is how easy the system is .
if you look at the area of <unk> space in the age of four to 22 years , they take them in childhood childhood , which shows this graph . it <unk> in the early youth .
and the idea that her father was going to be <unk> in the public , until that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
this is the <unk> that we built together .
after the first year , it was invited by the <unk> <unk> museum in austria , and i &apos;m happy to tell you that there was there online , 24 hours a day , for almost nine years a day , for almost nine years .
but in the night , as we <unk> , i asked the <unk> , as the <unk> decided that they would have said that they would be <unk> <unk> .
and here &apos;s the result .
a place where my family was working on four generations in the <unk> .
and honestly , i don &apos;t have a clue what it is with <unk> , but they &apos;re incredibly <unk> .
the first thing that you see in <unk> is the awful force of <unk> .
he comes back to my leg , <unk> me back to a car , and i &apos;m going to bring me to a child , and i can bring me to a doctor .
it was a <unk> in the floor .
and she said , &quot; well , it &apos;s about it . &quot;
we &apos;ve created that 200 years of the end of our <unk> <unk> with the world .
it &apos;s so easy to see technology as a metaphor for the memory , but our brains are not the perfect <unk> like technology .
it &apos;s the <unk> of my <unk> .
i &apos;d like to think -- thank you .
and i can assure you : nigeria is in everything else .
you should know that in every community , the number of <unk> is already <unk> .
i took three <unk> in antarctica .
but tell me where they are , and what land they are . &quot;
we also discovered the surface of the islands -- a very important <unk> for birds , one of the most important <unk> in the pacific .
and we &apos;re in the rest of the world , a problem .
he coined the term &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
of course , the <unk> , and the open lake , the open seas , but the <unk> that everybody would like to look at was in trouble .
here &apos;s the pacific , with huge <unk> and huge <unk> .
now , there is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> for a lot of our devices , even on the <unk> .
it &apos;s a <unk> debate , and there is no sense , no only answer to it , but if you &apos;re a <unk> , like me , you say , &quot; well , what do you tell us about the data ? &quot;
instead , he took very carefully , which happens to come back , if technology was the first time in a environment and in a community .
so there is , of course , two different possibilities .
this is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually a <unk> painting .
i mean , it was at least how it made me happy .
well , there was a question that was , of course , a question that i &apos;d like to do in the head of my head : well , can i do more from the things that i like to do in design , and less of whom i don &apos;t like to do that ?
and this is what it is .
they &apos;re going to be a horrible situation without <unk> .
they &apos;re going to <unk> in hospitals .
as <unk> , for example , i was going to see as extremely <unk> in <unk> , because i &apos;ve heard the <unk> , and i know how i have to use <unk> , and i know how i have to use <unk> , and i can work fast with the <unk> .
i &apos;ve seen these value of older people in so many of my friends , in the &apos; &apos; 60s , &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , and 90s , and the 90s are still active than <unk> , both , girls and doctors .
and as a <unk> <unk> was made , and from <unk> <unk> <unk> , young president of men in the united states and canada and <unk> and <unk> , they &apos;re going to go back to the bible of the bible .
the case of <unk> , the last muslim <unk> of europe .
the biggest evil , <unk> , don &apos;t want those rocks , and so he &apos;s trying to get them into the <unk> .
and one of my favorites is <unk> from yemen .
&quot; and , when is the article out there ? &quot;
<unk> : it has to give something that we can do .
&#91; &quot; the 99 , &quot; thank you .
it &apos;s dangerous if a group of a group of self is extremely <unk> .
<unk> <unk> : islam <unk> .
let &apos;s look at it .
let me share it for you .
let me show you this one .
and when i started with the design , i discovered something surprising about myself .
so they have the eye , and then the concepts come out .
but of course china has a massive population .
but what that shows is that this kind of action is a form of information is a form of <unk> .
it &apos;s even a dialogue with them , because they &apos;re visual .
the <unk> is called the <unk> project in britain .
so why don &apos;t it doesn &apos;t matter like <unk> or <unk> ? so there are two theories .
and a theory allows you to work with less .
now after a few months of <unk> , i discovered that there is a kind of molecule that &apos;s called <unk> , and that &apos;s exactly the same thing .
this is the foundation for the machine that these two people built from ford .
they created it -- and it &apos;s just like abstraction .
that was a good thing .
for time , a series of things that i want you to do is want to do it attention .
and they didn &apos;t have a sense of the context of the context that they came out .
norman !
i didn &apos;t say anybody on it , not my mom , i didn &apos;t mean my sister , my brother , my brother , my <unk> , my cousins , my <unk> , my grandparents , no one .
i talk about it . i &apos;m just thinking about that i had two things when i left the orphanage that i wanted to do . that was one of my family , and the other was to write poems .
and this is how we &apos;re looking for them .
and then you know that one of us there are <unk> and small parts .
he had to be a <unk> , and it has to be <unk> from other , female and probably a lot of smaller family <unk> to achieve his age of 12 years .
is that a good evolutionary adaptation , or is it going to be that we &apos;re going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to happen on the planet earth ?
but are we going to do that , or are we going to take the nature of your time ?
one day , a couple of weeks ago , or maybe a year later , i was at my <unk> in a store for <unk> , and i wanted to buy <unk> -- we had a <unk> .
that meant a fundamental change for me .
my favorite thing : about 70 layers of this , <unk> of this , <unk> <unk> .
do you know how to be obsessed with me ? this project is just for me , and yet i went so far to be able to buy a chinese newspaper from <unk> from san francisco to buy the bird .
so , when we <unk> the way to the <unk> of blue mountains in the west of edinburgh , it was a perfect <unk> : <unk> , the smell of <unk> and a dream .
&quot; no , it &apos;s too hard . &quot;
and if you &apos;re ever going to go back , only with a <unk> . &quot;
i remember that my father came out in a wheelchair , and i was from the top to the bottom , and i was from the top to the bottom , and i felt at the first time the sun on my face .
they said , &quot; we &apos;re going to put you back next to them , because we think that this is good for them . &quot;
she was forced me to the <unk> , and i called the school school , and i said that i &apos;d like to be a <unk> book .
and i said , &quot; <unk> . &quot;
and mama and dad and dad were never left .
i am in this world , but i work in the world .
it &apos;s like a <unk> <unk> that &apos;s going to fly through a richard <unk> .
how do i make a telephone in three weeks , if i &apos;ve done these things that have evolved over millions of years ?
every one of these elements , you could stand on the wall as a kind of <unk> .
in his days , he was the highest <unk> in british .
i &apos;m looking at the same <unk> , and how they move out -- how they grow and move . it &apos;s based on furniture , but it &apos;s not the <unk> , but it &apos;s not the <unk> .
this is the car of the future . it &apos;s a <unk> .
if you look at it next to 350 architecture , it feels like i &apos;m really <unk> .
this is my studio . it &apos;s south africa .
it was done from <unk> .
at the time , i had done my husband , and i had happiness to be a <unk> member who used him to explore the ocean for the first time to explore the ocean .
there was one of the <unk> .
it uses red bioluminescence like a <unk> <unk> to the animals that are <unk> for the red light , and you can see it &apos;s not going to be seen without seen .
so they use it to eat and get partners .
i urge you to be able to call a different science that &apos;s still used hundreds of years ago .
this is a simple place .
so , i was able to deal with the value of the <unk> .
and at june june , i heard a <unk> tradition on the <unk> that my life changed , and that &apos;s what i did .
and here &apos;s the <unk> .
after the price , my life changed .
another example of the distribution of <unk> on the lives of birds .
so , if i &apos;m like something like this -- this is the sound for purple .
so after the way i put it down , i can hear music with the food and <unk> .
one of them is , &quot; i have a <unk> &quot; by martin luther king , and the other one is from hitler .
now , in fact , you can still see that the <unk> <unk> are now the <unk> .
you don &apos;t want to say <unk> , who could be used to be used to be used . &quot;
absolutely critical .
and what happens when teachers want to be ready ?
and why don &apos;t you ? you don &apos;t tell the law . why don &apos;t you tell the law ?
it &apos;s so that freedom is that freedom has a <unk> structure .
because the life is complex . and here &apos;s the hardest and the biggest change : we need to get the authority for the magic and the application of the law and <unk> .
a free society needs red and green lights , otherwise it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> for the interest that the <unk> can calculate , and for the <unk> that they can take .
well , if you think about it , it &apos;s really hard to come back with a <unk> <unk> .
he had a very bad job .
he only had a <unk> .
but the problem for rules and incentives , is that they &apos;re going to be <unk> <unk> , and they <unk> the <unk> activity in two ways .
so , <unk> <unk> are better than nothing , but it &apos;s hard to see that a lot of intelligent <unk> is able to get it to <unk> time .
why did this idea make this idea ?
people want to be <unk> .
it was a extraordinary time . i &apos;m going to be able to do a little bit more <unk> that we -- america and the rest of the world -- at the time .
this was <unk> , the <unk> .
we &apos;ve got to do this with a full <unk> .
what i want to show you is , what you need to use about 45 pounds of <unk> <unk> .
what would have been if you had a nuclear weapons ?
we come down and put the rock that they just looked at , somewhere in the <unk> .
so , the problem is that the <unk> itself , <unk> , from the thought of a nuclear disaster .
and it was sent to me from somebody who &apos;s a <unk> of the <unk> . the fact is that it &apos;s hard to have america .
there are many black sheep out there that have done the wrong things and the problems that have done the problems .
we can show our results . we can make things better .
how can we use them ?
it &apos;s <unk> to have a dangerous challenge .
imagine we could do it , because if we could do it , we could achieve more .
the governments who do most progress is the governments that have found the ways that people have found , &quot; healthier value &quot; in the behavior , instead of going to see the government to see the <unk> .
maybe i can see the brain , and i can change my <unk> .
i want to put it back .
come to me a moment with me in the 19th century , and i was in the 20th century .
we could certainly be so productive if facebook or twitter or twitter would not be as much time .
they &apos;re going to be <unk> on the british government to get money for the <unk> machines , because they thought that these machines are enormous practical impact for society .
these particles didn &apos;t only have less wealthy men &apos;s research , but they &apos;re also <unk> to look at how to look at the <unk> , rather than just <unk> questions .
i &apos;m going to tell you how i learned about life .
if you start to look at the very small stuff -- this person had written a whole article , and he said , &quot; hey , these are bacteria . &quot;
and all of the things that aren &apos;t old enough , they don &apos;t know how this <unk> happened -- that &apos;s because of this <unk> .
there are about 10,000 programs .
this would be the <unk> in which you can see each of the 26 letters of the <unk> in one of the most 26 monkeys that can find text grades .
wherever life is , you &apos;re going to have this distribution , in contrast to this distribution .
to hot , too hot .
the pilot says , &quot; are you sure ? hey <unk> , you &apos;re sure you &apos;ve lost this ? &quot;
this is the data from a single conference to the <unk> in a single magazine in zambia , about a couple of years ago , a couple of years ago i have <unk> .
and as you can see , solly was much more hair at the same time .
you could talk about 10,000 , 20,000 or 30,000 dollars , if i had the time , or it &apos;s in my plan , and i didn &apos;t just be in the keyboard .
instead of trying to teach people how to take the neuron on the mobile phone , we should develop a software that allows them to do it , without practice , without my <unk> .
that &apos;s less than i was going back to the time , when i came up for two weeks .
and then we understand that if we want to change our mirror , in life or in the balloon , we need to change the height .
this is going to be in the tsunami .
and that &apos;s why they need <unk> .
i promised myself that i &apos;m going to get the next time i would be able to get a fuel , not to take a fuel , regardless of fossil <unk> , to be sure , not to be honest by the <unk> .
i think you need a pilot in the airplane that i can talk to the universities who can talk to students while we can talk to people during the <unk> , and it really can be able to do a human adventure .
and what &apos;s the goal ?
this is why all of the people who believe in these laws , welcome to be part of this team .
now , you just need a laptop .
anyway , in fact , africa was a simple place .
the next thing i want to create clarity is what this problem is , and what it doesn &apos;t is .
this is crazy , really , if you think about it .
so let &apos;s end up with a second .
in fact , we &apos;re the first generation of the disease and this extreme poverty in the eyes , you can see it on the ocean , say it &apos;s about the ocean , you don &apos;t have to be .
it &apos;s on the nerves .
this year is a test for us , especially for the leaders of the <unk> states that have been done , and the world is looking at the world .
people find it slowly .
and with this one campaign as our washing screen , my organization , and other groups , and other groups of the energy and the enthusiasm that was out of hollywood to the <unk> of america .
step back to step back , a nurse , a teacher , a teacher , a teacher , and life will be saved .
the idea that the internet has changed all their lives , a country that can change all their lives -- and a continent that has just been able to be able to be able to do this , let me get the head .
green are not hot green , but <unk> .
now , the challenge is to see what this shapes is , and the <unk> .
now , if you &apos;re not just <unk> , it &apos;s the sentence , literally , wrong .
if we think about a problem or something new , we compare what we already know about , with what we already know about .
<unk> <unk> : i &apos;m happy to be here .
they &apos;re not going to go to all of these <unk> .
pm : i don &apos;t believe .
how are they going to do this , you know , but also with their <unk> ?
some of my wife was arrested .
this shows just a different image of yemen .
my heart was six times to big .
this is a list of side side : if you eat a lot of salt food , like a <unk> and <unk> sandwich , they &apos;re probably going to land on the <unk> .
but soon , i showed up symptoms for <unk> , and i had to go back to <unk> , you know that i would probably never see my home .
i was sitting there , and i was going to be happy with the <unk> , and i asked him what i thought if i had a shower , you could be able to talk to me .
i was going to be a dozen machines to live in my life .
thank you .
interestingly , one of these <unk> is also <unk> in the united states in the united states .
it &apos;s interesting to be interesting that the same company that &apos;s sold to the 80 million pounds of atrazine , the <unk> , and we also sold the antidote -- a <unk> and the same company .
we also went out as <unk> .
what would our <unk> kids like to say , if you had a long child , i had a little <unk> , some artificial <unk> , and i have a little <unk> <unk> , and a little <unk> .
the problem is that you &apos;re in my village , <unk> , in most of our villages , in most of our villages .
this is where you see the <unk> <unk> next to the airport of los angeles to the airport of los angeles .
i &apos;d spend 5 cents for each other .
the <unk> can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s become global .
here you see , in red , the <unk> of the <unk> .
they &apos;re like a mouse that &apos;s going to look at the foot of a elephant , and the biggest part of the part of them is <unk> .
they look out of their <unk> , and <unk> comes from all directions around us .
<unk> have a huge surface , which is in the sky , because they tend to do something that is called <unk> . <unk> .
<unk> <unk> is the <unk> stability , just like in a cathedral , and we help the tree to live longer .
it &apos;s totally <unk> to see that .
but since recently , all the doors of the <unk> <unk> and the walls are going on .
that was 25 years ago .
so let &apos;s look at the example of the <unk> .
how do these people do with these diseases ?
and you can afford to see how we work -- how to work -- like <unk> -- and try to find a way to find the <unk> that we meet .
you &apos;re going to see that you can see on the bottom of a <unk> : <unk> / <unk> , and if you open this graph on your computer , you &apos;re going to see this program , and then it &apos;s <unk> .
and if you look at the images of the scene of the scene , you can see that the <unk> of the <unk> is .
we need to find a way to find sure that all of the <unk> , even if the computer is .
but i don &apos;t have to create nothing .
this person is going to go through <unk> .
why should we believe what he says ? &quot;
what does his future look like ?
these forces disappear completely , no one <unk> the age of the time .
it would be good if people were <unk> , and this kind of secrets is serious , and this is how to change things , but it would change things on two <unk> species .
and that means that we can see a copy itself , if you only use a part of the <unk> system , this is in <unk> , and there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> and <unk> .
and the happy few , jill and kevin and kevin ? well , she came back from her <unk> , and they looked at her video as an <unk> .
thank you .
you &apos;re going to go to the way .
this is what he taught him to do , since he was five years old .
i &apos;m grateful for the fact that i had a friend like this , which was <unk> to me how to <unk> .
what is it that you know in life today ? not 10 years ago .
what do you do with what you do with what you do and make it happen ?
didn &apos;t have that -- time . i didn &apos;t know -- technology . you know , i didn &apos;t have the right managers .
in this moment , you know , you know , you know , in the moment , in the moment you &apos;re going to focus on something , you can see a meaning of a meaning , and what it means , it doesn &apos;t mean food .
you &apos;ve ever done what &apos;s done , and i went to say , &quot; this was me ! &quot;
to death feet . so , god in his <unk> wisdom , one other human need : the uncertainty .
but that &apos;s true : we need it . we can do it through intimacy , by the end , by the <unk> , by <unk> in nature .
and there are seven different people . i can &apos;t walk them , because i &apos;m talking about it . the last element is feeling .
dr. man with the family in <unk> , somebody in new york , who died when he was in the work of work , and this man who wanted to be a <unk> , and this man said to me .
instead , i &apos;m interested in creating tools with which a big number of people can tell their stories , people all over the world .
the color of particles is the kind of feeling of happiness -- happy , positive feelings have <unk> colors .
we see , &quot; i feel like i was in the computer . &quot;
and if i go over here , the list starts to walk , and there are thousands of feelings that have been taken .
the ten themes from the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
it &apos;s called &quot; universe : <unk> our modern mythology . &quot;
we can see it , and you can see this <unk> image of odysseus ford , like they were <unk> .
you can also look at <unk> , if you like to read torture to climate change .
so people feel like clouds as something that is in ways .
in life , they have tens of thousands of members in almost 100 countries on the entire earth .
they only need to go out a step out , and to notice that that &apos;s so likely to be so much , so <unk> is that all other other things are missing .
so you look down , they <unk> the <unk> beauty , and you &apos;re always thinking about to wear the head in the clouds .
that would have <unk> pictures that would have done this : &quot; <unk> , good , good , good .
and you know , 10 years ago , it was about 10 years ago , when i got the <unk> to buy my first <unk> . it was a huge machine .
these photographs come from a virtual <unk> .
here you can see how the knife was in the heart .
it &apos;s a small , giant pen , who &apos;s in his inner , very quickly <unk> .
this is a really interesting project .
so he &apos;s doing it .
so , very <unk> people .
i was as often as possible as possible as possible as possible to bring the academic stuff with the real world in connection .
it &apos;s still not anything , but it &apos;s an incredibly <unk> <unk> of everything we know about the <unk> of nature .
i &apos;m not going to go to the details why we think about the universe , but it makes sense of mathematics and trying to explain physics that we know .
but in my career , i &apos;m going to <unk> something in my career .
in 2001 , i visited her as a <unk> .
we got a lot of <unk> .
this shows that , at the first time , was at 2004 , at 2004 .
he &apos;s just talking about the <unk> of the <unk> , and i was struck with somebody that they all know .
every one is going to have a <unk> <unk> , but in different scientific disciplines .
i &apos;ve got my first computer as a teenager in austria , and it was a really great device .
he talked about the brain through ideo , and he said this is the most important brain that he ever saw .
at the next couple of slides , i &apos;m going to explain to you about that .
emotions are smaller to allow that , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done with technology .
our <unk> is coming behind this lens here .
i had such a <unk> that we &apos;ve done it wrong .
so in this sense , it &apos;s a very simple object .
so now we know what a album is .
i &apos;m going to call them the <unk> of the <unk> , because they &apos;re kind of <unk> .
we can see more details in our galaxy than something else else else .
and this brings us a factor of history .
so there was a bunch of alternatives to the idea that there was a <unk> black hole in the center of the galaxy , because you could have a lot of stuff there .
it <unk> on a site much more than on the other , and the cloud is going to go apart apart .
and i hope that i believe in the first thing that we have to have a really big black hole in the center of the galaxy , in the center of the galaxy .
one day i was in the streets of new york , and i saw a few children between mine , cars and <unk> baseball .
so , for example , the people in the school century are different , which is so <unk> .
in the first eight centuries of this tradition , the big &quot; which was the big , &quot; what , god , is to tell god .
with new and <unk> tools , the age of <unk> .
but a question is : what happens when the music stops ?
michael <unk> thomas : music and feelings in the time
so we &apos;re looking at the beginning of a new <unk> .
after the year , they brought it up to 100,000 dollars a year .
so i &apos;m going to talk about <unk> , although i don &apos;t know where i &apos;m going to start .
wow , a volunteers , great !
but recently , my interest was <unk> through a new view of a new view , because there are things that make this really cool thing .
well , i think this is the <unk> development of a phenomenon that we call <unk> innovation .
but the element of incentives is really the most important thing .
we &apos;re going to get incredible talks about them .
let me think about this point of sam <unk> .
but even if you <unk> the screen , it &apos;s going to be a lot more than just words .
thousands of individuals and organizations share their knowledge and their data online .
it &apos;s not crazy ; it &apos;s happening right now .
as <unk> global innovations .
first of all , i have to give a service of the audience , and i &apos;m talking about what i &apos;m going to give him to say instead of what i can &apos;t offer .
and they &apos;re fun to make their own , the ultimate <unk> or the worst tedtalk .
well , you can &apos;t compare them to each other .
they think of it , and you give them the sugar , such a kind of <unk> , which we call <unk> .
this kind of tests make this kind of tests , ok ?
somebody said , &quot; why ? &quot;
and he thought he could <unk> the waves . he couldn &apos;t .
i think there are three big changes , and that &apos;s in the areas of transparency , <unk> and <unk> , where people have a real power .
how do we do that ?
my <unk> , <unk> <unk> , said , on the entire world , there are more photos from their head than any other .
11 of 14 countries .
and secondly , the teachers were going to have the <unk> and <unk> as a <unk> <unk> , because they took specific areas to be able to be able to be able to make a <unk> sense of it .
so , i wish to be a beautiful weekend .
to read and write and write , will always be easier and cheaper .
<unk> are working on .
now you might ask , &quot; what would i do with a <unk> ? &quot;
if you &apos;ve got the <unk> of the world , this is going to be a <unk> that allows people to make answers .
the kingdom , his laws allow him to be <unk> , <unk> or <unk> , which is a economic risk or a <unk> or a risk for health care or the <unk> of the state of the state .
these laws are in the face for the science , and it &apos;s based on <unk> and ignorance and <unk> and one of the traditions of traditions and <unk> <unk> .
why will you be pregnant if you &apos;re positive ? &quot;
one of 10 <unk> <unk> of people who are using drugs .
that &apos;s how social <unk> , the condoms of <unk> <unk> , not even from the police , <unk> or <unk> .
here were kids born , people died there .
well , for personal work , we &apos;ve been <unk> now .
they got the surface , the street <unk> , the river below the street , and you come from a end of the end of a end , and you come from one end to another , without going to cross the <unk> .
people say , &quot; we don &apos;t want to live in tiny apartments . &quot;
also , jobs should have shared jobs .
your liver is <unk> oil .
and they killed around 12,000 sharks to this time , because it &apos;s just a <unk> from the <unk> <unk> in <unk> bay in <unk> island .
we know very little about them .
so this <unk> is the place of a food , depending on the time , and the <unk> , the temperature and depth .
let &apos;s look at the <unk> , which has to do with the genes that are going to come from the parents that are going to be taken from the parents , then we see that sharks , compared to the first study of 10 less diversity than others .
so this research was called this research , and found that the size of it is the size of it .
and what was okay . we were <unk> . no problem .
and i thought , &quot; hey , i can build . &quot;
so if we can see the gender of the food , before we take a sample , we can tell you whether it was from a male or females .
so i decided to give myself the <unk> .
their bodies are going to be <unk> , and they &apos;re <unk> to be used for any <unk> to make money -- people tell a lot of these stories .
no business with not done with anybody .
my journalism likes on other continents , or in other countries , is not <unk> , in my part of africa , but he &apos;s working on corruption , ask people to wonder , &quot; where are the evidence ?
tm : thank you .
i was <unk> in the early 80s in the early 1980s , two blocks away from the <unk> of the <unk> .
i wouldn &apos;t be like <unk> <unk> .
and had these people ever met a victim of their <unk> ?
today , you can see in 29 states , in more than half of the country , because of his <unk> <unk> .
and i realized that my mission , my mission to photograph was , because there was a million of different <unk> from gay .
in the same thing , i hope that it will be harder to get their human rights .
first : the world is , and it &apos;s always going to be good and evil , because good and evil , <unk> and <unk> are the <unk> .
and third of all , i had access to all 1,000 images who had done the soldiers .
in three ways : the <unk> kind of called <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> , a famous boy from the bronx , and he said , &quot; could the tv is happening here , and he said , &quot; could the tv happen here , here and now ? &quot;
&quot; my husband , who &apos;s responsible if he &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
sally <unk> , and i was both <unk> , and i was looking at high school , the james <unk> in the bronx of the bronx .
here are the pain with the symbols of power and sweden .
<unk> of the other . <unk> of itself .
alexander <unk> says that the border between good and evil through the heart of one of each people &apos;s heart .
and i took the experiment on the next day .
and he said , &quot; i did what everybody could do , &quot; no big thing to draw the <unk> .
it &apos;s a puzzle that &apos;s really hard to do .
we have a self .
but on my left level , an <unk> , which is a <unk> , which is based on the red arrow .
there &apos;s only a <unk> , which is the body .
i promise that i don &apos;t say anything about it , except that it &apos;s <unk> .
and the <unk> self has <unk> <unk> , thinking , imagination , creativity and language .
thank you . thank you for the <unk> -- and <unk> hill .
now i &apos;m telling you this -- i tell it and <unk> to make me ridiculous , because i think feminism is partly the challenge , <unk> , the aesthetics , and beauty is important .
we don &apos;t want to be a <unk> .
you can see , i &apos;m not going to <unk> me in condoms .
she talked about <unk> , they started <unk> , she was <unk> , she <unk> friends -- all these daily actions of understanding and creativity .
i mean that it &apos;s this <unk> , which is that the homo sapiens , the homo sapiens .
in fact , this is a sensor for teenagers who read the electrical activity in my brain , while i think this talk .
we <unk> many prototypes and products of life that you can control care of thinking , like <unk> <unk> , or a <unk> chair .
it &apos;s <unk> <unk> with a <unk> or a smartphone .
how these kids can use their new consciousness to be able to use many of the <unk> and <unk> social <unk> , which people who are going to be used as different as different , to see .
they understood the power of human history , and that &apos;s the value of the value that we &apos;re doing on people , change , <unk> and grows .
and i said , &quot; how are you going to celebrate ? &quot;
my skills and my possibilities and my possibilities .
<unk> , and very unexpected , they gave them .
this <unk> didn &apos;t have been able to explore my eyes .
i went to a way that i was good .
and it &apos;s very , very slowly , it happened .
i didn &apos;t really really believe i didn &apos;t really think of all the <unk> of me , all the <unk> of me , all the little <unk> in all of us .
that &apos;s me . my whole thing .
what we have , the same thing is the same thing that &apos;s the same process , but in one of them , you feel great , and on the other hand , with only a small change in <unk> , you feel awful .
but i think it &apos;s a different debate that &apos;s going to be going to be able to be able to deal with the kind of control of control that we have about our car .
we would have had a <unk> percent of this money , you can put <unk> in the water , which doesn &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to survive .
i &apos;m not going to go to the full <unk> of one of the other .
sometimes the <unk> are very , very long .
i think the danger in the world today is that the field of the field of the system is that the field of the field is going to be understood by human psychology .
would be the average answer in 50 to 60 percent .
it &apos;s going to be <unk> that they don &apos;t eat itself , even other other .
god !
it &apos;s 20 , 30 years back .
but that doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;ve got a coin with your head on both sides .
it &apos;s not hard to solve this problem .
but this is our skin of the direct universe .
thank you .
we had <unk> , in fact , in fact , really strong effects in children around the world , and now , in humans , every time .
it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful that wants to live alive .
hello . my name is dan <unk> . i am 34 years old , and i have <unk> .
so this is actually the composition of <unk> piece that he &apos;s completely made in madagascar .
ben said , &quot; okay , we &apos;re doing a <unk> .
now , there &apos;s the present self , first of all the time .
i have to write five pages on the day for paper , or i had to give five dollars .
it &apos;s not possible that this is going to work today . &quot;
and i &apos;m going to show you some of these tools here .
the last thing i &apos;m going to show you is the last <unk> project , is something that i &apos;ve made with hal <unk> together , which i &apos;ve created by my <unk> project , bill <unk> .
it &apos;s pretty good that it doesn &apos;t seem about people , because when one of the faces smiles , the other face , the other face , the other face <unk> .
and this is one of the reasons that we have to be as much of what we &apos;re interested in western science , mathematics and <unk> , in the first couple of centuries of our <unk> <unk> of the <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
<unk> is the unknown , because it doesn &apos;t have the <unk> .
so it doesn &apos;t seem that if you &apos;re talking about mental diseases , you probably think stories of <unk> suffering , shame and <unk> in almost all of life .
a little bit more than 30 years ago , the nations of the world of the world in <unk> , and we gave this <unk> explanation .
what is it ?
if you look at the level of species , you &apos;ve heard about the fish .
so , if you look at these value , you can see that almost 8,000 of these dollars are in reality .
this was in the early <unk> , when india wanted to be <unk> -- as we wanted to be <unk> -- for china with his <unk> growth of eight , nine , 10 percent , and she said , why can &apos;t we do that ?
it doesn &apos;t make them happy , but they have the trust and the courage to say , &quot; and the courage to say , &quot; that &apos;s what we call .
green carbon , so the emissions of deforestation and agriculture , and <unk> carbon , are 25 percent of our emissions .
richard feynman was a very complex man .
we loved it .
i didn &apos;t know what these things are . it doesn &apos;t be -- 11 , by the way , not .
i also liked this intellectual <unk> .
and he said he was essentially the same relationship to his father .
there was a theory .
he did it again .
they don &apos;t move , and because they don &apos;t have to move in the bottom of the experiment , you don &apos;t have to worry about how they move .
we only get the whole <unk> , and the <unk> color , which is just the very amazing <unk> .
many of these ideas <unk> in the <unk> bank .
if you think about their children to send their children in the <unk> school , they &apos;re going to come with <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
but let me take them under their own conditions , and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that they &apos;re not going to learn from <unk> <unk> .
if you want to make a device , you don &apos;t do it .
i think that &apos;s all the time . this is number <unk> . okay .
so here you see the sick knee on the left , and this is my wife in the <unk> today , four months after , in desire , and in good constitution .
how about a completely <unk> <unk> , not only share the parts ?
and this is one of the seven of the seven things that &apos;s not taken into all of the <unk> .
and so it came out in the years of <unk> <unk> , for first thousands , then hundreds of thousands of , and finally millions of individual , and finally , millions of individual , small mirrors to print that one of the hell of hell in the sky .
but how does our imagination work ?
but we never think about the hidden connections .
when we invented the light bulb , she looked like this .
you need to be very smart , and even though i don &apos;t have an <unk> , it doesn &apos;t mean that i &apos;m stupid because you can &apos;t be stupid , and you can &apos;t get it into the world .
they literally have the door <unk> .
if you listen to the <unk> of your <unk> , both ears , both ears are both students .
we &apos;ve got the problem that <unk> <unk> .
thank you very much .
that &apos;s why i &apos;m particularly interested in systems and <unk> .
recently , i &apos;ve created a couple of <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> .
and i put their own special map for every single person , and he wrote her names on it , <unk> them , and they put them .
i &apos;m sure i can see how to <unk> .
and i &apos;m convinced that it &apos;s <unk> , my valuable and more different life on this earth &apos;s right now .
in this mode , he tried to think his position .
i thought i &apos;d tell a little bit about how nature makes materials .
that &apos;s how we think about future technologies . we start at the beginning of the world .
and if you look at it , you can see the offspring with the <unk> , where they have different charges .
and through a series of <unk> , you can get one of a billion fish , which is what you want to do , like a battery , a battery or a solar cell .
in this case , you &apos;re going to see <unk> .
if you ask people the question : where do you get to do something important ?
i sat on my desk in my desk , i used to use my expensive computers .
what happens -- sometimes you &apos;ve got these days where you read about eight o &apos;clock in the morning , or about seven or when they come up , and you say , man , i &apos;m really not going to meet good .
in the office , most of <unk> and <unk> that people are actually <unk> by the work , <unk> .
we all know that this is true . you would never see a <unk> meeting that is going to be <unk> by employees .
so ladies and managers are now the two problems in companies , especially in offices .
now , you &apos;ve got two weeks ago , or every week , once the week , <unk> that nobody can talk about .
you know , to be honest , i &apos;m going to do this for seven years and have no idea how the future is going to look like .
but if you ask people to get out of these three important things that you &apos;re going to wear -- don &apos;t mean what culture and what relationship -- say , most people : key , money , and if you have one one , the mobile phone , and if you have one , the mobile phone .
but , and this is a very big thing , but we &apos;ve got the tendency to forget .
well , i want to give you a practical example of the <unk> .
they take 10 or 20 percent <unk> , and then , the owner of the book takes 10 or 20 percent <unk> , and there &apos;s the rest of the same amount of <unk> in my family .
it shows the norm .
and he &apos;s kind of got a <unk> for the values of night .
and at the same time , we &apos;re looking at these mobile devices , we see a expectation of availability .
our present reality is less interesting than the story we &apos;re going to tell later about that .
what did we talk about ?
dean <unk> <unk> with us new research , which shows how the <unk> healthy influence a human level , and he tells you that if we &apos;re healthy life , better food , <unk> , and more love , our brain is actually <unk> our brain .
until i tell you who he said it .
so in this point , we can &apos;t feel regret about many different things .
when i went home to the night after i got my tattoo , i was almost the whole night .
but i want to suggest that there &apos;s still a farm .
i mean , even the bad answer to all , &quot; the answer to all of the <unk> can go back to <unk> .
and as i said earlier , i am a <unk> .
i thought i was going to try to go to my ted wish , which is what i &apos;m trying to do , and how this is to see what you &apos;re trying to do .
not in india . now there are about half a million a million .
and i was thinking that somebody in this entire <unk> world has to think about the organization of <unk> .
and so we made us to do that .
listen to that : less than four percent of a percent of a percent of the people who were treated with their drugs or <unk> in <unk> , and it &apos;s about their treatment .
it &apos;s a try value , and i think it would be successful .
the <unk> are not <unk> .
when the <unk> is used , they &apos;re going to produce three watts of electricity . day and night .
and the people bring their green industries , hopefully their green restaurants , with the green school .
women from bali from bali and they use secrets , and they use secrets that only their grandmothers know .
we need somebody who comes from and <unk> .
green school is a model that we built for the world .
my tongue , <unk> and <unk> were still healthy and not <unk> . &quot;
then apple , apple <unk> , the best voice i &apos;ve heard about .
there was a reason for this : that &apos;s me .
the <unk> is not , of course .
but it doesn &apos;t happen .
at the same time , the internet was a <unk> tool . now it &apos;s something that i &apos;m doing for my real , everyday life .
it &apos;s human , disease to ignore disease .
you all know the test for artificial intelligence , the <unk> .
before , i was a architect , and my grandmother asked me , &quot; what are you alive ? &quot;
we used two <unk> pages than one side , because this is how the readers are true .
so what is the lesson ?
one day , my grandmother said , &quot; no , this time you &apos;re not going to do it .
it <unk> and terrible things happened to me .
all lost hope in my cure .
so they went to her <unk> , and all of their <unk> furniture -- they gave me <unk> and <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , everything .
they don &apos;t know how far away this road is , and they don &apos;t know if they go sick and they hear cars , and they had a terrible crash , and they had a terrible crash that they &apos;ve done in this way .
i thought that , for some reason , the time has been done , and only for family and friends .
for example , the understanding of molecular structures .
he took me to the <unk> of <unk> .
can we say , we &apos;ve been discovered all the symmetries of the tropics ?
i can &apos;t turn it out because i &apos;ve got a little <unk> , isn &apos;t it ?
if i put a magic train , and then there &apos;s another one , and then it &apos;s got a third .
galois has a series of laws , like these fields , these symmetries , these symmetries , interact .
one of these symmetry we call <unk> .
instead of all the <unk> , i want to know how many places that have number the number . ok ?
i need your house . journalists objects have seen -- please <unk> him for me .
first of all , rare diet , maybe <unk> <unk> .
thomas kelly would have had been <unk> in a prototype of today .
and it &apos;s been inspired by <unk> , but even in <unk> , there was no <unk> , and <unk> useful amounts of it .
it was the origin of the <unk> , the last year , the last year , the last year .
for me , the study of <unk> consequences that chaos now happens now . let &apos;s do the best of that .
for every computer and browser . coke , coke , gold and the text is going to be smaller , and the text is going to be smaller .
they don &apos;t need to <unk> them .
and so this is a kind of information that i &apos;m trying to inspire me , my real desk .
one of them would be like something like an <unk> , so that you &apos;re going to be able to be able to get the more traditional enemy . the things are <unk> in the grid .
now , i &apos;m going to go to my music with the heart of people , and there &apos;s no borders more .
but i think the point is , it &apos;s <unk> , and we want to be able to describe the role of blue mathematics today that we &apos;re doing a little bit about the role of extreme mathematics -- not only <unk> , but mathematics in general .
and he said , &quot; well , there &apos;s 2,000 physicists today at the wall street , and i &apos;m one of them . &quot;
you can find them here : this is a book about flies that maybe you might be on amazon .
that &apos;s not <unk> ; that &apos;s culture .
you can get it very , very far .
and it &apos;s not the money that &apos;s actually so interesting .
it goes . shake . thank you .
i want to tell you a secret .
so , <unk> without water , so with <unk> , save many lives , but there &apos;s a <unk> <unk> of them .
the answer is to allow cars to be safe from this side of the road .
warren jazeera had this <unk> : honestly to say what &apos;s going to do , and what &apos;s not going to do and make this to a national thing .
in fact , we see that the only known disease is that it &apos;s the only known disease , because of africa in africa , people have a lot of things to make the <unk> .
this means that the economy in these areas , there is just so much <unk> .
but it &apos;s not going to be <unk> .
not only she was weak ; it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
a teacher of the upper buttons will be the performance of his classroom -- in a year , <unk> -- in a year , about 10 percent .
but it &apos;s not in any relationship to be a better teacher .
&quot; what happens here ? &quot;
and this <unk> , could not only be available in the internet , but you can also be able to make cooperation everywhere , so every one with access to a <unk> <unk> can have the best teachers .
government vessels , like this cup , needs eight to 10 hours to the <unk> .
the <unk> richard <unk> talks about how he thought , as a young artist , he was a painter , and he died after his school school .
if i look at these photographs , i <unk> the smoke on my clothes when i went to my family home at night to my family .
my parents were great . they said , &quot; we know that you &apos;re scared , but let &apos;s go back tomorrow .
but is it so bad to think about it ?
this is part of general general in boston .
the <unk> takes the observations , <unk> it , <unk> it , <unk> it down under the microscope , and then the library of the library .
so , in this <unk> , a solution with these <unk> molecules , together with a <unk> , there &apos;s green , in the <unk> of one of the things that we can be able to have normal tissue , a normal tissue can &apos;t react to these molecules .
with <unk> <unk> as part of our today , the surgeon &apos;s <unk> , the surgeon after the individual <unk> , the <unk> , where the cancer starts .
if nerves are going to breathe , they can use motors , and pain .
if we <unk> these two samples .
we know that this is abstract , and we &apos;re trying to realize this .
and this cell is one of the thousand different <unk> that we learn to learn .
it &apos;s going to change the healthy circuits as the <unk> , like the sick that they want to fix .
and one morning in the summer of 2004 , we were trying to do it , and it &apos;s the first time .
we &apos;ve shown that already a quick <unk> of these cells to learn to learn .
and it goes . now .
i want to end with a story of what we believe , it might find clinical application .
now , you can see that the animal is actually the walls and the small platform , and it can use your eyes back .
buildings are <unk> in the air of <unk> microbes that are <unk> through the window of the window and <unk> .
and if you go out out , the air is the air of microbes that are going to be related to <unk> and <unk> .
obviously , i &apos;m a very powerful person , like you see , so i didn &apos;t worry , so i didn &apos;t worry about this thing about 20 blocks .
so the question for the question , who was in my neighborhood of 11 , the streets of my neighborhood in my neighborhood ?
and you can get a list .
one of these things that i &apos;ve been talking about is something called google , basically , you just take a fun term , and you &apos;re looking at google after google , and then you &apos;re looking at these things after the names of somebody .
this is <unk> <unk> . i mean , ok , interesting .
if you have the second side here , you &apos;re going to take one of the most .
what all of us was normal years ago -- the question of stories between generations -- is already rare .
in 1980 , the film was older than most of the grandparents of our members .
was it good for the story ?
why don &apos;t we see that we don &apos;t see the same passion like to read ?
in california , they &apos;re going to come up with a <unk> , &quot; this product is made chemicals that exists from the state of california as an <unk> of cancer , <unk> and other <unk> . &quot;
so we might be able to develop a <unk> , the humility , and for my job as an architect , it &apos;s a <unk> , that the words &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; architect , &quot; since &quot; the eternal <unk> , &quot; no longer was mentioned in the same german .
i don &apos;t know if you remember his answer , but it was like , &quot; the <unk> didn &apos;t end up because we &apos;re going to get the rocks . &quot;
and that can be very good for berlin , but we &apos;re going to be built in <unk> , and all the windows are closed . and with all kinds of products that obviously didn &apos;t use for the use of <unk> , it &apos;s actually a vertical <unk> .
if we look at the word competition , i &apos;m sure most of you use it .
since we &apos;ve got the 4,000 of the most vulnerable <unk> <unk> in a database that we &apos;re going to have a database that we &apos;re going to be able to do in six weeks of the public .
now , we &apos;ve got 800 pounds of hard <unk> the <unk> of the internet .
we started the national and <unk> use of buildings , so all of the people in the world and places where they can be .
and this is the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and that &apos;s not true . let &apos;s tell you about anybody that we knew that we &apos;ve done all of us , because we didn &apos;t know it .
for example , you &apos;re going to give you that the <unk> <unk> at india at the age of 11 university university , and then the other one : google , facebook , rob , brown , apple , apple , apple and so forth .
i met sweden because sweden are similar laws , like the united states .
and who &apos;s always told them , he doesn &apos;t have to hide it , not a long time .
and they had read , and she was talking at the <unk> , and she said , &quot; if there is no right to come on privacy , it can &apos;t be real <unk> , and that &apos;s why there is no sustainable democracy . &quot;
many people , if you look at the first time you see a thin human brain , say , &quot; usually , it looks different when you get a brain . &quot;
all of these empty areas are the areas that are going to go through .
and the nature of a particular cell , it &apos;s essentially <unk> , it &apos;s based on what the 25,000 genes are sitting on , and that &apos;s what number they &apos;re going to be on .
now , experts are going to go to the game and make fundamental <unk> .
we take the <unk> material and put it on a so-called <unk> .
so what can scientists learn from this data ?
they look at their entire genome , and they &apos;re trying to find <unk> , to find the <unk> of the genes with the genes .
whether that &apos;s from the individual genetic background or their experience , we don &apos;t know .
that we know how we can get poverty , we need to do more for that ?
so there are some more questions here .
how do you know it ?
so what is the problem ?
all right , before was all the same .
and there were many experiments that have done all the experiments that all the same result was , so i &apos;m just going to tell you about one of you .
so what is the best ?
we need this kind of information . we need more about it , and we need to be the politics .
and maybe we &apos;re going to take small , with things where we &apos;re sure they &apos;re doing .
poverty is more <unk> than scientific beings , and a lack of data about the implications of <unk> , the question is how to do this . but <unk> <unk> says , it &apos;s possible to help the <unk> , and the damage -- with aid <unk> studies .
so we start thinking , because africa is , in a certain way , in <unk> .
and the <unk> told that alexander through this desert .
but you could say , &quot; invest in africa with about 1,000 languages , and it wouldn &apos;t move . &quot;
so let &apos;s look at the countries , and the specific materials and data .
i want to talk about the perspective of <unk> .
in tanzania , last week , last week , the sun was going to be in life .
if i wanted to ask them , &quot; what was in the year in 2005 , the world of the world &apos;s <unk> ? &quot; would you think about egypt ?
because there &apos;s fascinating possibilities .
&quot; god , &quot; is the journey that we &apos;re all going to be inspired to be inspired , and to feel one with the universe that &apos;s living .
you <unk> a bubble -- there &apos;s electrical light .
i don &apos;t know why , but that &apos;s what they thought .
i &apos;m going to go to that , so you can make that kind of <unk> , and i &apos;m going to describe my reactions when i saw that for the first time .
right .
ok , are you , raise the right hand .
kt : yeah .
kt : no , no . i just see on the street .
i couldn &apos;t see it through the <unk> .
again , again .
kb : how often do you feel that ?
let &apos;s go to your eyes , in five , four , three , two , two , one .
so , if you want the pressure , you &apos;re going to make a <unk> , it &apos;s like , but only if you want to say that the pressure was <unk> .
do you want to try it ?
and it &apos;s actually a particular thing , and if you feel the extraordinary thing , i want you to see that they &apos;re going to put the <unk> in the bottle .
there &apos;s another thing that i want to share with you .
right ?
my hand is , here , in <unk> .
kb : ok . think about it here , yes or no ?
first of all , keith barry : how our brain can <unk> our bodies -- with a trick that is used by <unk> , and then he <unk> the audience in a couple of <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m <unk> .
this is not for the &quot; one of teenagers , &quot; this is all four .
i noticed that both religious as well as <unk> people have been obsessed with morality .
the <unk> is almost in zero , if there &apos;s no <unk> <unk> .
and then you get the answer of the computer : &quot; person 1 has got this amount of money .
we showed that the gift of oxytocin is about 80 percent of the psychology of <unk> <unk> to 80 percent .
i only have found the molecule .
he asked me , &quot; what should we do ? &quot;
in experiments , we &apos;ve got men <unk> .
and that tells us that we invented this ritual to connect us with this new dimension .
and it &apos;s very easy to get a brain to <unk> .
to get the machine to walk , you need many , many people .
or should you do this about that ?
they said pretty much , &quot; you &apos;ve got a device who &apos;s just going to work on english , so we &apos;ve been talking about english that we can use him to use it . &quot;
i decided to destroy my own argument , because i made a film statement .
<unk> . but i had to follow the <unk> norm .
how will it be tomorrow ?
we need to do this <unk> , from threat to joy .
i think it &apos;s right here in the end of this .
i said , &quot; when was the beginning of the world , &quot; when was the beginning of the world ? how will you end ? &quot;
and only one last thing .
maybe we should go to the next piece , because i &apos;m going to be totally lost .
<unk> went to local <unk> <unk> , and found that he found that he was <unk> in the arm of <unk> .
so this is the area of <unk> .
<unk> is in the <unk> layer that is able to pay multiple <unk> to numbers and thousands of houses , awful .
after these four children , you can see <unk> younger sister who have killed their children who were used to be killed .
and finally , there was a single person who was sitting for me , and i was going to put it up with his <unk> , so i had to <unk> him , so he had to be <unk> .
and after 16 , the kids have to go to the orphanage , even though they can be nowhere else .
one of the interesting things is , of course , is the combination of the happiest hand on the instrument and the technology , and of course , what he told about the listening to our young people .
now , my career might be a long time .
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
it comes out of the sound of the sound .
or we &apos;re doing this , and you think that &apos;s what blindness is .
rain . not bad . not bad .
so , <unk> . but why can i &apos;t do that if i &apos;m learning a piece of music ?
in this time , <unk> <unk> shows the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , why the listening of music is much more <unk> than the sound of music .
and it became so big , until the point where there was a <unk> last year at <unk> <unk> <unk> , and rick <unk> <unk> and &quot; <unk> , &quot; millions of people in television .
but this is not the interesting thing about this .
ag : you &apos;ve been lucky , that it &apos;s not going to be <unk> to them .
and eve and love was mentioned .
ts : yeah , but they still don &apos;t know what to think about it .
this is 10 times longer than the mammals needed to achieve their <unk> body and all of these crops .
we &apos;re looking at the dinosaurs very , and they are dynamic in our <unk> research .
in fact , it &apos;s a country that didn &apos;t have <unk> in the beginning of our work .
this is a <unk> <unk> in his belly .
<unk> : paul has never seen a choice like this .
these are all <unk> . there &apos;s a series of possibilities .
i became artists and started to draw .
the question is -- and we &apos;ve been talking about this question since centuries -- how to do these children in science .
bad news for <unk> , but some other of the world had been the same idea , beneath the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which is a <unk> , with the fastest <unk> of all the time .
let me give you a animal with <unk> and <unk> , and then it has to do something with water .
we &apos;re not used our physical strength , because we &apos;re the biggest <unk> in the <unk> .
well , emily <unk> -- one of 500 <unk> and <unk> -- they end up on the crowd , under the best 10 , even though they have done on all the <unk> <unk> to <unk> their baby -- and <unk> <unk> .
that &apos;s all we could do .
but maybe it &apos;s different .
look at the focus on these <unk> , where you didn &apos;t have , if you need four hours .
now , i was trying to interact with things with things , not with people -- with security , not in a social way who would be , of course , and people would actually help people to accept robots as part of our everyday life .
the <unk> is very , very bad .
the <unk> was a <unk> from our group where they were three of three different technologies to interact with the people to interact with the people .
and with this technology , you can be able to become the active participants in life , in a way of how it &apos;s not possible today .
and the third way was a simple driver with glass and pen , because this is the <unk> that you &apos;re using , if you use a <unk> and <unk> .
another important idea is this notion of the <unk> <unk> of the character .
i &apos;ve got some kind of <unk> , <unk> , really hard , because it &apos;s not going to be <unk> , it &apos;s not going to be able to be <unk> .
in the way , it &apos;s not far . i have fire : &quot; <unk> ! &quot; the <unk> is coming between two <unk> cars .
when he wrote to a <unk> , i was in front of the door .
i &apos;m going to show a number of photographs and movies , but i also do <unk> , books and a little <unk> , all with the same concept .
from photography , this <unk> is going to be <unk> , it &apos;s the desire and <unk> . what you don &apos;t want to do , you want to get more .
and as you go into the collective consciousness , without that we know that we know , and how that happens .
it &apos;s very <unk> .
and then you use the photograph that it is , and suddenly it &apos;s going to be really serious , and maybe less <unk> .
95 percent of the global <unk> for heart disease is not in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the tools in the west .
just to treat . look at the way that you &apos;re able to be able to deal with .
but if you told them , we &apos;re trying to do the same in nigeria , and then all the <unk> .
it allows the existence of <unk> centers , and we can use the experience very smart .
it has to be a part of the solution -- that &apos;s important .
and we &apos;re starting to start a <unk> design program that we can use their own people who can fix the equipment .
evolution has a very big range of a very large range of very large -- the child has not developed language -- to brilliant scientists and engineers .
i love the film , as you know , what you &apos;re going to do with all my projects . this is the <unk> in me .
well , what i learned was because i was not so <unk> to sell my work , and not myself .
another thing is the visual problems .
in other words , a problem with the equipment of a <unk> .
this is the film , in the movie , is called <unk> .
i made <unk> during the <unk> . this is what i built things and learned how to do tasks .
another very <unk> idea is to help children from some of the many of the people who are <unk> .
<unk> : i have passion for that the things that i do to do is improve the world .
it &apos;s a <unk> reality that &apos;s going to look at the <unk> and systems , or just a digital storyteller .
the fifth time i &apos;m sitting on this coast , the <unk> <unk> , and i believe that i &apos;m going to make it out on the time , and i believe that i &apos;m going to create it all the way around the <unk> , dangerous wild of a ocean .
but it was deeper , but how much life is there ?
and then there &apos;s our <unk> that you never say to me , as far as it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is , we don &apos;t know how far it is .
but honestly , all this talk that i had <unk> , just just to make the <unk> , they were very different .
thank you very much fun on the conference .
and this is perhaps the <unk> , he lost his taste .
he <unk> the army . the army has a <unk> .
so what happens when a medium , suddenly a lot of new ideas ?
they had to <unk> , and they had to <unk> what other obama knew . otherwise , you couldn &apos;t get the right kind of discussion .
but there was a <unk> , who decided that it was not the best way of work .
each of you can make change changes , and they can <unk> them to <unk> work , even if they didn &apos;t know about the existence of each other before .
this is called a &quot; <unk> , &quot; this thing is right here .
this is a <unk> that can happen to a culture , is that you can use a new <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , right now .
you don &apos;t understand what other things do to make a little bit better , because it doesn &apos;t make it very much .
and if you tell somebody , you don &apos;t hear it , you don &apos;t hear it .
six to nine months after 9 / nine months .
but we &apos;ve brought these rover back , before we <unk> them there -- or this is a rover -- and that &apos;s an rover -- and we have hope that everything works .
so we &apos;ve got a layer on the way to mars , and it &apos;s called <unk> . this is called <unk> . this is going to land in 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds , so you can see their <unk> .
and that would be bad .
we &apos;re talking about this , as we &apos;re talking about the next rover that we want to send to mars .
and i know many of you have seen the last time that these <unk> are really cool things .
there was two <unk> , which was particularly interested in it .
it &apos;s as similar as the <unk> on earth , but because it &apos;s so cold , it can &apos;t be the water , because water would be frozen .
today , i want to talk about how these innovation are unique technologies .
so we look at how biology is changing technology .
this is an example of this <unk> .
there are about wireless <unk> .
and i think many of these technologies are going to help us make better with our patients to be connected to our patients , and to take us more time to explore human elements of medicine that are used through this kind of technology .
but the current trend in medicine is , but to be exponentially smaller .
so , we &apos;ve been working on that , when 10 years ago , the first human <unk> had been done , the cost of a billion dollars , the cost of a billion dollars .
so blogs like <unk> <unk> like me or the <unk> of their data on <unk> , or google health , it &apos;s always more important , all of these possibilities will use in a <unk> way of the way .
we use the cells out of the <unk> to treat a patient with heart disease , and we realized a <unk> <unk> and higher <unk> , who is <unk> of their own <unk> cells for a heart of heart .
my poem is called &quot; <unk> . &quot;
their cats , god knows how many of the things that <unk> on their <unk> , their <unk> , a <unk> <unk> .
how do you get the <unk> <unk> , on the stage to the street , <unk> , <unk> , i don &apos;t look at me , &quot; can you help me ? &quot;
i was afraid , a <unk> part of me would come out of control , and i would be sitting in the <unk> <unk> of their <unk> .
but i &apos;m convinced that <unk> comes from , and i &apos;m looking at his <unk> .
if we love to love it all around me , i &apos;m there to be there , and i &apos;m not there .
we &apos;re looking for images that are attention to critical issues , images are the <unk> , these religions are <unk> , the religions that represent us to do something with other words : to act and do something with other words .
in &apos; 80s , the <unk> of this disease was an enormous obstacle to talk about this disease , or to mention this disease , or it &apos;s also to mention .
barry little : photographs that changed the world
i was going to read a lot of books and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
i was able to see that , as i saw the flag in the wild , you know -- charles , <unk> moment , and the music was going to be a <unk> moment , and the music went to a <unk> .
finally , at the morning , at the morning , we got the <unk> . we <unk> the helicopter -- two helicopter in the <unk> -- that i was on the edge of the <unk> .
i knew there were more open water . and i had a <unk> .
i had thought that , but i had thought about it .
this was the view of my tent when i got this <unk> call .
and only from the air , i saw the green .
and they were trying to go back to the coast of the coast , and all five died on the <unk> .
and that said a famous man , so that &apos;s a lot of .
but a few days later , we thought about our students , and we said , &quot; what would happen if this <unk> guy didn &apos;t have been in this state ?
one day in the years of <unk> <unk> miles from the coast of the west , in one of the most popular regions of the pacific regions in one of the world , in the middle of the ocean .
but in a certain point , most people learn to give these visions , and they &apos;re going to be <unk> .
they have the same structure .
some of us tend to read their fears more than others .
my head is afraid of an amazing gift of imagination , a kind of <unk> in the everyday life , a way to look at the future in the future , if it &apos;s time to change their appearance .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
we took them in every living world of arab world -- international , global , through our english administration .
they were surrounded by their people , from the brain , and now we see them , one after the other .
thank you .
because we discovered that the people are thinking , and people want to be <unk> -- they get the <unk> through our internet .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; i &apos;m like , and i see the needle on me , and i see the needle on me , and there &apos;s all the blood .
you want to share a needle right now like you want to share a toothbrush , even with someone you want to share with them .
so this is one of the things that &apos;s about hundreds of studies of all the <unk> in the united states in the united states , and this is the studies that show us that <unk> are effective , pretty many of them .
so you can see these extraordinary images from africa .
let me say , oh yeah , great <unk> .
<unk> is a <unk> <unk> on the streets . it &apos;s a girl with warm .
she was 65 years old when i made this photograph of her .
hey , hey , black-eyed susie , hey .
and i &apos;m going to play a little clinic . this is a little <unk> .
we were talking to the car in <unk> , texas , where i spent my early childhood .
and mom was just like the car on the car .
let &apos;s take it together with this old song . i sing : there &apos;s a long white <unk> in heaven , i know .
and from the <unk> <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s going to go to the &quot; <unk> , &quot; <unk> , a instrument with <unk> body and <unk> , where the sound of sound .
well , that &apos;s easier to me as well .
we were not stupid : we had about five feet away a piece of <unk> .
and as a <unk> , i was thinking , the idea of why you don &apos;t have the oldest <unk> , the &quot; <unk> &quot; players , and they &apos;re using the latest technology ?
well , i think it &apos;s working because scientists are connected by a ethic .
it &apos;s important for something to see the place in the room , because it &apos;s critical , not in terms of where other things are , but in terms of this absolute notion of space that god was god .
and in a quarter of the universe was the only possible explanation that it has somehow create itself .
and you understand some things better than others , and so there is a <unk> <unk> and you can take , and you can take it , the politics is .
there &apos;s a different names that i was talking about two years ago , jonathan <unk> , who &apos;s <unk> his work in three different areas .
and it &apos;s just going to do it all there .
in five months , he &apos;s <unk> to experiment with a full <unk> .
it wasn &apos;t very successful . and so forth and so forth .
or philip glass or 58 11 or the chemical brothers , they all played out there , they all had their own <unk> de <unk> .
after two weeks , three weeks ago , four weeks ago , five weeks ago .
it &apos;s a little bit a little bit .
and it &apos;s a transition that &apos;s just as much as much with the identity of living living with the <unk> .
but the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of wealth is also showing the status of the <unk> , and when the family &apos;s family .
if we could reduce our definition of death to be the life , we might be able to think of death as part of our lives , and maybe death with something else as fear .
i wanted to finish my show with a dance ...
they talk about the world in the water , and the context , the relationship between darwinism and the fact that we &apos;re all <unk> are , less <unk> and that we can swim well .
ok , gordon , come on .
&quot; and now she has a <unk> . &quot;
eight years of american history , eight minutes of my show are just so over .
and jack <unk> says , &quot; i want to be a better person . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s do this world to be a better place if you can .
so i &apos;m going to give you the message to see the message : not <unk> .
where are the little little ? &quot;
this is where people have back back .
as you can imagine , it &apos;s one thing , an <unk> <unk> , but if you go into a museum , and he says , &quot; i don &apos;t think you don &apos;t think if i <unk> your <unk> , right ? &quot;
and you could tell my , there &apos;s a clue .
so we &apos;re <unk> and have a lot of <unk> , and we &apos;ve found complex different animals .
so now , we know that blogs in fact is a <unk> <unk> .
it turns out how could it be bigger .
we wanted to make a public architecture .
all of the water of the world will be in here , so we thought that after the water , we thought that after the water is moving through the water and water , you could also drink the building .
the <unk> was <unk> on a <unk> .
and then you come down in this glass .
before , and after that .
this is a guy from <unk> lake city city . so , this is what it looks like .
&quot; <unk> &quot; -- as if they were <unk> , you &apos;re going to be able to invest a <unk> .
it &apos;s not sure that this would be done , if the <unk> didn &apos;t have a woman .
by the way , &quot; coca-cola &quot; has to be the heart .
it turns out the news , you &apos;re talking about , if something is missing , like the people in the new york times did .
this particular plant is <unk> <unk> and other <unk> chemicals from the air .
the most of the time i &apos;m going to do is i have the morning , if i <unk> , for trying to figure out what &apos;s going to happen .
and then , remember , remember that as <unk> <unk> in a event , and it was <unk> ?
pm : are they met by resistance when they did this for the <unk> of their foreign community ?
when i was popular , only 13 women in other countries were <unk> .
thank you that they were working on us today .
malaria : there are eight countries in africa who could reduce their <unk> to 75 percent .
for <unk> , like this is a <unk> zone , and it &apos;s fair to tell me that i &apos;m going to be <unk> by this <unk> .
to be right now , today , in their health care , some of them , in those <unk> times , the <unk> , and in <unk> programs like the global fund .
in the opposite , it could save many lives of life .
if we take this metaphor of a genome as a program , you &apos;ve got to think that chris anderson is a <unk> thing , like jim watson , craig venter , and all of us .
you create something like a mobile phone , and in very abstract language , you describes this cell phone .
this is normal dna , which is what you &apos;re going to do for normal dna .
we put them down to make something salt , and it &apos;s almost <unk> , and they <unk> them , and during the <unk> <unk> , the short strands of <unk> the long and it creates a structure .
so this works really good , and you can build patterns and produce patterns , okay ?
you see , there are only four strands of <unk> , and you &apos;re sitting on them in front of them , which can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get out of other losses .
we have a very <unk> computer , where little changes -- tiny , individual mutations -- something that has created a quarter of a size , and it &apos;s something much bigger .
and they &apos;ve been <unk> , and we &apos;re going to understand this , and to understand it better , as feynman said , as feynman said , we need to build something to understand it .
but as we looked at it , we had three <unk> : an <unk> <unk> , which is completely <unk> , which is completely <unk> , and <unk> <unk> for everyone with a medical scientist , regardless of its resources .
in the modern time , where time is a big good , and the battle of survival is about survival , is the ordinary <unk> of human beings , and you &apos;re going to pay the <unk> to come around .
in my last 18 months as a lawyer , in the battle against little and big <unk> , the case of india and big <unk> , the case of india .
sm : well , the <unk> cost were less than 200 rupees .
this is the global footprint of all over the last four years , which is the last four years in the entire world , from new york to a small new york in the corner of the corner .
and in one of these kinds of content , we &apos;re going to do a couple of things to make it easier to make it easier .
so we use these <unk> , to find unique talks , which is that , in creative ways , many different fields of these things that are much more for their history , and that &apos;s the fact that really creative , and those that are really creative between <unk> fields of bridges .
no wonder that it &apos;s my colleague , because the truth is hard to be honest .
the work of the <unk> could be as well in a hospital , like in a hospital , like in a hospital .
in ted is <unk> biology .
how does this stuff happen ?
secondly , for you <unk> <unk> nature of modern american education . <unk> , step forward .
and they said , &quot; would you be willing to have a <unk> in your community ? &quot;
it &apos;s not going to be able to achieve this . i teach more ethic in the world .
why ? because they &apos;re happy to do something that &apos;s right .

the <unk> , <unk> , was under zero in 2008 , just about the crisis .
you can hear the thoughts of the <unk> .
and at the same time , the solution is , because these are not to change the human nature .
we need to be , in fact , in the idea of a dynamic prosperity that the possibility of the possibility that people are doing .
first , it &apos;s supposed to be <unk> , so we could never have to be able to be able to be able to make something <unk> .

and there we put together , and we <unk> , and we <unk> , which was going wrong there . everest .
<unk> about this , <unk> about this , talking about , and a hundred percent , because there &apos;s only very , very few things that can &apos;t be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to use our entire power .
this is a <unk> . it &apos;s a very simple <unk> computer .
can we get a kind of <unk> ?
now , what i &apos;m going to show you here is that we can create a <unk> -- the b -- <unk> from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules .
these are three minutes .
and if you saw amy smith , they talk about how to meet students at mit , with communities in haiti .
and it likes to be aware that all of the things that are amazing about reality , and it &apos;s connected to that , also , the variety of problems we need to solve .
we &apos;re going to be increasingly aware that we don &apos;t even have to put the entire <unk> .
okay . i also have one .
can we go back with the natural ecosystems around us through the natural ecosystems , by the example of rivers , and the <unk> ?
as you can see , the revenue of 58 deaths per conflict per city per year in the 1950s to 2,000 deaths per conflict per city per year in this decade , so horrible this .
because we &apos;ve done something right now , and it would be good to figure out what it is .
they want the <unk> .
if not , one of the two , you don &apos;t have to stop one of the two , right ?
the developing countries used <unk> and water , <unk> .
and now i &apos;ve got the <unk> on this axis .
and they remember the beginning of the last century , which was very bad . until this is what we call a lot .
do you see how it grows ? and how hundreds of millions of millions and billions of millions of poverty in asia ?
here we are . we have a continuity in the world .
look . this is the world .
they get clean water . they buy food for the poor . they <unk> malaria .
and we need to figure out how to look at the world with facts .
don &apos;t do it in africa , and you don &apos;t do a <unk> of it .
it &apos;s not sustainable . and it &apos;s not going to be able to be able to be able to be able .
and many of you have the term &quot; memes &quot; -- the evolution of technology is something that i &apos;m very much <unk> , so you know , one of the first things that you had was a little <unk> .
my argument is basically that , you know , it &apos;s always been part of our lives .
and this is pretty new , and i think it &apos;s a lot worse -- this possibility -- because of developments in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , in <unk> , which can be used as weapons as weapons or nanotechnology .
i do my best , okay .
&quot; <unk> is our <unk> , &quot; he &apos;s called the people <unk> <unk> , &quot; which was a pretty awful <unk> .
we only have been in six countries , which means the media is only about six countries .
so , how should we put our money together ?
no one of these countries , including africa &apos;s <unk> nation , has ever done his life .
and in this development , we &apos;ve been , the africans , in the edge of development , and <unk> of politics in our countries .
the <unk> , mostly <unk> , is <unk> billion .
we would like them to walk . &quot; and i said , &quot; great . &quot;
and now , 14 of thousands of diseases , two of them are even <unk> .
so in the last 10 years , and as hope for the future for the future , we &apos;ve seen the study of a science of positive psychology : a science of what the life is doing .
and i think there are three different things -- and i call them different , because it &apos;s possible for different interventions , it &apos;s possible to have one more than the other -- three different happy life .
but it turns out that there was no sexual explosion .
you don &apos;t look like <unk> <unk> .
and what you &apos;re finding is that if you do something fun , the <unk> is going to be <unk> .
when i was <unk> 30 years ago , i thought , if i was good enough to do somebody else , i didn &apos;t know if i was good enough to do it .
one says , in the arctic , in the arctic , was <unk> by paul <unk> .
but this is called &quot; <unk> , &quot; if all of these parts , and not only the event , but my emotional connection is going to come up .
nick -- again with a <unk> camera -- has thousands of photos of this shot .
sometimes you can tell a <unk> story .
we want to find solutions as well .
and then , it &apos;s kind of all the time and <unk> .
thank you .
what &apos;s more important , because this is a <unk> process that you can see in only three seconds : we can see emily in a period of less than a single afternoon in multiple different <unk> and <unk> .
emily : image <unk> is a <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
after all , i was going to go back to it .
in the amazon , there &apos;s a couple of beautiful primates .
but i was from the west and worked in the east .
all over all of the things were <unk> , animals were killed , they killed the woods , and so on .
this is called <unk> , and gold .
one day , we met us with the <unk> .
the elephant <unk> just , and they took the <unk> .
i don &apos;t think somebody sees google google , because google makes the right , even if people use <unk> google , to connect .
<unk> <unk> : a hero of the <unk> of congo
we &apos;ve got us , almost without it to have noticed , from a market , to be able to move out of a market .
they don &apos;t have to pay it from their budget .
i wanted to <unk> them , what happened to this experiments .
democracy doesn &apos;t need perfect equality , but they need citizens who share a living life .
<unk> the united states as an <unk> nation in 1900 , where the line is to red .
we &apos;ve got this gift in the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s , when women were going to go back to <unk> .
it was also useful in the <unk> of women .
one amazing fact for <unk> is that in the first half of the 20th century , in the first half of the 20th century , there are three times as fast as in the second half of the 19th century .
this was the book that i wrote to 11 years ago , and i got one of the <unk> .
i have some of the people who came up for five and 15 , and 15 to 15 , and that led to a sense of failure .
so if i look through creativity , i think it &apos;s also because this sense or the <unk> , that i see between most of all in life .
this is what we &apos;re going to say <unk> , because they don &apos;t have to kill a living life .
and they &apos;re going to understand it more .
and i had to figure out what to do about history .
how are we going to <unk> what the responsibility and the belief is , outside of a dish ?
and they need to be in all possibilities , including the ones that i &apos;ve never seen before .
i hope you &apos;re looking at me when i &apos;m doing this examples , because i &apos;m talking about everything that you could spend their time .
now there &apos;s <unk> over water .
people pay the full price for both , and the only thing you have in common is that they have nothing in common .
the sea <unk> , on the middle of the middle , that &apos;s the big market .
these guys <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the world .
but you don &apos;t have to be <unk> -- you don &apos;t have to be completely <unk> .
so what you need to do is figure out who it &apos;s interested .
nine months later , i &apos;m going to <unk> messages on the <unk> , and this was a picture that i saw in my <unk> .
thank you .
but also , of course , the cultural projection in us to go into us and go to the past .
my first describe for national geographic , where i realized that you can do problems in a question about the story of nature , i had <unk> <unk> .
these are the lions and <unk> of the ocean .
and because i love sharks -- i &apos;m kind of fascinated by them -- i wanted to give a different , more positive story about sharks to talk about the need of protection for sharks .
after i met <unk> , i learned that this habitat is going to be <unk> to create a new <unk> .
they &apos;re also <unk> in <unk> .
but when the fish came back and come back to <unk> , and the population , there were <unk> forests of <unk> in the flat water , in the <unk> water .
it lives now in the <unk> of <unk> , and this is <unk> , and this is <unk> , you know , the son of the second pigs , the son that i had saved , <unk> .
it was a biological desert .
and then you see the <unk> , and it starts to measure what it comes from .
so how do we move this <unk> ?
and you need bacteria to <unk> the nitrogen , and without these crops , there will be no performance .
it &apos;s 10 percent higher .
so we can actually change the climate .
in <unk> , it &apos;s the <unk> , there &apos;s a democratic culture , so you can use the capacity to protect the own system .
the <unk> <unk> , which is a <unk> <unk> on a <unk> <unk> .
i &apos;m going to show you one .
<unk> <unk> creates <unk> sculptures , beautiful <unk> , who moved in the pattern of <unk> , or <unk> waves , and in nine minutes , he <unk> us with his <unk> art -- at the same time , of mathematics and nature .
every city has their own design .
six years later , they asked us to come out and get this idea .
this is the van <unk> , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the <unk> park , the bush park .
i &apos;m going to talk about consciousness .
it doesn &apos;t change it or it &apos;s something else , a computer program or something else , but not a case of science .
people always say that consciousness is hard to define .
you can &apos;t forget about the existence of their own consciousness .
it &apos;s a digital computer program in the brain and to create consciousness , we have to find the right program .
we &apos;re trying to get the <unk> and <unk> as the characteristics of reality , and as the properties of <unk> .
you don &apos;t know ?
but i also meet people who do what they &apos;re doing , love , and they couldn &apos;t imagine to do something else .
we don &apos;t teach american history in britain .
teenagers don &apos;t wear <unk> .
maybe soon , not .
no , don &apos;t .
i couldn &apos;t afford this thing to work , not how often , or how much a lot of it .
but we need to change from a industrial model to a <unk> , in the morning , in the morning every single school .
<unk> and i wanted to figure out more about it .
the reason for this is that the historical report is going to be <unk> in <unk> .
and so she came up with a light . she said , &quot; okay , it &apos;s serious .
it led to a group of students in the streets of the streets in the streets .
i stood up with a tea , sat down , and all i am here , and now i am here -- still almost paralyzed , but here .
so this is going to be <unk> <unk> , so that &apos;s the back of the back .
he wrote a book called &quot; by the <unk> to democracy , &quot; with <unk> power to <unk> resistance .
it &apos;s not such a <unk> thing .
in fact , chris and said , &quot; look at this photograph , you don &apos;t look at this photograph , you &apos;re going to think that you &apos;re going to be one of these crazy modern artists who are not going to do much . &quot;
it &apos;s a object for the mind .
and the solution that i <unk> , is that the biggest <unk> in this massive <unk> of earth through humanity and the <unk> destruction of the biosphere .
so , i said , &quot; what would &#93; t -- &quot; we call it <unk> , where they <unk> the effects , in the <unk> -- we call it <unk> , where they <unk> the implications ? &quot;
and he was a powerful <unk> on the market that we have to have our genome and profit .
we &apos;re not going to be <unk> .
but five days later , back in atlanta , i got a email from joshua thomas , one of my people from the meeting in california .
so , open said many of us who are working in the industry that we &apos;re working in the industry with technology , and maybe it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
and in fact , we need somebody to give somebody to give us a experience with a <unk> <unk> ?
the arts , what they &apos;re doing is that we &apos;re going to be able to look at all of us when they <unk> us , to look at our <unk> and curiosity .
the three sisters <unk> <unk> with her healthy music in the <unk> new life , and on <unk> , they start with <unk> and <unk> &quot; <unk> &quot; by david <unk> . i &apos;m going to play a <unk> , <unk> version of <unk> <unk> . &quot;
it &apos;s called <unk> <unk> , after my quarter .
he &apos;s doing a bunch of money through the <unk> of special furniture for rich people .
we &apos;ve been able to get the <unk> of the american <unk> , which is in their sense of the harvard institute , and we <unk> a <unk> for mothers in <unk> in this <unk> in the middle of the middle of the middle of the city .
we have noticed that you have to give them flowers and sunlight and food and expectations and <unk> , and so you can all cure the spiritual cancer .
these kids who have been given from public schools who fly from public schools , and that &apos;s what they can do , with <unk> and sunlight and food and good music .
and it has been working on this time today .
and i &apos;m going to give you the concert , and i &apos;m going to give you the music , and i would never decide to sell them to sell them a form that tells you that the money will be used to be used for the school . &quot;
this is a room that was built by nancy wilson &apos;s <unk> , which was <unk> in our school last last month .
the brown building is what you looked at , and i tell you where i did my biggest mistake .
he came back to me . he said , &quot; oh , this is an amazing story .
and so he had a group of people <unk> .
bill <unk> : a <unk> and amazing story of <unk> by art , music and unusual <unk> .
and the <unk> , then the <unk> , the code , the code on the brain , and the result is a <unk> , which is the result of a normal <unk> .
but there was the <unk> factor , the problem with the code , and how you could make cells better answers to make normal reactions , and that was our contribution .
it <unk> us with a invisible <unk> , the <unk> of the environment of the environment , so that we &apos;re healthy .
but if the bacteria grow up and count all of them to make these molecules , then the number of molecules , then is the number of molecules outside the cell to the <unk> .
now we know that all bacteria can talk to each other .
this is just a photograph -- a <unk> of your skin .
bacteria are incredibly <unk> , which is that we &apos;re going to kill with antibiotics that kill them with antibiotics .
the fact is that bacteria have a collective behavior , and that they are playing tasks that would never be able to be able to be able to be able to do it .
it &apos;s a big honor for me to come to this conference .
or the first one that comes in the room .
but , if we think about justice , aristotle says that what we need to think is the real character of the <unk> activity and properties that are worth that you &apos;re <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
what &apos;s the reason for a reason ?
charlie , what do you say to warren ?
here it is how he <unk> it .
this is what aristotle said to <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> question of the <unk> question of <unk> was right .
michael <unk> : the lost art of democratic
a lot of people said , &quot; well , you know , <unk> , they don &apos;t have a rural guy to tell us what we &apos;re supposed to do with our time .
and i think this is good -- the future of humanity can make a decision .
so if this is what does that mean for us ?
i &apos;m thinking that the speed of <unk> is going to be working .
i wish this is <unk> .
we know that there are these names , because we don &apos;t get <unk> , before we get a <unk> age , and that even though the <unk> has been <unk> since our birth <unk> .
that means you need to do your homework to understand whether this is true .
audience : hi . i read somewhere else in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of the average life has been in the planet for 10 years .
not one of their media has been doing this .
we &apos;re not thinking about how we &apos;re doing our profit .
they <unk> in the center of <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the performance .
but i can &apos;t have the <unk> , which is <unk> as the issues that i think of economists , horizontal and <unk> .
the <unk> is something <unk> , and probably you know a part of the <unk> .
4 students die per day of <unk> , who &apos;s going to be different like in the &apos; 90s , and almost everything comes from <unk> .
he was not a sense of humor .
and and we have been afraid of <unk> , <unk> <unk> as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
secondly , because we &apos;ve done them .
so we thought , &quot; let &apos;s try . &quot;
there &apos;s a couple of amazing animals .
in fact , the government said , &quot; it &apos;s enough -- that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to go . &quot;
he might think that he would have the <unk> baby ever born , so he might have a little help from the outside .
i asked peter if something changed . and he said , &quot; no .
we want to start with &quot; africa : the next chapter , &quot; and that &apos;s what it is : a healthy , <unk> , beautiful africans .
but in fact , they have to be productive in their life , and a kind of productive environment can create in our countries , so things can be done .
we can combine it all together ?
we were on the side of the <unk> .
i had to <unk> between the legs of these people , with my sister on my back to my sister to find a window .
you know , we need to use anything good .
and often , i don &apos;t see african employees under them .
the question is now , how do we use to use of all this good value that comes out of us ?
you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
we have <unk> <unk> in nigeria with the <unk> .
and with this idea that artistic creativity is effective as a <unk> product , i took this idea that we can study them , just like we can study any other complex <unk> process .
the method was designed since the 90s , to explore extremely complex processes .
i want to try to do this for you about that .
and then i &apos;m in the circles , here , games in change .
now , how do you talk about <unk> science ?
so there &apos;s a massive brain brain , rather than a massive brain that &apos;s involved in <unk> .
so , i want to tell you , biomimicry and statistics , that &apos;s the mathematics of games and <unk> .
this is very <unk> , and it &apos;s not just easier .
but keep the thoughts for the entire time of eight seconds .
in play and virtual worlds , for example , you can be used with their conditions of course and vaccines to control a <unk> or virtual character .
they <unk> them very quickly . and without a <unk> tumor , it &apos;s not possible , so kids die .
another statement of natasha was that we react when it comes to a tragedy like haiti , but this is a <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be made by the <unk> , and it &apos;s a very interesting <unk> substance .
we &apos;ve got every street , every village , almost every rock of madagascar .
in her <unk> is a very cheaper black <unk> .
audience : yeah !
what &apos;s interesting is , even though we have <unk> all the time , we &apos;ve never done it , we &apos;ve never been able to <unk> the <unk> in the air .
this is the restaurant <unk> house .
this <unk> that you see here is actually actually in a <unk> , which is in a <unk> , which was made by the outside and <unk> .
so , water is an important thing .
metal &quot; metal &quot; and &quot; earth . &quot;
the idea is still not <unk> .
they don &apos;t want to enjoy the show .
thank you .
i could show you this animal here .
once it <unk> the water , you should hear , like air .
once once we published these two genomes , we asked us : if this is the smallest genome of a <unk> species , is it possible because even there is a smaller genome ?
in fact , we realized that we were , once that , once that worked out , a real chance that we would have when we could get the synthetic chromosomes , it &apos;s the bacteria <unk> .
so , it &apos;s <unk> .
the last time is a quote from robert feynman , &quot; what i don &apos;t have to create itself , that i can &apos;t understand . &quot;
but in fact , we &apos;re very close to the actual idea of the <unk> of the <unk> of the battle , the 36 times as &quot; <unk> , <unk> by <unk> <unk> . &quot;
but the more you get more , the more that it seems to be lost .
and this number of 72 was never done .
this is a nest reef , and this is the river , and this is the river .
this is a colony that was developed by a queen in the <unk> summer .
the <unk> -- this is what &apos;s going to be like to be a <unk> -- are a interesting group , and they go out early in the morning before the first group of <unk> .
and interestingly , and interestingly , it looks like that , as if it &apos;s about half of the way that it doesn &apos;t do nothing .
and the nest , they just take all the <unk> , and they put them down to the <unk> edge of the <unk> and put them there .
but it &apos;s kind of not going to decide , not to get out .
and we &apos;ve done experiments , which shows that the longer the ant is coming out of the ant , the more likely the simple <unk> on their surface , and that &apos;s how the ants , the ants are different that they &apos;re doing different things that they &apos;re working on .
they <unk> the entire earth , depending on antarctica .
here you see that the cost of all of this for the world is about 20 million barrels of oil , and the <unk> cost about three trillion dollars .
and that &apos;s what we do for four percent of the world &apos;s population .
it doesn &apos;t have to do that .
i think about where we can use natural gas .
and when i get to the <unk> , it &apos;s <unk> by nine dollars .
why don &apos;t you worry about that ?
this is just 500 million <unk> .
this was never taken the <unk> or similar .
tbp : i &apos;ve lost 150 million in the wind , ok ?
some have 5,000 . many have a lot more .
there was <unk> . and there were <unk> .
<unk> life is a event . <unk> it &apos;s the world .
these are working in <unk> manhattan , where you built with the first <unk> .
this was perhaps six different colors .
i mean , you didn &apos;t want this thing to do this thing that this thing is <unk> .
a friend of mine told me this story : they didn &apos;t have to wait and wanted to wait , but then the <unk> , when they were there , for the third time , they had to call somebody call .
so , i &apos;m going to use a lot of clinical language , and so it &apos;s not going to be as much as much as long about the heart of the heart , as other issues about compassion .
and here &apos;s the basic idea that <unk> <unk> to good , for people who are going to be <unk> .
in fact , if you &apos;re my enemy or my <unk> , if you don &apos;t have my friend or my family , i have a lot of less to my family , i &apos;m going to use a lot less , the golden rule on them . okay .
so , like that , the results are going on . this is a <unk> .
every form of <unk> is <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that humanity &apos;s humanity &apos;s humanity .
and they explain to them , the other thing that america is not <unk> , and they don &apos;t even want to be <unk> , and they hate america .
most of the diseases of poverty , but in the case of cancer in children , the children who died in cancer , mostly from wealthy families .
a week died a child died , but nothing changed .
because you just don &apos;t have this kind of energy and time , if it doesn &apos;t really tell you .
so he didn &apos;t really want to say something .
openness is not the end .
now , the happiest <unk> would say that there is a single <unk> in one of the only cancer , and that this is what you &apos;re doing with a <unk> .
what does that mean ?
we found a kind of <unk> material , which is the right , we put the right , we put the cells in there and behold the cells ; in about four days , they were <unk> and right , and look at what we &apos;re doing in a culture .
and of course , we ask us now where we &apos;re going to go now ?
and so i want to finish with a poem .
we &apos;ve got a <unk> journalist that was taken to <unk> , and a boy <unk> , who was so many <unk> <unk> , that you had to put it out of the shelves , a <unk> <unk> in the new york times in the new york times .
it sounds a little bit like a <unk> book , but it &apos;s actually about new kinds of <unk> .
he wrote very , very positive developments about yourself . surprise !
you would have four good friends of a person with their personality .
that &apos;s really bad . why is it so bad ?
i can look at myself ; they were talking about it , and they were going to go .
they told how big it was , or they said , the <unk> are so much , and so far from the hotel .
google 2 : right there . okay , glass , make a photograph !
it &apos;s like you want to <unk> your eyes .
but it really took my eyes , as often as often , i &apos;ve taken me from life for drawings , social networks and so forth , although there was nothing really important or <unk> .
i read peter and the <unk> with this beautiful band of <unk> .
and every one that &apos;s <unk> , i went out .
at least for me , because if i just do the same thing , i &apos;ll be very , very careful , very boring . i &apos;m very quick .
i see myself as -- i don &apos;t know , as what i see me .
are you nervous , <unk> ?
im : do you worry about it ? you look like that cute .
in fact , i don &apos;t say that it &apos;s good , but only that it &apos;s not <unk> , ok ?
if you put the <unk> to a long time , it &apos;s <unk> .
i call it the era of <unk> -- which is where people are different <unk> or <unk> , but , as citizens are all going to be the same thing .
in egypt , i was beginning to be discovered .
this had been working in london , in yemen , and they &apos;ve been working in amsterdam a plane to go to america .
there are no ideas and narratives and symbols and symbols that are used for democratic culture on the ground .
as an example , we can show that when poverty was the only factor , well , it &apos;s the family of the richest families .
what happened there was a political <unk> , which was <unk> for a political goal , and that was to be able to use the leaders .
these tools are not going to be socially interesting when they &apos;re going to be useful .
he <unk> the boundaries of the individual networks and <unk> them .
and because of the social <unk> , the chinese students who were <unk> , or companies from the rest of the world the office in china , there were people on the world who heard these news .
and finally <unk> the chinese .
we &apos;re still more in a media in the media of global , socially , richer and cheap .
but all of all of the <unk> , i &apos;m going to be able to be able to be able to take it out like i was doing it .
and in my fourth <unk> , everest , i was taken in the hill of the mountain . <unk> .
this view is the <unk> . the first 600 meters of the <unk> of the caribbean .
and this is in the wall .
and there were climbers on this summit .
we also got the bad news that beck <unk> , a different climbers , in this wheel and died in the snow .
it &apos;s so <unk> to work there , and sometimes i was even <unk> by the clothing .
this climbers was <unk> .
and i can only <unk> how he did that .
and so he &apos;s going to move back to the same time .
these are <unk> , the <unk> structure .
and the fourth thing that &apos;s very important for me is very important , &quot; ideas that we need to do with . &quot;
but today , after 60 years , through the leaders , and they were entrepreneurs to make entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re living in a big amount of society .
it was <unk> people who wanted democracy , because they wanted to bring the ideas to <unk> , the universal <unk> , tibet and the constitution , and so forth .
the third thing is still the cities .
the second one is the <unk> that we have , we &apos;ve got so hard to create the tools to create and create materials in companies that have 350 percent of the indian jobs in the <unk> .
so , if you &apos;re a young country , you &apos;ve got the chance to do a modern <unk> . so that you don &apos;t have the <unk> , if you &apos;re going to be older .
you have to have a clear strategy , which is important for india and important for the world .
so the government is going to choose the government .
although some people on the left of the left doesn &apos;t expect it was actually the revolution of markets , which is called <unk> , &quot; the government doesn &apos;t know . &quot;
they don &apos;t fear the mass .
so , this whole <unk> <unk> between the <unk> and the ones that you can see .
<unk> .
every one of these <unk> would be <unk> , two years after the <unk> .
david cameron had about 20 million pounds in a &quot; social <unk> , &quot; to support this idea .
<unk> <unk> : investment in the social change
i &apos;ve been working . &quot;
why ? are you too tired to get back to <unk> ?
even if i &apos;m talking to my friend named jack there , i say , &quot; i thank you , jack . <unk> , jack . &quot;
if you haven &apos;t found it , my name is tom <unk> , and i &apos;m a <unk> . this means that i &apos;ve heard everything that you &apos;re just heard about , and it was just with my voice , only with my voice .
and at the same time , with this one of my right , i can tell my sounds <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
our people had to get about 5,000 different <unk> to find the right thing .
don &apos;t tell you the ones who say that , you can &apos;t do that . everybody can do that .
on the right side , it &apos;s a <unk> .
and i &apos;m going to give you a couple of examples .
you can see the blue <unk> <unk> .
his wife said it was &quot; the happiest day in your life . &quot;
many of these patients <unk> the <unk> .
the results are better than the interest .
he can stop the operation and they &apos;re going to stop .
<unk> street , i know .
and that &apos;s where they &apos;re doing very much of their creative inspiration , so it &apos;s a industry that &apos;s going to be in both directions .
and therefore , you want to go to the next trend , and that &apos;s how fast as possible .
and their jokes , like the <unk> of a <unk> , worked really only within this aesthetics .
you need a lot of lawyers and a lot of time ago , and the <unk> decided , and the <unk> decided that it was much too expensive .
these are the two <unk> <unk> in the logic of the <unk> of the <unk> .
and i want to think of this place <unk> <unk> , and i really want you to have this very <unk> presentation .
and finally , a boat took me to a remote <unk> , and i noticed that the <unk> that i was supposed to meet was not <unk> .
i think this is one of the <unk> and <unk> things on the planet .
there are numerous ancient <unk> on <unk> all over the u.k. , and if you end up , you &apos;re going to be able to imagine that the <unk> <unk> had been there .
here &apos;s the <unk> <unk> , which is about <unk> years old .
i hope that i can help these organisms , to help their remarkable <unk> attention , and to make my part to protect their <unk> longevity in the <unk> future .
let &apos;s take it into something else .
20 years later , <unk> <unk> , but they also create <unk> , but they also create their own <unk> , like this , which is going to be used by the <unk> <unk> in all 31 states .
what did they do ?
what could terrorists do today , where are the current technology ?
recently , i was arrested in the united states in the united states , who wanted these <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in the united states in the united states .
as we see here , we &apos;re using us in <unk> .
now , in fact , 95 percent , if you put it into it , but that &apos;s hard .
there are so many people killed that the only <unk> surgeon is not <unk> <unk> like this here , in the way outside of <unk> .
but at the other hand , i hear the people like you talk about fear , one of the <unk> of risk .
and it was arrested in 1999 when she was working in uganda with <unk> <unk> , with the goal , to get their culture and language , with two other colleagues from the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> and killed .
and there &apos;s no group that has been <unk> for this kind of <unk> than young men .
human capital is proud of the people who are looking at the simple solutions , weak categories , because we don &apos;t look at it as an instrument .
but the entire community , all different different <unk> , also the <unk> and <unk> , would come back and ask . &quot;
because to <unk> , when it &apos;s full of the <unk> , it &apos;s beautiful , it &apos;s green , they use the world , it &apos;s enough to be in the sky .
but no faces ?
ok , let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
i tried to do a little bit of my wife to make a little pleasure .
why am i not going to go to my wife , <unk> ?
but here &apos;s the problem . because a company is <unk> from cotton and it works .
<unk> : i see this thing in the hands of my wife , &quot; why don &apos;t you <unk> a <unk> ? &quot;
now you can access 110 countries . okay ?
and it was so beautiful that i had been there in the last seven years .
then i <unk> a huge amount of training . i swam in <unk> .
in fact , it actually happened that the cells in my fingers , and it &apos;s <unk> .
and my good friend david looked like me , and he came to me , and he came up to me and said , &quot; lewis , i know you were 18 years old .
the <unk> , you know , in 30 , 40 years , there might be a very <unk> .
england , america , japan , south africa , the congo .
it &apos;s about <unk> trillion feet in the earth today , which can be <unk> and <unk> .
now , the end of the story could be -- okay , we just replace that all of these things , renewable <unk> -- but i think that &apos;s still about that story is still more .
it &apos;s very special material that the <unk> itself , millions of <unk> , the entire time , every day , every year .
and the idea that was in principle was that i &apos;m going to be the <unk> in the hand of the great personalities that come and i would go .
but i wanted to go to interviews that are different .
in fact , my first <unk> was george <unk> , who was <unk> years old , and <unk> was full of life -- i think that &apos;s how to define it .
we know the big <unk> , we know the great moments , we know what we don &apos;t want to say , and the sense of the thing is to do nobody .
when we were alone , i was her <unk> .
it was not this <unk> , but it was a <unk> for my <unk> .
he said , &quot; but i understand that . i can understand this . &quot;
half of the body was <unk> , they don &apos;t have the other .
this is a <unk> in somalia , nepal , nepal .
i don &apos;t want to do beautiful things .
there &apos;s a particular way of treatment , it &apos;s called <unk> .
it &apos;s not the paintings that we &apos;d had , but that &apos;s what we did .
another example : again , a <unk> mother .
thank you .
no , we &apos;re talking about 10 million dollars , 20 million dollars on the swiss <unk> , on the <unk> of the president of the president , the <unk> of the president , the <unk> of the american areas .
they even <unk> the <unk> .
most of the big companies are already convinced that they need to be very <unk> , they need to have to use a very <unk> diet .
if you want to go to a restaurant , if you &apos;re going to look at the <unk> , you &apos;re going to expect it all on the map ?
and that was the first time i thought that the expression on your face is actually <unk> what it &apos;s going to be .
well , he <unk> his life .
so , the french painter in the 18th century was known for his <unk> , but it &apos;s also <unk> people .
unfortunately , this <unk> is now <unk> their most time with a series of other 2003 in the archive , and some of them are beautiful paintings .
so the first time i was in a <unk> dinner , who gave their parents to honor us .
&quot; i go to your <unk> wedding , james .
and my father was the most of the time in east africa .
i &apos;d like to show you six minutes .
<unk> <unk> : but our movies , they are stories that can identify our people .
so , there &apos;s a young man out there that can be able to be able to think about certain negative things , and all of this , or some <unk> behavior .
<unk> <unk> : so much to say , so little time .
i think this is really the theme of this event .
<unk> , you &apos;ve described this as <unk> <unk> of the world .
it &apos;s basically a cd . a <unk> .
now , <unk> . oh , that was fantastic .
that was really fantastic .
video games can be very profound , even if they &apos;re completely <unk> .
we show , &quot; <unk> , &quot; because you &apos;re going to get to the walls to create new rooms .
so time , space , aesthetics , and then , the most important , behavior .
at the way , i had to get a couple of bridges behind me .
all of this is based on the <unk> and students who said that the first meeting said that you &apos;re going to be a place .
so , i made some of these things on <unk> -- little boxes and <unk> things that i &apos;ve probably taken .
it &apos;s one of the most beautiful pieces i &apos;ve ever done .
this beautiful object , the swiss army , for me , is going to be <unk> .
and one day i had one -- oh , the <unk> .
i &apos;ve got the <unk> , and it &apos;s very thin , so it &apos;s <unk> .
and this is my <unk> .
and it reminded me why i think of things like my house , like my house <unk> .
she never had been completed .
the activity was a wish of <unk> .
it was a try , this little piece of country -- it &apos;s 30 to <unk> feet -- in a <unk> , to turn these areas , and the <unk> and <unk> in this <unk> <unk> , with a high space .
they call this &quot; plan <unk> . &quot;
here it is .
from the building in the background , it seems like <unk> <unk> in the mountains .
so we don &apos;t want the <unk> , so -- and when we met our new <unk> , he said that this is the right shape , or that &apos;s the right form .
in gando , i was asked to make a fish , we &apos;re going to work on the <unk> of the <unk> , which is the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
can we be able to create clean <unk> ?
and one of the things they found was that they didn &apos;t have <unk> .
and this is what we are doing in our <unk> .
and he has the problem of the health effects of <unk> wood and coal .
it &apos;s a place where for example , if this was india , in this room only three of us had a car .
so you can &apos;t use the same concepts like in the united states to bring things into the united states .
there &apos;s a big difference .
after a surgery , all of a surgery <unk> .
now , this is not surprising . but we asked them to be able to judge their <unk> and intelligence and <unk> .
he married . he had a son called <unk> .
is this business with our <unk> and our life , is a <unk> phenomenon ?
i want to tell a little bit about the surgeries that we &apos;re doing how far we are , and where we want to do .
we can replace the <unk> structure , but we &apos;re not very much very far at the <unk> of <unk> .
my theme is the food in schools , because this is about social justice .
and the next thing is <unk> .
people all talk about sustainability , but we should figure out what it is .
you know that all of you think they have to get more and more food ?
and they have <unk> , hey , we can sell the stuff on kids .
and this is a typical <unk> .
the things that we might like to do with home and so important , that we need to teach children in schools .
we need to meet the employees .
this eight billion , by the way , two dollars , and 120 cents -- so much money does the government for lunch for lunch .
as a little girl , my grandfather was sitting on a <unk> <unk> with me out in the sun .
if i go to a party , and people ask me what i &apos;m doing , and i say , &quot; i &apos;m a professor , &quot; your eyes are matt .
i want to get their <unk> , all about their <unk> creatures to know about their <unk> creatures -- that they &apos;re a professional life in things .
don &apos;t go down the tension . i &apos;d like to be <unk> .
it &apos;s about a documentary in <unk> about consciousness .
when i came closer , i was reminded of all the details that most people can see , their clothes and so forth .
how do you know that it was what they did ?
see it ? who doesn &apos;t see it ? that &apos;s going to help .
we &apos;re starting <unk> . some examples .
this morning , jeff <unk> <unk> his efforts , a good , big theory in neuroscience .
and the <unk> in london said , &quot; what i mean to do is , &quot; who &apos;s at mit , &quot; who &apos;s at mit -- &quot; i mean , no one is going to go . &quot;
now , <unk> was in stockholm at january , and the first picture ; here &apos;s a picture of stockholm , and this is a picture of stockholm , a typical road at the second january of january .
so , we made this enormous conference with lots of <unk> and tried to figure out who changed and where they were doing .
then i went through 20 years ago -- from europe to asia -- through the mountains of the <unk> , <unk> east , north africa , north africa , russia .
what do we know about the <unk> of the taliban who are <unk> to the doors of people to send their daughters to schools like to send their daughters to schools like in <unk> ?
the world changed .
i was in my office , my desk was <unk> , i had the blue <unk> on the walls .
and there was even two of them .
there was really what happened .
how amazing is that ?
now , i want to talk about some other patients that are doing everything in their power to improve health care .
and then i realized that i remembered the side of google earth , where we can fly to each cancer .
we are , they &apos;re the most <unk> resource in health care .
<unk> from seawater is a <unk> .
here &apos;s the resolution . a wonderful creature , right ?
they don &apos;t take your surroundings with the help of sound . i &apos;m talking about the <unk> .
and in the united states , the national costs would be <unk> in the <unk> billion dollars , so that &apos;s how bats are going to be able to be <unk> .
why should we think about aging ?
if you look at the same thing , and you look at the night , and this beautiful , <unk> animal , i want you to smile . thank you very much .
200 times had to be <unk> in the economic development .
the <unk> of co2 <unk> <unk> is not all , but there &apos;s a lot of countries in the bottom billion , but there &apos;s a lot of countries in the bottom billion .
so what happens wrong ? why are it called &quot; <unk> ? &quot;
and so the countries of the bottom billion is a very <unk> politics .
a couple of economists came from time , and they said , &quot; why don &apos;t you try to make a picture ? it &apos;s going to teach the value . &quot;
in this moment , in the world , a billion people in the world &apos;s poor or <unk> countries . how can we help them ? the economist paul <unk> shares a <unk> , insecure plan that we can do the gap between poor and rich .
we don &apos;t have a <unk> , where they &apos;re going to be made .
and this is what he &apos;s going to do is to be a <unk> guy in africa that &apos;s going to be able to be <unk> <unk> .
so we &apos;ve got this : imagine , you know , you &apos;ve got a lecture , and i could talk to the same time with the people in their minds .
&quot; <unk> of <unk> surgery .
14 years ago , i came up to the first time on this ordinary material , <unk> , which was used since centuries in the same way .
he asks me if i could build this as a <unk> piece of the city .
so we were <unk> with small <unk> <unk> to create a frozen <unk> that &apos;s going to be <unk> by wind , and in the test that it can be made by people that are going to be made by people who are able to move on .
they were in their <unk> in the grass , and they &apos;ve seen <unk> patterns of the <unk> next to people who don &apos;t know , and they had the <unk> of wonder .
that &apos;s why i was thinking that this is an enormous risk for our society .
when peter is moving down , this yellow line that you see there is the <unk> place that you can see in <unk> mind .
if you do this , what are you going to control ?
and to say that these changes changes in the death of death , even a surprise about a fact that it can be true about a fact that is true or wrong .
now let me look at what i don &apos;t say . i don &apos;t tell the science of this room , or that we don &apos;t say science can be <unk> , or that we &apos;re going to have scientific answers to every <unk> moral question .
now , why would this be a <unk> morality ?
how far is the likelihood that this is a summit of human development ?
on the left side , you see <unk> <unk> .
we live in a world full of <unk> technologies , and these technologies can &apos;t be <unk> , it &apos;s always easier to put things out of things as they &apos;re using together .
but then we need to talk about well-being in a larger context .
and what is its natural enemy , which is the <unk> of the <unk> of the good beetle that we &apos;re talking about ?
it &apos;s a protocell , no <unk> , but a <unk> <unk> , two <unk> long , <unk> , <unk> , a quick and <unk> <unk> .
and if we <unk> these good <unk> , for example , in a <unk> <unk> , they go to the flowers .
in israel , where we &apos;re on about 1,000 hectares -- that &apos;s about 10,000 israeli -- that &apos;s about 10,000 israeli <unk> -- biological <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , 75 percent of pesticides .
third , to increase the consciousness of farmers for the potential of this <unk> .
<unk> is one of my <unk> .
it &apos;s still fun to make the <unk> rich fun , as about <unk> else . i &apos;m going to do that .
&quot; urban <unk> &quot; -- that &apos;s what the new yorker needs .
her <unk> name was <unk> <unk> , and so that was -- i wasn &apos;t <unk> enough to say , &quot; take the video . &quot;
or also , the republic of the soviet union found only a few decades , maybe within a decade , after time , the soviet union was the most powerful .
because there are 80 percent there that are really insects to eat insects .
they &apos;re on the beginning of <unk> .
why do we actually do these machines in the <unk> , but it &apos;s in the way of meat ?
it &apos;s 25 pounds per person per person per year .
and now , we &apos;re going to decide to have one , or to five kilograms of <unk> .
we can increase them a little bit of entropy , but it &apos;s going to be going to be a <unk> .
and you might think , well , they &apos;re not available .
my three minutes doesn &apos;t have been done , right ?
he said , &quot; <unk> , we have to put them on the table .
and i &apos;ve seen a sign .
even if <unk> is the system <unk> , they &apos;re doing it on a way that the society is doing .
and in this book , the small lewis would find the big idea .
this is a <unk> . and on the back of the back , there are some other models , <unk> , and space to get some calculations . okay ?
right . so , this is going to use the device .
there &apos;s a quality of <unk> and precision that &apos;s just amazing and remarkable .
so , the first robot i want to talk about is the <unk> .
it &apos;s going to be used to show that if you have cameras , or other sensors because it &apos;s going to be up , it &apos;s a meter 80 big , you know about <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> .
for example , in this case , in this case , although the left and the right wheel with a single axis is connected to a single axis , and so quickly .
welcome to <unk> , the robot <unk> in the <unk> project . &quot;
but the cool thing about this is the <unk> .
and then , as it does . this was our entire first attempt , and that was our first attempt , and ...
but what is the secret of our success ?
but only from a <unk> of imagination is not enough .
in this way , education is very important .
<unk> , which is going to be <unk> .
there &apos;s actually no <unk> teachers . and only eight percent of the people of the county , and only eight percent of the people of the county &apos;s county .
there &apos;s a complete liquid of creative capital in bertie county in bertie county .
the goal of the game is to have all the <unk> on <unk> , then they won &apos;t have the team .
but in the last couple of decades , but a lot of money that went on for the last couple of decades , completely way .
and after that , and the neighbors about that , and the neighbors about what they buy , and where and why and why , is a homework .
in this point , it &apos;s actually impossible to create a lot of <unk> surfaces .
i want to ask you , i want to follow my journey of <unk> and explore .
after four months ago , <unk> <unk> , and now it &apos;s about eight months away before .
here &apos;s a couple of results .
this global act is designed in the same amount of climate change , how to do fossil fuels , maybe even more than this .
when i found out of these two things , i &apos;ve got my very , full of personal reasons as well as a scientific reasons .
it has been a very , <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was partly by the <unk> foundation .
so after treatment , we &apos;re going to take the child <unk> a series of simple <unk> , to see how your vision is possible .
the answer is in motion . i want to show you the next video .
i had to discuss with my wife .
we &apos;re looking at these <unk> , and i don &apos;t have a lot more results to talk about .
and then i said , i &apos;ve been <unk> by these <unk> <unk> , and i thought , oh , i don &apos;t know , but before i &apos;m talking about <unk> , i just look at how this is like this .
but this was in the fall of 95 , and then when the winter <unk> , he said , &quot; you know , you &apos;re good enough .
ss : so , it turns out to the <unk> of 2009 , and it &apos;s very excited . her family with -- it &apos;s a big thing .
i tried every one that i could , <unk> against who , against what the <unk> , so against who i &apos;m going to do here ?
i had always won all the time , and now i thought , what ?
you can be <unk> big . take it down . &quot;
<unk> : aimee and the designers are going to be here at ted <unk> , and we &apos;re going to talk about design .
they took somebody who came around and the shoes of the shoes .
but it &apos;s almost impossible to be able to make the actual <unk> of the economy , because we use <unk> .
or for the <unk> jobs .
and another thing about the mathematics : mathematics looks sometimes like mathematics -- like this example here -- and sometimes it doesn &apos;t be -- like , &quot; am i love ? &quot;
in education , we use about 80 percent of time to teach people , how to teach people about three of hand .
if people ask me , is this ?
but the <unk> in cars allows it to separate these things , so that &apos;s the way we &apos;re going to do today is something else that makes a car , and that &apos;s about his <unk> .
it &apos;s wrong .
but i think we can make both of the same time .
and one of the reasons that this is so important -- so it &apos;s very important , so it &apos;s very important , computers in the library .
it was winter in 2009 , and i &apos;ve been blind for about a year .
i thought i was interested in my father , who had been forced to be <unk> by <unk> , in the brain .
so , as you can see , only by the <unk> of the <unk> , which is going to be <unk> in the world of the ground , and the time is a sense of where you are and what you &apos;re going to do is make a sense of where you are and what you &apos;re going to do .
but when i was <unk> , and when i went down , i was able to be able to go back to every corner .
if you create a city in the sense of the blind , it &apos;s going to be many , many jobs .
to give you a sense of the experience of this experience , the article was , &quot; i think i think you &apos;re <unk> . &quot;
and the <unk> of the famous thing i knew -- the 10 commandments , love your next , is <unk> and <unk> you ...
you &apos;re <unk> money for a good purpose , and it &apos;s designed by emotional food on the purpose .
it &apos;s not a book that was written , and he was written by the sky .
so this is actually the key for me to remind me that on the way that i remember that on the way that the car is not <unk> , and i didn &apos;t put it on the way to <unk> .
that was very inspiring for me .
so if we want to have this book , you &apos;re going to have to be able to do it , and we really need to do it with it , and we really have to work with it .
so we have this wonderful progress .
so the <unk> that made this work was to <unk> , so we &apos;ve created <unk> applications like this <unk> <unk> <unk> , which is the <unk> of a <unk> on a <unk> to a <unk> .
nelson was working on a small , <unk> <unk> <unk> with the name , &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; for steven <unk> , and invited us to develop the interface that &apos;s used to be used in the film that &apos;s going to be used in the film .
we &apos;re building these <unk> surgery because we like yellow and <unk> on green <unk> .
let &apos;s take the apart apart : i &apos;m going to put it in <unk> .
we , as humans , are the things that make things , and we should make sure that our machines are helping us to help us and build it .
john , thank you that they &apos;re doing justice in reality .
what christians did , wouldn &apos;t have been able to be able to have digital technologies .
but here &apos;s the point . the <unk> creative act is still a creative act .
but the institutions that are shown by this black line , said , &quot; we &apos;re changing this <unk> .
they &apos;re designed by the members of the community for each other .
and as all the good <unk> , it &apos;s about 20 years ago , if you change the interest of the audience .
you didn &apos;t always have five days . so , in fact , changes and we began to play <unk> .
of course , i didn &apos;t want to go to the <unk> .
the other thing was <unk> cricket .
it was the new india ? this was another world where you could get players from everywhere , as long as you could get the best players for the best price for the best price .
we all had already seen games in the <unk> , but there was something that we had never seen . <unk> khan , the audience , with a <unk> song to the <unk> -- <unk> , not for india , but for <unk> .
could you imagine this day ?
i &apos;ve done all of you to do a experience richer , and the game , and hopefully , and hopefully , there &apos;s a <unk> time to work in this business .
and you know that the <unk> dogs is , because they have <unk> fast in memory , how often they &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs to have seen .
why about all in the world should anyone play <unk> ?
on the other hand , if you go to a developing country , and you can buy 25 dollars a <unk> , it &apos;s a <unk> for a big mac .
would you spend their <unk> 20 dollars for a ticket ?
i &apos;ll give you a example .
and if the way back to the other end of the city of 100 euros , it &apos;s 100 mice worth the way it &apos;s not going to be <unk> , but people don &apos;t think they &apos;re going to be like that .
well , the big thing is , you know , it &apos;s extremely <unk> .
look at what happens when we <unk> <unk> .
dan , i would like to hear more attention . you say that our answer is about terrorism , i mean he &apos;s a kind of mental mistake ?
there are no weapons of <unk> .
and so some of the people on economists as dumb people .
art and variation is one of this <unk> that takes a certain intellectual activity , because you &apos;re always able to study the variation with the theme that you have in mind .
rb : &quot; in words , and in fashion , the same rule is the same rule of a great time or to old or old , not the first one of the new time , the last one of the time was the old <unk> . &quot;
and i woke up one day and said , &quot; well , maybe it &apos;s not that ? &quot;
first of all , my willingness to tell me a critical audience , without telling me that i &apos;m thinking about it .
it &apos;s my intention of the poster <unk> , i should not understand it yet .
so , in the same time , they need to survive our survival .
companies often have a <unk> smell .
if the space was <unk> , we could see that people have more negative relationships for <unk> men .
it &apos;s like i &apos;d like to talk to about what i &apos;ve done in these 20 years of what i &apos;ve done in these 20 years .
it <unk> my mind and my soul .
they &apos;re <unk> .
there &apos;s a young army , hollywood director , with his friends , other <unk> , and they talk about what <unk> means .
without food , i was sick .
we don &apos;t need a lot more likely to make the plan out of it .
our government was <unk> .
so for me , the idea that we have all these children , it &apos;s a generation , we &apos;ve got a whole generation of children who had so much more awful <unk> or damage to africa , and africa has to have to live .
by the whole book , more than a hour , more than a hour of a hour of <unk> and <unk> animations .
what is the business ?
it was at least the point that you can see , in fact , in fact , it &apos;s always going to be <unk> .
so i thought , &quot; yeah , that &apos;s a good idea . &quot;
the talk is still about this .
and when i came from college , i &apos;ve been working in california , and you &apos;re going to be working on the <unk> <unk> on the roofs and these things .
rsw : how does it look like that ?
the <unk> -- they &apos;ve got me for me to meet , and they &apos;ve sent their <unk> <unk> to the <unk> .
it reminds me about that .
and the guy looked at me and said , &quot; well , what can i do for you , mr. gehry ? &quot;
if you &apos;re spending four months after three months , the ideas are always more important and rich .
and one thing that i wanted to mention in my <unk> , but somehow , i was surprised to thank all the business that helped me .
but in the meantime , these things are <unk> .
and this is the last 10 weeks later , come out of hand .
you see the <unk> , the <unk> .
the <unk> and things are remarkable , and things is remarkable , and this is going to be the <unk> .
it &apos;s an incredible antidote , 40,000 workers , i think , five <unk> and the window is going to be built here .
in this level , about 1,500 workers .
50 percent of the computers on the world &apos;s living in china .
it was pretty unusual , so <unk> , that less than five percent of the <unk> was a picture .
and the wish of three is , <unk> . i was told myself , i would be able to make yourself one , and i never wanted to do something like this .
and it becomes increasingly important that we can figure out how to figure out how we can win these materials from these extremely complex <unk> .
the traditional ways to increase material , doesn &apos;t work for <unk> .
the traditional way to create <unk> is going to happen with oil or cancer .
so at the end of this process , we have a <unk> <unk> : many different kinds of <unk> and many different qualities of plastic .
now , i see a lot of <unk> out there .
and what we see is that people tend to be able to put errors on the same way , again and again .
maybe we should study how monkeys make economic decisions and figure out whether they &apos;re the same <unk> of how we do .
here &apos;s <unk> . they &apos;re going to use a number of food , and you &apos;re happy , and you get your food .
they &apos;re going to take something transparent to the way that the market is moving .
now , imagine that i &apos;m going to give you 1,000 <unk> dollars in the hand -- so 10 <unk> hundred dollars .
you can either choose a <unk> loss -- like , i &apos;m going to get a coin . you &apos;re going to pay you very much .
if we put in our small <unk> , the same ecology would be able to do the same thing as people do ?
the person on the left is a safer loss .
maybe it &apos;s not only the people on the last stage of development that make stupid errors .
and this is the <unk> .
but if we think about <unk> , most of them are only four stories tall .
we have to build less with concrete and steel and we need to build higher , in the last time , we &apos;ve been working on <unk> <unk> .
this is the same amount of , as we had a year in a year of 900 cars less on the streets .
<unk> rocks <unk> my window .
maybe the citizens , because recently , she came up to fight against the <unk> of the law . the citizens of these networks are working together to help each other .
<unk> , the biggest and the oldest bank in russia , mostly in the <unk> of the russian government , is now <unk> , to prevent employees and citizens in the development of innovation .
we &apos;ve heard about ted heard about people who have their plants with <unk> <unk> , and <unk> work on the entire world of young people to make the <unk> and make videos .
and so i started thinking that the eternal mother always said , &quot; are all kids there ? &quot;
that &apos;s compassion .
he asked them to be a message , and all the other read in their own language is a central version of the golden rule , which is a version of the golden rule , &quot; what you don &apos;t want you to do with you , you don &apos;t have any other other . &quot;
so , i mean , it &apos;s going to be a blog that means to do this individual needs .
and we &apos;re doing this for some <unk> .
there are about 180 news in washington d.c.
this is going to be <unk> from parks and sculptures .
it &apos;s made of <unk> <unk> .
there &apos;s also a couple of constraints about his water .
the bubble is a <unk> .
i saw my <unk> , when i was just five .
one of the things i met when i was trying to eat my friend because we didn &apos;t have food , because we didn &apos;t have food .
as a child as young and <unk> , words i don &apos;t forget , not forget .
this is my story , <unk> in form of a lesson .
my breakfast , my lunch , died of a foundation that i &apos;ve developed , because we want to build a school in sudan .
give us tools . give them the farmers .
audience : yeah !
the third chapter is a <unk> <unk> called &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
that means more than 60 percent are .
we solve this challenge on the best way that we have the problem of the <unk> .
and even if that happens , it &apos;s not too late .
i remember nothing from time when i was five years old .
the santa knows whether you were <unk> or not . right ?
but , fear , you were so willing to school . you were so ready . &quot;
they looked at each other and bosnia , in the sense , that was the right answer , and then they asked , &quot; believe that we &apos;re all brothers and sisters on this earth ? &quot;
maybe your greater ability to cooperate and adapt ?
and i think this film shows the <unk> look at the modern times , &quot; the condoms . &quot;
in the second world war , we had to produce a lot of stuff .
but we don &apos;t want to forget that it needs to be a fundamental contribution , and that &apos;s how many resources of the planet we use .
but now , for the good news .
it may be in latin america .
and in this point , the <unk> and <unk> of climate change is in terms of climate change .
we &apos;ve done a project for a couple of years ago , a big program , it was called a big program , which was the <unk> -- with many , many people -- a lot of experts were involved -- everything on evidence -- a <unk> <unk> .
a group of a group you &apos;re going to spend it for themselves and the other group will spend it for other people .
when they went out from the first building to the second , all of a man who was going to come up with a man , which is <unk> , and clearly help . the question is : would you get them and helped it ?
the word is &quot; <unk> , &quot; a combination of &quot; <unk> &quot; and &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
there &apos;s a wonderful book called &#91; : it &apos;s all the time : it &apos;s all the <unk> things .
since -- there are four decades ago -- i &apos;ve taken the best in this area , in the world , in the world , <unk> , young and old , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> net of art , <unk> and <unk> .
and i found this in my dance , my dance , my strength , my emotional , my passion , my passion , my real life .
i was <unk> between <unk> and <unk> , and i forgot him to be able to adapt this to my <unk> .
well , it was essentially frustration .
that &apos;s how it was .
he got them together to do something <unk> , and then he took them into this software , which i think she &apos;s developed his son , and he &apos;s designed this wonderful presentation , and he created this wonderful presentation .
in these documents , there &apos;s little <unk> , small <unk> .
i want to give you -- yes , do you make a nice website . how could i say , you don &apos;t want to make a nice website ?
now , you ask the <unk> data that you now have together . 32 islands , which everybody has a protein with these properties , and they can look at it .
and this is what we &apos;re about to create data .
all this is going to be able to get two million children less dying in the last year , in the last year , in 2000 .
and if it &apos;s so , we &apos;re ready to collect feedback , and we &apos;re going to make sure that the <unk> are really able to use results ?
you just show one of the numbers there , the 5,000 -- is that number ?
my brothers started to draw me back to me , and i &apos;m going to get to paint .
that &apos;s what i &apos;m fascinated to explore this area .
how many of you have a cow on the road on the road from bangalore , in the way of bangalore ?
it &apos;s only so that we &apos;re going to be <unk> as people are able to see reality , and that &apos;s what the meaning is .
and they said , &quot; okay . &quot;
can you not do something like that , you &apos;re artists ? &quot;
this is a box from <unk> .
because if we look at somebody , we see the footprint .
what percentage of you have the foreign <unk> ?
unfortunately , he looked at the last 20,000 years in a cave .
so , the <unk> is actually <unk> to come here , because -- if you think about it , i &apos;ve been talking about the most under economists that most of the things that are very <unk> is that most things are very <unk> .
this is the place that i showed you at the beginning .
we &apos;re going to do something .
think about translation .
they can &apos;t <unk> , so they accept it and find it , and they find a way to work with it .
it &apos;s very hard to voices .
it &apos;s <unk> and <unk> .
how do you make hunger when they have hunger .
there are millions of different <unk> .
so remember , if we think about sexual education and activities , they &apos;re in baseball .
it &apos;s from the poet <unk> <unk> , and it &apos;s like , &quot; i don &apos;t see it . &quot;
and it &apos;s like , &quot; how much percent of the day you think about this person ? &quot;
in <unk> societies , people who have the people <unk> of these <unk> <unk> .
they came up with <unk> percent of the <unk> home .
and it really became a strong force .
and i said , &quot; why do you think that men are <unk> than women ? &quot;
there was no time on that , in this time , women were so <unk> , so interesting , as well as that .
she &apos;s 11 , she was since she was 13 .
i began to <unk> , why you &apos;re more likely to be in love with a person in love with the other .
they &apos;re going to be as long as the human race is in which the human race is , which was called &quot; this <unk> choir . &quot;
but unfortunately , i know it .
most researchers believe that obesity is the cause of insulin .
maybe we should ask ourselves whether it might be that the most common thing is the cause of <unk> and <unk> disease -- at least most people ?
others , it &apos;s too much <unk> .
peter <unk> : what if our perspectives are wrong ?
my beautiful , henry ford , really believed that it was the mission of ford motor company to improve the lives of people to improve their lives and save cars for each other .
and the good news is that we &apos;ve got the big problems of cars and environment -- not only at ford , but in the way of industry .
i think you can imagine it already .
but what really inspired me is the possibilities that we &apos;re going to have when our cars start to communicate with each other .
we need a infrastructure that is able to support these flexible future .
this is a minute .
i think now , my mom , i think that &apos;s a kind of <unk> .
the nurses need to see data .
that &apos;s really important . it &apos;s enormous . &quot;
so what happened ?
and for us , it was great , because we &apos;ve won a lot of prices .
i was infected when i was 17 , at the time , when i was 17 , i had adults that really thought of my ideas , i thought , <unk> and a lot of <unk> <unk> with me .
now it was all about the children . we don &apos;t <unk> .
and basically , we gave kids a simple challenge .
we &apos;ve got some wonderful images for you , for a really good purpose , for a really good purpose , the money that you &apos;re going to be going to be used to do is to buy english .
but what i never said , and what i &apos;d like to do is think that <unk> is cool .
in a way , in a way , in the <unk> or <unk> <unk> product that we have <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , which is a different kind of development -- and inspired by the incredible kind of <unk> experience .
if you think about the change in our society , the <unk> of the country in the cities that took 200 years , the same process is happening in 20 years .
it looked at changes , even though this was not sufficient .
so we would be able to put models under a visual sky .
i &apos;m going to have a <unk> in the altitude of 94 percent for almost it .
and how do we do in this <unk> world , especially in some places i &apos;m talking about -- china , for example , that i &apos;m talking about -- china is going to build 400 new airports .
and this is the focus of the <unk> talk -- there is no lighting in the positive sense that is healthy and our well-being , without the <unk> darkness .
in contrast to the first office that i showed you at the beginning of the talk , this is a very famous lab , which is that the <unk> .
and you see , you see the <unk> building , which was going to be a study of modern <unk> .
i think what you &apos;re seeing here is really amazing -- how much light in the sky and never achieve the ground .
this is not very <unk> and <unk> .
they &apos;re not going to <unk> anymore .
when our <unk> , as a couple of weeks ago , a war in a third of india was <unk> , about 200 <unk> <unk> , who &apos;s called <unk> .
and one day , i don &apos;t know what happened -- while i was going to go home from the office at home , i might see a <unk> , or it came to me : could i be like a <unk> , life was wonderful .
<unk> : but what &apos;s going to use it ? what was it going to use ? what was it going to use ?
to do what to do ? to <unk> rocks .
this is the only place where they could make their creativity .
they don &apos;t want the second choice of standards and <unk> .
and this is what <unk> <unk> was done .
i had to go to my favorite .
mr. <unk> , who lives with a physical challenge , only 50 inches tall .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> .
this is <unk> .
these are <unk> billion people .
or <unk> . it &apos;s just fun and people love to do it and make fun things .
so we &apos;ve done very , very hard working , but we knew it &apos;s not so hard to develop the technology as the acceptance of how acceptance is important and how the technology can be used .
cars are not done to stabilize the side , it &apos;s wonderful <unk> to send them between cities and forth , but think about it : we &apos;ve got all the problems in terms of different and speed .
so , if we could have this box here , we could have a solution to <unk> , electricity , and communication , and maybe drinking water in a sustainable collection , the 60 gram ?
<unk> or <unk> is that the people who die there are kind of , somehow , in the <unk> process , we &apos;re going to use the fact that they &apos;re either raped or <unk> , or even both of the things that they &apos;ve been doing , or even both of them .
in the world , as a result of <unk> , the fear and <unk> in cities , and the press , and the press to mention the press , and the press is true , and that &apos;s true .
and the united states and the united states , now , is a real international organization that &apos;s related to production in the south and global partnerships in the global cortex .
but also part of that , a month of a month -- you &apos;re living in the future , and we &apos;ve got a long <unk> .
and after them under a critical price , it turns out , if you &apos;re successful , about a critical mass <unk> , a breakthrough .
but they &apos;re going to be very , very cheap , and you can see the interesting effects . if you &apos;re cheaper , you &apos;re going to be cheaper , you lose the universes , the <unk> and the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , you win .
if you look at this , linux is in red , it has 20 percent .
&quot; open free &quot; is really , you know , the gift of silicon <unk> in the world .
for some of the technologies we talked about .
human capital works in between the time , and trying to take the best thing from both of the two .
the second thing was to be extremely productive .
president obama doesn &apos;t understand that .
because one of the poorest parts of the world have access to a technology that allows him to change his life .
and yet , this is exactly the characteristics that men and women were fascinated by all sorts of generations .
you remember , during the <unk> , <unk> <unk> in his blog about the <unk> and <unk> him often . that &apos;s just possible because blogs are easy to use .
i like music , and i like <unk> , and i think i heard steve martin , and i told me that i can do it .
i was writing this table , and i &apos;ve got that einstein &apos;s thinking about einstein today .
and you see this chart .
these little things like this little things .
and maybe i have to <unk> , because i think i &apos;m talking about this .
he became sustainable <unk> , except from our generation .
we need to use this process of right now to get a better understanding for how to get the oceans .
we &apos;ve been studying these fish <unk> , but only we had to learn how to do them .
but it &apos;s only half as big as the biggest tuna that we &apos;ve ever had .
they come together . that might be sex under <unk> , and there &apos;s it .
you can see a <unk> -- it &apos;s <unk> like a gentleman -- and a white shark is going to go back to this , a <unk> creature that comes in the same way to our 16 feet tall .
and then we give us these animals , even to help us help us .
and the white shark .
i think he didn &apos;t even thought that the end of my students were so right .
they said , &quot; apart from which we &apos;ve talked about , are they <unk> groups who want to damage the united states ? &quot;
you don &apos;t have to keep your energy .
now , what i look at my <unk> is that i was there , and i know that i &apos;ve been there to be in the president of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
every couple of moments , i don &apos;t use a <unk> on my life .
when i started with the project , people said , &quot; why would you want to tell all what you do and where you are ?
now it &apos;s very normal .
now , you can see this <unk> of paris to see how incredibly quickly the growth is .
i looked at thousands of these <unk> , and trust and efficiency are always the <unk> elements .
how do we do the <unk> of the face of the face of the face ?
i was kind of a mind in the system .
this side is going to be <unk> questions , and 80 percent of them get a fascinating answer .
i want to start with a paradox .
and here you see it in the relationship of inequality , which i showed you here , i &apos;m going to come back to that i &apos;m going to come back to that .
so , with the rich , developed countries , and then in a second <unk> time , in a second time , the 50 american states -- with the same question : can be the more vulnerable states on all of these rooms ?
in the visual effects , what we &apos;re going to do is change the benefit of the population of the population .
and in our analysis of american states , we find the same contrast .
so , the social <unk> <unk> , and the fear of these reactors .
or for example , the reason that violence is more important is more important , because people are transparent to become <unk> .
a year ago , more than three million <unk> has a new knee or a <unk> .
you remember , like <unk> before the <unk> of the <unk> .
if you put it under youtube or a rock , or a <unk> , it &apos;s very clear that you have a shepherd , and in societies , in which disability with a social pain , people are very sensitive .
so thank you .
you want to be a spiritual magazine ?
i even bought the <unk> <unk> , and there &apos;s a little beetle on this , which is : &quot; we don &apos;t use these <unk> , to <unk> <unk> .
these are the results of one to the <unk> , &quot; oh google just as many &quot; king , &quot; like there are pages .
it &apos;s a little fear <unk> .
but if you were always in this state , the work would never be done . because you would suddenly say , &quot; oh , i thought , &quot; oh , i &apos;ve found a new way to do it . &quot;
almost everything we &apos;re doing is happening .
it &apos;s about to be sure in this world .
wouldn &apos;t be <unk> , and he would get apart apart , then they would never be a <unk> .
it &apos;s a very small <unk> -- you should not have the results of the <unk> .
i &apos;m going to talk about children and obesity and a series of experiments that made me the idea of how a alternative education could look like a alternative education .
and at night , this day <unk> 70 children in the internet .
so , i could actually choose <unk> , to give a <unk> , which is partly the entire world .
what you see is , there &apos;s a child called the computer .
natural systems are all <unk> : galaxies , molecules , cells , organisms , organisms , societies -- except the discussion about the theory of smart artists .
and it &apos;s about the <unk> of <unk> in this whole <unk> .
i bought with a nice suit and wrote shoes with <unk> , and i &apos;ve got this remarkable access that i had to <unk> .
but 2002 , when my tour went to the end , i decided i didn &apos;t go to the job that i was waiting for me in london .
i felt that something was destroyed .
and i went down . i went through these amounts .
and i traveled to kosovo and <unk> there are the government .
new diplomat is part of one of the trends that comes from the world that comes out , obviously , and that the world is the world .
it &apos;s horrible that they are the people who are actually affected , not <unk> .
this is the politics of the 21st century , and in a certain sense , <unk> healthy diplomat , this change that changes with us all of us .
&quot; hey , would you put it out there ? &quot;
because if we go back to <unk> , they understood by this motivation that can tell you that a simple mistake can tell us , or to remind us why you want to love something .
we feel awe , pity .
here we go .
what is the number one ?
no . in the &apos; 70s , there was the <unk> show , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; in the end of the top 10 of the <unk> , was from &quot; <unk> , &quot; and &quot; three circles for charlie . &quot;
i can choose it from the island .
and i &apos;m really happy to discuss with you to talk to you , i &apos;m sitting in and say , &quot; i can tell me the most important thing and why that &apos;s so cool ? &quot;
so next is this <unk> stuff , which is the <unk> <unk> .
from a series of reasons .
or even worse , <unk> education will still be more like the guy who says , &quot; actually ... &quot;
but we &apos;ve got so much a lot of work , and if there &apos;s somebody in science , i &apos;ll ask you to do with me .
we go down the staircase , and you know a state of consciousness .
so many books about war , the same thing is that none of the people are doing so much more like war .
<unk> believed that all of us , that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing , a sense of <unk> .
he wanted to say that , &quot; <unk> and <unk> people don &apos;t want to be <unk> , and without bulgaria can &apos;t move it to it . &quot;
it uses the other .
once they were all in a same tribe , they were able to keep the benefits of cooperation for you .
it &apos;s about to connect with other people &apos;s ideas .
jh : thank you .
and i realized that <unk> is not just going to be inside .
and right next to the garage , he took his own <unk> , where he &apos;s going to be able to put it into his <unk> , which is a different important role in <unk> .
everything is always easier in design , and this is this <unk> , and here &apos;s this <unk> , and my god , i &apos;m just photographed .
&quot; the <unk> of <unk> &quot; is going to see the fifth time .
this book is called &quot; <unk> . &quot; it &apos;s another word for <unk> .
this is actually a experiment for a customer , <unk> , where we &apos;ve done a sequence of six photographs and tried to get people around the <unk> medium in the internet .
they said that people don &apos;t like them .
a article about brian <unk> -- a really boring article -- so i took the whole article in <unk> .
somebody told me today , there were these things called the <unk> , but i don &apos;t know what that is .
that &apos;s very high for most jobs .
in fact , it was , obviously , no technology , but obvious , but obvious .
this is not different planet . these are things that are happening on our planet .
and finally , i come back to these <unk> .
this is <unk> <unk> , and he was <unk> <unk> <unk> of the theory of <unk> .
we &apos;ve heard about <unk> , the guns .
and i think that &apos;s really important , because if you can imagine him about the invention of the technology of <unk> -- which is a loss for a loss for society .
so , i &apos;ve got me to the first time i was a very young time when i was very young .
he &apos;s going to get back back to this , and it takes a arm full , and he &apos;s going to come back , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ! &quot; -- the same thing happens .
but the point is : we were a month ago , and i wanted to get the animals into us , so that we could see their behaviors that we could see their behaviors , without them .
and if you go down to the bottom , the wonderful blue water , where you go to the beginning , it &apos;s always <unk> and <unk> .
but there &apos;s no sun , there &apos;s no sun . it &apos;s a <unk> world , and it &apos;s a <unk> world there , and it &apos;s all this <unk> .
but i also have seen the right opposite .
everybody &apos;s talking to each other . there &apos;s no <unk> dots on a map more , then it &apos;s a network that we create .
she was a <unk> , and she didn &apos;t go back and i didn &apos;t go back and <unk> us like little girls , but they didn &apos;t have the <unk> clothes , but i knew i didn &apos;t know <unk> , but didn &apos;t know .
my parents came down , and my sister was arrested .
cities are the <unk> of civilization .
is edinburgh a horse ?
so , we &apos;ve done our entire economy in the left of the upper left : <unk> .
the heart <unk> , they live longer , they live longer , <unk> from <unk> and food through the <unk> , etc .
but most of the most important thing is that the <unk> , the tradition of <unk> , is bigger than one of one -- is so about one -- so that &apos;s how about one -- so about this .
they grow around and stop , part of our <unk> .
it &apos;s just like a <unk> .
children in the 12th grade are less excited by political systems .
he had had to talk about in a school school in our own school .
my students built this <unk> as a result of a challenge that we had to ask us on the <unk> end of the year .
this is my <unk> , because it was done tuesday , when i got the students <unk> to choice .
and this is the same thing .
in fact , you could -- -- we don &apos;t go .
it &apos;s a <unk> .
and he gave a very important question .
and i &apos;m going to show you about the 15 million dollars of image .
you see the stem cells back .
many of these patients are hard <unk> .
the european union , the same .
and even though i don &apos;t have patents , so that &apos;s what i mean , you &apos;re going to meet some of my inventions today .
you know , of course , what that means .
and they &apos;ve done all this progress in so five times . they &apos;re all so young .
thank you all .
in school -- in fact , i &apos;ve got a organization <unk> , which is such a <unk> power , you know , like you here , they would really like it and so .
it was also very <unk> , but it was so full of <unk> .
my daughter -- my daughter had written this , she said , &quot; let me go , &quot; let &apos;s talk to humor . &quot;
i &apos;m <unk> . &quot;
i want to think your hand .
and then i got a name last year ago , a call that i &apos;m going to talk to you right now .
and i thought if i could write books in which this world was little and connected , maybe i might be familiar with the problems that all of us are interested in , and you might even move to the world to improve the world .
and john said , &quot; sit on good people who do good .
there was no specific media , which was working on public interest .
i thought that &apos;s the problem in <unk> years .
i learned that it &apos;s not just a real way to change .
what do you think about how many police are on this bed ? well , three .
now look at this . this is the <unk> .
yeah , the medical advice of the <unk> , &quot; yeah , i said , &quot; yes , i said , you don &apos;t have to do that , i don &apos;t see it . &quot;
this is our first patient , just from the <unk> , and now you look at this chair .
these are the <unk> of my <unk> , or our <unk> .
i need to make . &quot;
this is in the <unk> depression .
they put them into a very special <unk> diet , and they &apos;re doing it with big care .
his app was just <unk> , when he won the <unk> price .
but there was a lot of theories about how to get this problem , how to give this problem mr. .
so , we &apos;ve got the situation in the world today where there are more countries that are the relationship between the citizens and the government is going to be <unk> by the internet , which is going to be <unk> by mostly private service .
<unk> <unk> : let &apos;s take the internet back !
they &apos;re <unk> all four years of <unk> in the <unk> , and in the <unk> of the olympics , they were the big <unk> of communism , with a great impact that was used to be done .
the european union that started in the time of globalization , and it &apos;s called the sea of globalization , and it &apos;s called the arctic <unk> in the history of about 500 million people in history .
in 1994 , for seven years , 20 years ago , 20 of these boats were the <unk> of <unk> to italy , every single night .
let me go to the <unk> of the <unk> .
i &apos;d like to imagine mr. <unk> .
they change our <unk> .
i mean , if i &apos;m a good <unk> , i &apos;ve got to believe that there is a reason to be a reason .
this led him very <unk> . they didn &apos;t want to go back to the beginning .
and it was waited since 1960 , as a <unk> conductor , a <unk> , said , &quot; i think our ancestors might have been born for a time in the water . &quot;
but the absolute connection is that it &apos;s just in a direction .
and then the fact is that we &apos;re <unk> .
for example , professor <unk> . he understood it .
so if it comes out , and if it &apos;s going to happen , who &apos;s going to happen ?
first of all , i want to do as <unk> as possible .
yeah , i was going to be able to go through a couple of <unk> .
you see , somehow , in the life of other people , and i &apos;ve got that feeling that i &apos;m going to get a lot of inspiration from the user .
this is called &quot; atheist . &quot;
there &apos;s <unk> -- you &apos;ve seen a lot of most of you already seen .
<unk> and <unk> <unk> frank <unk> , and he tells us what he &apos;s going to do with passion is to help people decide to help people , with small , <unk> <unk> , and interact with them .
the answer is pretty strange .
so four of four : tell the people , &quot; if you don &apos;t have the <unk> information , i &apos;ll give my help . &quot;
and every time i talk about this , what i want to do , at least a moment , i want to talk about why bodies are from meaning .
so this particular instrument is called the <unk> .
they eat and <unk> at the same time -- and some of them are still gone .
it wouldn &apos;t be a big problem , because if we were living in <unk> , we would grow our subjects , all invest , and to find a way to find a way , and you can find a way .
this is data from the <unk> of congress , and they show the <unk> <unk> of what would happen when the current circumstances and trends are going to continue .
the rocks is holy , and if people <unk> something in common , they can tell each other , they &apos;re going to trust each other , they &apos;re going to trust one .
so that &apos;s the <unk> and the <unk> knowledge , for which side they should be true .
in many reasons , the decades of the second world war has been a <unk> time .
there we are in the country as a country .
we &apos;re going to be a nation with two classes .
that &apos;s really a social disaster , and the <unk> are very worried about it .
but it doesn &apos;t exist . so i have to make them .
they &apos;re in terms of <unk> in terms of architecture .
you can see this <unk> that the protocell is actually made of the light , and it &apos;s going to move to the dark <unk> .
and i &apos;ve done almost three decades long from hospitals , and i think i &apos;ve been proud of <unk> . i &apos;m probably proud of it .
instead , i &apos;m <unk> , psychology and hatred in the <unk> school of law , i have a lot of good friends , and i have a lot of good friends , and a beloved husband , wants to be here today .
i quote from my view , &quot; i had <unk> me with my <unk> , and <unk> on the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , where we wanted to work together in a week .
and then they took me poor and legs with <unk> in the bed .
i &apos;ve never met a <unk> , who would have done this thing .
and i could put them back back and we could do it right now , and we could do it right now .
the american prisons are full of people who are tough , and many of you are there , because they never got a brilliant therapy .
so in stanford , we decided to build a different <unk> car .
these are four billion hours that are going to be <unk> in this country .
i said , there was a lot of water , and not very many people .
the <unk> in montana have already done a lot of things to reduce their water cells , but they still use millions of thousands of <unk> on water .
he &apos;s going to be paid for him to do the water in the <unk> .
i don &apos;t like to play a problem without the things that are working on the solution , and so i want to share here , like &quot; strange <unk> &quot; and films like &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and films like the <unk> , their female characters and <unk> are complex and <unk> .
his name is said , sir ?
i know , there are other companies in the world , but google is the environment that i know because i &apos;ve got 10 years ago , because i &apos;m going to use google . so i &apos;m going to use google as an case .
so , it turns out that google is a company with compassion , because <unk> think that compassion is fun .
there you come to work in the morning , and i have three colleagues who decide from <unk> sky to build a hospital in india .
there are three steps .
and i hope that compassion is also going to be very much fun for them as well as a profit .
but one day , the perfect case was a perfect case . it was a <unk> who was sitting in her house .
i met with one of the <unk> , which is the training of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which is the normal tendency is in contrast to the <unk> .
people often tell me , &quot; you know , this is wonderful , but it &apos;s extremely <unk> .
in the same <unk> , you sometimes see if you &apos;re sitting in the new yorker subway and read , this <unk> and simple feeling .
different parts of the world have a <unk> for different things .
and at the same time , the amazing piece of <unk> <unk> , who made these beautiful <unk> and <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
but the objects are <unk> from full of internal <unk> to this kind of water <unk> , and it was really very <unk> .
in fact , this chair that you open up , and then you put it down , so you get this beautiful series of objects , and that &apos;s why this beautiful series of objects are going to be seen as design as design .
so what has to do with that ?
instead , they developed a very interesting approach about my education -- which is that she would send me to a school that they could never afford to afford .
my last story , and i &apos;ve got to be a little <unk> .
and he died when the <unk> had happened to bring him to the hospital .
archie is a possibility of how to do that .
and just just the thing that i &apos;m going to do .
and we need to begin to think of our leading politicians that are critical to question .
my knees couldn &apos;t afford the school , and it &apos;s very smart .
and if you don &apos;t take you , it &apos;s true to what &apos;s not .
this is the country of years ago between politics and religion .
so our political problems .
<unk> and future leaders have been made .
he helped a birth to a period of birth .
it &apos;s the heart of medical care .
i &apos;m going to sell this only to every clinic in the world .
now , when i got this , i was -- <unk> the <unk> -- completely except me , do you understand ?
now , in a few weeks ago , <unk> is a big girl .
and as you can see , the lifespan is short .
the lifespan has been <unk> .
this is the very best technology for this region : <unk> .
let &apos;s start with the water .
but you have to share with the world .
the generation turns out <unk> .
so many hundred people come up to a <unk> march , and a idiot or <unk> , a rock , you know who &apos;s going to come back from the cameras . this is one guy .
and it &apos;s also about humor . humor is such a strong force that can move the game , and he was in poland a very big role .
now , <unk> : how will it be in the arab world ?
and she said , &quot; i saw your talk in life .
i said , &quot; if 500 to 1,000 or 2,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing <unk> than that .
and i see them .
and everybody ended up in the <unk> , and he said , &quot; yeah ! &quot;
i know your father was never in <unk> , he was <unk> .
the other thing you &apos;ve got to know about shame , it &apos;s absolutely <unk> by the gender .
i said , &quot; yeah . &quot;
we want to be with them and you &apos;re talking about them .
and if we go back and <unk> ...
if i got a ant in the rice , i couldn &apos;t see it , i couldn &apos;t see it .
and so that helped us create a very <unk> and very powerful organization , and a system that they use .
we &apos;ve got a simple structure in a <unk> <unk> , and we &apos;re doing this kind of <unk> through a doctor with a doctor for every patient .
our <unk> are <unk> faster , which is what we have a healthy profit , and that even though we treat many people to treat free .
this is a hard challenge .
for example , we can get digital content with physical phenomena .
wouldn &apos;t it be a way to make mobile mobile phones ?
it was , as i couldn &apos;t see me , as if i was invisible .
and yet , no one had ever heard a <unk> , or i saw this situation , and this situation means the creative new ways of understanding it and knowledge , because now you &apos;ve got this concept in your head in your head .
like <unk> , the hole is <unk> , at least <unk> , but not without an enormous price .
don &apos;t you .
and it &apos;s also the story of modern capitalism , because it was the wealth of this country , which is a system called the <unk> system , a system that can &apos;t survive with <unk> growth and <unk> .
the oil is not liquid .
now , you might have more headlines like this .
great show . man , that was good !
bf : ... like in the left .
dh : all right , imagine here .
<unk> : can i think about it ?
dh : does it just <unk> , say ?
dh : i &apos;m going to go .
dh : the french judge ...
dh : i &apos;m going to be -- you know , i &apos;m going to put it down there with my <unk> .
bf : from six to seven . dh : this is the world war . bf : right ?
it &apos;s less known than the two , because he had this idea to build the mechanical <unk> , and never a built .
but if yes , you would see something like this very , very similar .
this is from a journalist that they <unk> .
there are plans .
they know the problem we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
<unk> and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> and diana , the army and <unk> , that &apos;s love !
and after me seven years ago , i &apos;m sitting in the wheelchair in the wheelchair , i &apos;ve done more in life in the wheelchair as it was out of him .
in generations , we &apos;ve done our children as much as millions of different species that are living with us .
but it &apos;s not a regular film .
but in fact , if i was in the bottom of this screen , with the resolution of <unk> x <unk> , we would need 3,000 centimeters , to get a look at the genome .
what does this mean for medicine ?
and this is how he had the biomass of his children .
it &apos;s because there was somebody in the audience who want to stop to eat .
imagine , in the year , in the year , the <unk> <unk> doesn &apos;t only have their <unk> <unk> , but also their personal genome .
and so i ask them all the time and to go and make the <unk> revolution that happens around them .
and we &apos;ve got a <unk> , <unk> <unk> with a special <unk> , which is in the dramatic part of the <unk> part of the <unk> , and it &apos;s moving down the <unk> of the hip .
i &apos;m going to be able to see that technology can allow us to see a lot of these survivors .
on the iphone , on what the surgeon <unk> , they <unk> a <unk> of gas and <unk> died .
it &apos;s exciting . it can produce the <unk> of the time , so we &apos;re going to create a lot of new particles , so we &apos;re going to use a lot of new particles .
the most famous replicator is the electric .
they tell us what changes changes .
but this is how new theories work .
a lot of people think it &apos;s the most important structure in mathematics .
the only way of its mental health , in the middle of all of the nature , to get lucky and happiness , is to get the balance and a perspective in life . i &apos;ve got a perspective in life .
the pattern of dots that i showed you is actually describe the symmetries of this <unk> <unk> , which <unk> , moving , and on the <unk> .
and we &apos;ve heard about the story of history , from the <unk> of humanity by genetic <unk> .
in the <unk> , we find many , many examples of compassion , <unk> for love and real altruism .
most importantly , i believe it is to be able to work with little groups of women , to give you the opportunity to give you the possibility of <unk> .
and you know what i mean . i &apos;m talking about pollution .
take the <unk> for all the problems that we have in the planet , in the environment , and in the social , it &apos;s a message of hope .
and <unk> <unk> and similar things that young people are better from other <unk> than adults .
this change , this change . change change the ability to see if we worry about the future .
at working with the plastic , about the first eight years , after the first eight years , i began to <unk> some of my pieces and <unk> .
<unk> . every day of his book about <unk> ecology with the idea of suffering .
so i &apos;m here , and i &apos;ve got our youngest , and we &apos;ve got the most successful attempt , which is in the middle of the development .
the author of the book is <unk> , our <unk> <unk> . it &apos;s going to be <unk> by amazon .
this time we knew that this was a political thing .
after 15 years , i lost a child , one second when i was 16 .
i know what it means to be suffering , and if a crime is going to happen to a person , is going to be <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
but what if that &apos;s not that ?
and after a couple of <unk> prototypes , i thought i was looking at this , which is the <unk> .
you can take it up . you know .
okay . the <unk> is going to be used by thousands of people around the world .
or we could use one of these here .
roy <unk> <unk> , they always described as the european war , and that &apos;s probably a <unk> description .
my opinion of the way , my ladies and gentlemen , is that this is probably not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to do that .
they &apos;re starting to see the <unk> of a <unk> world .
but this is not the case .
the <unk> of nations , well , that we &apos;ve always had .
but now one last thing .
but if you ask the <unk> questions today , like the optimal formula for a long life , he could probably not tell you that .
it reminds me about my college time .
and the research shows that these years is mostly free from chronic diseases , heart disease , cancer and diabetes .
they have what we want .
now , we are at half .
and for a long time , we looked at the <unk> <unk> , where there is actually a high fraction of <unk> .
instead , they &apos;re talking about the next day in nature , <unk> <unk> , and yes , they &apos;re asking .
it &apos;s been done in 9 <unk> .
they tend to feed <unk> .
for the small example that i think here in the hand , we &apos;ve used to use a <unk> , which is based on my skin , based on this small light .
and so often , <unk> , no experts , the inventor and <unk> of things like <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ...
at the same time , computers were still a lot of <unk> that only scientists , and none of them had been <unk> to have one of them on home .
you only have the own eyes to come through there .
i mean that he was already seen .
that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done to do the driver of <unk> and <unk> .
and i said , i can &apos;t get them , but i can put them into the <unk> , in zero <unk> .
we had four <unk> and two nurses in the airplane .
and in fact , you can see some images , because i don &apos;t want to see on the screen .
no life , from the smallest life , until all of us here , without those little <unk> .
i <unk> on <unk> . i went up with food .
i didn &apos;t change me . i was not <unk> .
i was a writer .
so , no one wouldn &apos;t accept family if your child doesn &apos;t accept .
and then we decided , why don &apos;t use religion , because on the <unk> , the third church was very strong , and <unk> are <unk> .
we started in 2001 , and the women who said it was , &quot; we &apos;re just going to be <unk> , &quot; we &apos;re just waiting for women &apos;s family &apos;s family .
you can call it the coca-cola approach , if you like . it &apos;s exactly the same thing .
and then aids was living in all schools , started in university .
and then it &apos;s here with the american flag , &quot; don &apos;t go home without home . &quot;
these are things that are going to be done by business .
can you imagine , you can get condoms down , you can also get condoms ?
he doesn &apos;t want to be <unk> or <unk> .
so i &apos;m going to do a photograph .
you can simulate this behavior in the browser , which i &apos;m going to do for you here .
i want to tell you about my four minutes of the <unk> .
people like you all here in this room .
and she went out , like a <unk> in the african <unk> , the flag on her shoulder , and i <unk> it -- -- on the <unk> , the flag , the flag , the flag with <unk> arm , so my head under the <unk> thing .
i &apos;ve done my entire life with women and for women .
it &apos;s going to be clear that the only solution is that the only solution is to get the <unk> teeth .
it allows women to grow new trees to plants and <unk> , <unk> .
women and children , especially the poor , are all the bottom .
if you sell to early , you <unk> the value , but if you &apos;re going to take too long , until all of them , you &apos;re going to sell the <unk> .
you can see the <unk> , but you can see .
the challenge for the <unk> players is whether he thinks the other is fair or that it &apos;s going to be <unk> , and he thinks that only one or two dollars is going to be <unk> .
now , i &apos;m going to see a couple of <unk> .
we can try it . maybe we will .
so what do we learned today ?
about 10 calories will need to be able to create a <unk> food that we consume in the west .
so , how did this happen in a city ?
and on the city of the city in the east , in <unk> , they &apos;re going to be <unk> . that &apos;s why it &apos;s called <unk> .
and in this point , our relationship is completely , both of the food as well as the cities .
the word <unk> used thomas moore &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> <unk> of <unk> .
we need to understand that the world is also what we eat .
it &apos;s the source of all morality , this <unk> act of <unk> , to put ourselves to the role of one else .
and i see that this is a <unk> intelligence , not just a <unk> feeling .
in the 21st of <unk> , we have <unk> -- two years , <unk> &#93; <unk> , a half to a million parts , pretty complex , new and exciting technologies from steel , concrete , glass .
so the next project is in the question , and you &apos;re looking at the passive nature or the passive trying to make <unk> <unk> .
and basically , you have a quality of elements .
when i was in <unk> , <unk> , i had a public talk about a group of students in the city of school .
now , we &apos;re going to look at <unk> of <unk> like flu , for example .
there are <unk> everywhere around us , and it &apos;s only going to be discovered .
can we now put the light down , so we can see it ?
so we are chemical <unk> that are different . our kind of chemical <unk> has <unk> .
but there i have to say -- and i ask myself , richard -- that i &apos;ve never done biological <unk> , and i think we &apos;ve never been able to come through a couple of hundred million years ago .
all of all of the things we &apos;re talking about is , a waste of <unk> for every prize .
he realized that it &apos;s possible to create different laws that are able to create the economy of a little <unk> to win as the incentives to win other customers .
both of these are dark in the way to <unk> <unk> , which is half as many of the people as haiti or the <unk> republic .
one of these parameters and hong kong is <unk> .
people can come to live under the <unk> , but no one is forced to be .
a lot of people have understood the idea of <unk> that people can do with rules .
how would we write a <unk> ?
you thought , a little bit more than 10 years ago that you &apos;ve got to end up to the end of this year between three and five genomes <unk> -- they &apos;re already hundreds of .
if there &apos;s very much <unk> , they <unk> a lot of green light .
the number of shared genes is a little bit more , if we put a <unk> tumor , and it &apos;s still bigger , if we put ourselves on certain <unk> of genes of genes , on about <unk> .
it <unk> his genome after a radiation , through which his chromosomes were taken in little bits , within 12 to 24 hours , and over 12 to 24 hours .
let me start with ethical and political study .
of course , that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to look at <unk> .
we call them &quot; <unk> . &quot; they focus on what &apos;s going to be .
and it &apos;s also <unk> . i grew up as poor child a <unk> family in the south bronx , every living in the past and in the present .
let &apos;s take the area of medicine .
here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the <unk> , the biggest <unk> , in the same time , on our milky way .
it &apos;s cold , <unk> and <unk> , maybe it rains , and maybe they &apos;re on the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> .
i can &apos;t tell you how that was to see the first images of the field of the <unk> surface . this was what we saw .
so here we see a film of <unk> , which shows this sand , which shows this sand , and these fibers are 100 feet tall , a couple of miles and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> .
now , the earth is still the only planet , where we know that it &apos;s full of life .
they had lost 40 percent of their country , and they would have been able to be able to get free access to the rest of the west .
<unk> : this is a <unk> <unk> .
so we created a chart .
it took only four days .
and as the rest of the brain , it &apos;s from neurons .
and in the <unk> of the <unk> , you actually find cells that are in the <unk> <unk> , which is the right thing to see the <unk> or the edges in a certain distance and the rat or the mouse , when they study the environment .
and this would be shown by the <unk> of the <unk> .
he was not the only man who wrote to a america without <unk> , and he wasn &apos;t just the only great speaker of his time .
and why would anyone care about that ?
people don &apos;t buy what they do , but why they &apos;re doing it .
the neocortex is responsible for all our rational and <unk> thoughts and language .
it &apos;s always the same three things , so we look at it .
and if you talk about what you believe , you &apos;re going to be able to get the <unk> , the belief that you think .
and the reason for the reason is that people bought a iphone in the first six hours for six hours in the left , their worldview , and it will be your worldview that everybody sees her . they were the first thing you see . they were the first .
people don &apos;t buy what they &apos;re doing , they buy why they &apos;re doing it , and what they &apos;re doing is just the evidence for what they believe .
and , by the way , he said , &quot; i didn &apos;t have a dream , &quot; i don &apos;t have a plan , &quot; i have a plan . &quot;
i &apos;m never going to forget like cartoons in <unk> over the <unk> .
so , when this is <unk> in washington , d.c. , the <unk> clinic was <unk> , they were <unk> .
and we decided to use <unk> to this purpose .
what if we had a patient , in which you &apos;re not just <unk> if you &apos;re sick , if you &apos;re sick , but that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do is to be healthy .
and they end up with the faith , the ability and the <unk> , our most fundamental ideas in health care .
i believe that the last time we don &apos;t change our health care , it doesn &apos;t be able to go to the sick , that &apos;s <unk> , but to the diseases that were <unk> .
it &apos;s a real danger today in the world today , but this is in the indian ocean .
we put it up with this <unk> . i got six tons of cocaine .
85 percent of you can &apos;t read when they &apos;re in the <unk> <unk> .
so , if you can <unk> the <unk> cooperation with <unk> cooperation , how security can be made in the world &apos;s completely different .
do i really do .
remember -- this is a fun thing to me when the <unk> were . you know , you know , you know the dots for al gore , they count the dots for bush . count it again .
the circles represent the countries .
some countries have already had statistics .
but we need to use the united states a whole piece to find the same health , to find the same health .
that &apos;s what &apos;s going to change .
this looks like a happy story .
what you &apos;re going to do here -- on what the height they live -- it &apos;s going to be <unk> .
it &apos;s about food .
it &apos;s this horrible concept of developing developing countries that have us , argentina and denmark , 50 years ago , and he said that denmark has become worse .
cities . a job of government -- that led california from the <unk> of 1989 .
and i &apos;ve shown the approach that the seemingly impossible is possible .
and the enemy is pretty weak .
we &apos;re -- despite <unk> -- with <unk> , in afghanistan .
&quot; it &apos;s not a ideal world . &quot; &quot; and your government doesn &apos;t make us step closer . &quot;
how would that be a <unk> look like this ?
so what we need to do there on the back is a <unk> <unk> .
do you want a better system ?
and the doctor says he says he doesn &apos;t get that way .
&quot; who <unk> us , <unk> the end of the world . &quot;
the <unk> is only rare from his <unk> .
it &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> , mental <unk> <unk> .
thomas novogratz : a new way to make peace on peace
i don &apos;t want to be very <unk> .
here you see the <unk> <unk> in the early <unk> , which has a lot of antibiotics in the <unk> , with a kind of <unk> cloud .
this report was on president <unk> in president <unk> , when i was two years old . haiti .
but let &apos;s say , they have sunlight , which is based on particles , and it &apos;s <unk> .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s going to happen . it &apos;s not very likely .
because we go through this scenario , and we &apos;re going to put on the current climate .
not just about how we make it better , but what are the risks and side side ?
here you see a fish with <unk> , <unk> eyes .
it &apos;s incredibly incredible . here &apos;s two people .
and so i came up with their cute invitation to just two days ago from the himalayas .
but if you look at the literature in the east and west the west , they will find incredibly different issues of happiness .
science is a deeper sense for <unk> and <unk> , a state that actually <unk> all the <unk> , and they <unk> them , and all of the <unk> and wisdom that can make us <unk> .
in experience , we know that we can be in something that we can do in something like &quot; little <unk> , &quot; and it &apos;s completely unhappy .
the mirror allows that , but the mirror is going to be not <unk> , that &apos;s not going to be changing by these images .
if you go back to that , you &apos;re going to get their <unk> to the anger , and you &apos;re going to put it back to each other , if you <unk> it .
of course , we &apos;re doing this with objects .
we &apos;re ready , 15 years for our education .
it &apos;s really a <unk> for us .
it &apos;s a <unk> place . he &apos;s designed good .
you can see what happens on , at night , at night , three of them .
not just <unk> , not just a cartoon of sierra nevada .
this is actually a television , which is <unk> the show , &quot; we &apos;re normal , <unk> .
we &apos;re going to be -- we &apos;ve got a <unk> , which would be <unk> .
one last statement -- that &apos;s what i &apos;ve done for years for years , but i think it &apos;s particularly important for this audience .
at this point , we &apos;re about two days from the interface .
this is <unk> with <unk> <unk> .
the ice can get between 5 and 25 kilometers deep .
the <unk> look at the same time , and at the end , so that it can be able to do new <unk> , while it &apos;s still in the eye of what it is .
that would give you 10,000 dollars in orbit .
the one tells you that you get 10,000 feet per second than you want to be able to get back to the <unk> .
with the right support , it can be done in seven years .
i suppose you &apos;re not going to put me from the <unk> , because it &apos;s the question .
it also formed a couple of companies where the brand is not going to work so well .
rb : no , no .
we have a video , which shows what you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s <unk> in the air .
and he said that she goes down , or he said he just said , &quot; i &apos;m going to go away . &quot;
ok , this was not hard .
i mean , there are many <unk> people who have kids , and we have this dilemma , and we have this dilemma , as we &apos;re supposed to meet them .
rb : in fact , our <unk> found that it actually said , &quot; forget the <unk> , this is the sex <unk> . &quot;
15 people went out with our differences , and they said , they would try it .
no , i want to live my life in every lot of life .
