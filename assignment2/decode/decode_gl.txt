It was a late fall from 2005 .
He &apos;s worked on a scientific ACLU Union , the United States Liberals .
I looked at me my job , but accuracy that day I felt a little bit disgusting .
So I came up with the desk of my fellow Chris Hansen .
Chris carrying over 30 years working on the ACLU , so I knew well the working of the institutions .
I told him the one that I felt a magical look at it .
I was invested in a series of questions about the crux of science and civil liberties : very interesting .
But I wanted that to ACLU aborted these problems over towards , in a way that might be a difference .
Chris was straight into the big , and she asked me , &quot; Is all those questions , which are the five that the more you inquie me ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s the genetic discrimination , the reproductive technologies , the biobancos and ...
So it goes , there &apos;s also a really cool thing , the job of the IMRf as a detector of lies and ...
Now , of course , the theme of the gene extended patents . &quot; &quot; &quot; You know ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You know ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You &apos;
&quot; &quot; Yeah , that &apos;s , it &apos;s extended by human genes . &quot;
&quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m calling the American government expide patents of parts of the human body ?
It can be . &quot; &quot; So I went back to my desk and I send it to Chris three papers .
And 20 minutes later , it came to put him to sleep doing .
( Laughter ) &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; Rait ! There &apos;s what you &apos;re going to demand ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) And it &apos;s that Chris is a big lawyer , but I didn &apos;t know almost anything about legitizens of extended and absolutely nothing about genetics .
I knew something about genetics , but it wasn &apos;t anonymous , much less happened .
It &apos;s clear that there was a lot to learn before they demand no one .
First , we had to know exactly what they paid when someone paid a gene .
The genetic patents often include dozens of claims , but the more I &apos;m talking about all are called &quot; &quot; DNA &quot; &quot; or whatever , a piece of DNA that fell into a
The defenses of this say , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t we paid the genes from your body , you paid the right genes . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s true , but the rating problem in that is nee
And the patents don &apos;t cobren an isolated gene in particular , but all the possible versions of that gene .
And what does this mean ?
Well you can &apos;t spend your genes to a doctor and ask you the examine , to see if they told mutations , without the permission of the patent .
It also involves that the titular of the patent has the right to keep that gene to use in investigations or clinical trials .
You &apos;ve got these titulares , often private companies , fechen parts of the human genome was doing somebody else &apos;s patients .
We &apos;ve got the case of Abigail , a little bit of 10 years ago with QT &apos;s syndrome , a heart disease that , if it &apos;s not about it , it can provoke sudden death .
The company that patened the two genes associated with this disease created a proof to diagnose the syndrome .
But then it went into bancarrota and never came to offrecela .
( Laughter ) But the company that would put the patents threatened with demand them by infrinding the patent .
A few years ago without being able to do the test .
Over that time , Abigail died of QT long without diagnosing .
The genetic patents were a problem that doesn &apos;t reach the patients .
Where &apos;s some way of doing them in front of you ?
So it turns out that the Supreme Court stopped on a long list of previous cases , that there &apos;s a series of things that are not patents .
It &apos;s not whether you can paten the products of nature : the air , water , minerals , the elements of the peritic weekends .
Nin nor the laws of nature : the law of gravity , E = mc2 .
They &apos;re very fundamental things , and they must get into the scope of everything , and they &apos;re going to get together .
In our view of the DNA , the structure of most fundamental life , that encode the production of all of our proteins , is so much a product of nature like a law of nature , irrespective of what if we act in our bodies or in
For us to inform better , we travel around the country to talk about different experts : scientists , professional phenomena , lawyers .
Most of us have had a reason from a political point of view , and , when less in theory , from a legal point of view .
All they thought the possibilities of going out with our ones on this subject were so many like scratch .
But why ?
It turns out that the extended office leads to issued these patents over 20 years ago .
Eventually , there were thousands of patents of human genes .
The journey of patents was very atr trench in the status quo , the biotech industry growing around this practice , and legitimate to prohibiting the genetic patents will present a year after year into Congress , without going out .
In summary : What they wouldn &apos;t be willing to have these patents .
More , neither Chris doesn &apos;t really afraid the challenges , and that says , &quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re not enough , &quot; &quot; gives more leaves to keep fighting
So we started to fix our cause .
The extended judgments often have been : Empires and demand B for some technical subject , dark and mess .
It &apos;s not in the interesting that kind of drivers , we think that our cause would slow down much more .
It was the scientific freedom , the advanced doctor and the rights of patients .
So we decided to open a cause that wouldn &apos;t be like the types that there are by extended , otherwise a cause the prol of civil rights .
They &apos;ve been able to identify a gene extended title that were spending the default for their patents to then organize a coalition of demand and experts that tell them the tribune as these paten
We think that the ideal candidate for demand was Myriad Genetics , a company with sede in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Myriad posted the patents of two genes , the BRCA1 genes and the BRCA2 .
Women with certain mutations in these genes have more chances of suffering cancer , and from ovario .
A total monopolio about the evidence of BCRA in the United States .
I didn &apos;t want to tell you that several laboratories stopped offering BCRA tests .
It took many money by their test : over 3,000 dollars .
You &apos;ve got to share their clinicians with international scientific community .
And you know , if you look at the worst around you , over a period of several years ago , Myriad negotiate to current their test for us to include additional mutations that have been identified by a team of research
It was that during that period , for several years , up to about 12 percent of the females that I &apos;ve made the proof to get a wrong answer : a negative result that should be positive .
This is Kathleen Maxian .
A sister of Kathleen , Eileen , developed cancer with 40 years and did exams with Myriad .
The test gave it negative .
The family played it .
The most likely it was that cancer wasn &apos;t going to present in the family , so the other family members didn &apos;t needed to do the test .
More two years later , Kathleen diagnosed him a cancer of ovario in advanced state .
It turned out that Kathleen &apos;s sister found out between that 12 percent of people who received a negative result false .
If Eileen received the right result , Kathleen would make the test , and prevent their cancer from ovario .
I could actually turn these problems .
It &apos;s conself of genetic organizations , of defense organizations , four scientific organizations that collectively fought to over 150,000 scientific and professional phenomena , and individual women that either couldn &apos;t
One of the largest challenges that we &apos;re facing when we prepare this case was to think about the way that we explain science .
To argue that what I had done Myriad wasn &apos;t an invention , and that the isolated genes of BRCA were products of nature , we had to explain a couple of basic concepts , of the guy : What
How you &apos;re isolated from the DNA , and why isn &apos;t it an invention ?
We &apos;ve got hours and hours with our demand and experts , trying to give them the way to explain these concepts in a more simple way .
And at the end we &apos;ve ended up lots of metaphor , like the gold .
So that illness DNA is like extracting gold from a mountain , or from the death of a river .
You could paten the process to extract gold , but you can &apos;t pay your own gold .
It &apos;s got how much work you &apos;re required to extract the gold of the mountain ; you can &apos;t patentar , it &apos;s going to be gold .
And the gold , once again , you can actually go into all sorts of things in which you couldn &apos;t go into when I was in the mountain ; with him to make heads , for example . But you can &
In 2009 , you know , we were ready to present the case .
We &apos;ve seen it listening to the Federal Supreme of the Southern New York City , and the case was asked , by the way , to the judge Robert Sweet .
In March 2010 , the judge Sweet issued its veredicto : 152 pages . One victory for us .
When we let their opinion , they &apos;ve printed them to elocuence with what described the science in the case .
I mean , our report — was quite good , but not so good .
How could we develop a knowledge so deep of the subject in so little time ?
We could imagine how it had been possible something like this .
So it turned out that the things that I &apos;ve worked on the judge Sweet back then , wasn &apos;t just lawyer — was scientist .
And not only was scientist — I had a Ph PhD in molecular biology .
( Laughter ) Vaia has a lucky !
So Myriad appealed to the United States of the Federal Cirl .
And here things put interesting .
First , in a vital moment of this case , the government of the United States has changed .
In the court of the district , the government issued a report to the prol of Myriad .
But overlap straight to their own patent office , the government came in a report on what would say that reconsider this issue to the light of the decision of the court of the district , and conclude that the isolated DNA
It was very important , and totally unexpected .
The Federal Swedish of the Federal Circutrial takes all cases of extended , and it &apos;s met their reputation very , very the prol of extended .
So even with this beautiful event , we were able to get rid of it .
And so it was .
It doesn &apos;t .
The decision was 2 against one .
But the two judgments that we voted against us , dig for totally different reasons .
The first one , the judge Lourie , created their own and new biological theory , totally wrong .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about it . ( Laughter )
Myriad followed argument that , so I had no sense .
The other judge , the Moore &apos;s judgment , said that they agreed with us in how much the DNA is isolated into a product of nature .
But we said , &quot; &quot; I want to zarapallar the biotech industry . &quot; &quot; The third one , the judge Bryson , point the reason .
You &apos;ve got to present a question that you burn that you &apos;re going to respond to the Supreme .
So , these questions could take the form of a supercongo paragraph , often a page with lots of clumshes , &quot; &quot; where such &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; there . &
We &apos;ve done that what &apos;s called the shortest question that we followed received .
Cinco words : Am I patents of human genes ?
As Chris asked me what I thought of those words , I said , &quot; &quot; Yeah , I don &apos;t know .
I think you &apos;d have to say , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s the illusion of patentables ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No .
So what the judgments have the same reactions that I &apos;ve had was the day that I &apos;d spoken about this issue seven years ago . &quot; &quot; And of course , what would I say ?
The Supreme Court just put it around one percent of the cases that record , and embrace ours .
It &apos;s the day of the oral claims and it was very , very exciting — with a lot of people outside , people who are carrying waiting from 2 : 30 of the madrubs to try and get in the
Two organizations against the chest cancer , organized a demonstration to the safety of the court .
Chris and I went together in the hall , moments before he comes to defend the most important case of his career .
I was a lot more nerve than it .
But this whole thing to panic was that when I walked into the room and I saw it around me a bunch of known faces : women who knew and that broke their stories , the genetics that sacrifice
The room also were three leaders of Project Project Project , included the co-descuptor of DNA , James Watson , who asked a report to the court , which would say that patenting genes was a &quot; &quot; tolerance . &
The Germany was a wonderful thing .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Chris was a brilliant way .
But for me , the most passionate about it was to see the judgments of the Supreme Court trying to understand the isolated DNA , through a series of seemingly seenas and ologos in terms , in a very similar wa
Kagan &apos;s judgment associated isolation from DNA to extract a medicinal medicine from the Amazon .
The judge Roberts associate it with making a plate of a plate from a tree .
And what no doubt was my favorite moment , the Sotomayor judgment determined that the isolated DNA was nature to wait . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) When we left that day of the court we &apos;ve felt very
&quot; &quot; A natural segment of DNA is a product of nature and it &apos;s not likely to be patented as just because it had been isolated .
And what &apos;s more , Myriad hasn &apos;t created anything . &quot; &quot; Vinte and four hours after the decision , five laboratories announced that they would start offering the test for the BRCA genes .
Some of them prometeron found the cheaper exams than Myriad .
Some prometeron found a more exhaustive exam that I would offer Myriad .
But the decision of the tribunal was going from Myriad .
He came up with a 25-year practice that allowed us to paid human genes in the United States .
They &apos;ve done that because they went to innovation and biomedical research .
And they helped me get patients like Abigail , Kathleen and Eileen they were able to access the exams that they needed .
So weeks after that tribunal emitted their decision , I got a tiny package in the email box .
It was from Bob Cook-Deegan , a professor of Duke University and one of the first people that I and Chris were visit .
( Laughter ) We &apos;ve built a lot with this case .
Party of what gave us the courage to deal with those risks was knowing that we were doing the right thing .
The process due almost eight years from the beginning to the end , with many heads and imprevises by the way .
Of course , it &apos;s fortunate , but there were the communities that we connect , and the alians that we created , the things that have given us dear .
Thank you .

Hi . You know , I &apos;m going to show you about eight of my projects , are made in collaboration with the Soren Pors artist .
We call Pors &amp; Rao and we live and we worked in India .
I &apos;d like to start with my first object , what I call &quot; &quot; The phone uncle . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to call myself in the peculiar habit of my uncle to ask me to constantly do th
When I grew up , the thing was the worst and I &apos;m going to see it as a form of control .
Of course , I couldn &apos;t say anything ever because the uncle is a very restted figure in the family india .
But what more irritated and puzzling was her use of the phone did .
He grabs the auricular , and he would expect me to marcase the number for him .
In response , and as gift to my uncle , you &apos;ll notice , &quot; &quot; The phone uncle . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s so long that they &apos;re doing lack two people to use t
It &apos;s exactly the way that my uncle uses a phone saying for a person .
The problem is that , when I went home and I went to college , I &apos;ve started the numbers of less their commands .
So I &apos;ve done a machine writing machine that you could give their commands and sobrires around the world through emails .
But what I had to do was take a role , put the paper in the car , write your email or order and pick up the paper .
So this device would send automatically to the person in a matter to letter into the form of electronic email .
Here you can see that we insere many electronic devices that understand all the machinery and become digital .
So , my uncle just comes with a mechanical interface .
And , since then , the object has to be grandious and having a touch of ritualism , as I like to look at my uncle .
The next job is a sensitive device to the sound that we call caringly &quot; &quot; The Pigmeos . &quot; &quot; We wanted to work with the notion of being surrounded by a tribu of deep creatures , sens
It works like this . We &apos;ve got these paneis here on the wall and , behind it , we have these little creatures that were agochan .
Instead we stay in silence , intimidan .
And if there &apos;s more silence yet , there were the weights .
And at the minimum are , I &apos;m going to get again .
So , we &apos;ve got these paneis in three walls of a room .
And we &apos;ve had a few hundred of these little pigmeos behind it behind it .
And so that &apos;s how it works .
So this is a prototype of video .
When there &apos;s silence , they &apos;re going to be behind the paneisis .
And they &apos;re like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what you &apos;re doing . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d like to ask you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m go
And they &apos;re doing immunes to the sounds that they &apos;re frightening from there to little .
Don &apos;t respond to the sounds of the bottom .
They &apos;re a train at a moment where they don &apos;t respond .
( Laughter ) But they respond to the sounds in first flat . They &apos;re doing that in a second .
( Laughter ) I &apos;ve worked very hard to make the most possible possibility .
Every pigmeo has its own behavior , psychiatric changes , personality , etc .
So this is a very premature prototype .
Of course , it was the best after that .
We did that they respond to people , but we saw that people was quite playing and children with them .
So this is a video device called &quot; &quot; A person &apos;s disappeared . &quot; &quot; So we were quite intrigued with the idea of play with the script of invisibility .
How would we possibly experience the invisibility ?
We &apos;ve worked with a company trained in surveillance cameras and asked them to create a software with using a camera that could look at people in the room , follow this people and substitute for one person with the
I &apos;ll show you a very premature prototype .
On the right , you can see my colleague Soren , who , in fact , is in space .
And on the left , you &apos;ll see the video processing where the camera does invisible .
Soren comes into the fourth . Vaia ! Faise invisible .
You can see how the camera follows and the rubber .
It &apos;s a premature video , so you still haven &apos;t got the solapament and all of that , but you &apos;re perfecting soon , later on .
It turns into a room where there was a camera looking at the space and we had a monitor on every wall .
And second people get into the room , they see themselves on the monitor , except for a difference : one person was constantly invisible where they want to move into the room .
So this work is called &quot; &quot; The shadow of the sun . &quot; &quot; It was almost like a folla from paper , like a survey of a childish print of a different hand of oil or a sun .
In front of you , this object looks like become very strong and robin and on the side , almost it seems very weak .
People were walking into the room and almost what they were thinking was some trapalding .
But instead , it &apos;s going to be able to train the wall in a brusca way .
It turns out , and it &apos;s going to happen .
( Laughter ) So this work is a caricature of a reverse man .
A your head is so heavy , full of heavy thoughts , which seems that came in your hat and your body grows from it almost like a plant .
But what it does is to move around your head as if you were standing in a very impredecible movement and extreme slowly .
It &apos;s like thank you for that circle .
Because if that circle wasn &apos;t there and the soil had been very ground , they would begin to deambular by space .
And there &apos;s no cables .
I &apos;ll just show you an example . When people get into the room , they &apos;ll accept this object .
And , very slowly , it &apos;s in a few minutes , it gets powerfully , takes speed and it seems that &apos;s the point of drop .
So this is an important moment because we wanted to infuse them in the viewer of a gut of almost going and help or save to the subject .
While they didn &apos;t need it because himself is able to wake up again .
So this work was a truly a technical challenge for us and we worked very hard , as in most of our jobs , for years to get a mechanical , a balance and a perfect dynamic .
It was very important for us to fix the exact moment in what &apos;s going on , because if you &apos;re failing in a way that you lose balance , then you would give it , and if
So I &apos;m going to show you a very fast video where we do a test . It &apos;s much faster .
That &apos;s my fellow . I &apos;m going to go .
Now you &apos;re putting nervous , so you &apos;re going to take it to you .
But it doesn &apos;t need you to do it , because you get this up by itself .
So this is a job with which we &apos;ve been very intrigued , working with the skin of the skin that we &apos;ve seen with thousands of diverse sizes of radiation , which shines like the night sky .
And it &apos;s at the scale of the night sky .
We &apos;ve developed this around one drop with a way to bear of skuche , which was homeless .
The idea was against something so cold , distant and abstract like the universe with the way familiar from a skin bear , which is very reconfordable and intimate .
The idea was that at some point you &apos;re going to look at the form of a skin bear and almost the perceiving hole in space , like you &apos;re looking at a brilliant night sky .
So this is the last job , even in process , and it &apos;s called &quot; &quot; recognize space . &quot; &quot; Imaxinade a cubie like this big in front of you in the middle of the room
So this object is in constant and contraction to create a dynamic with people &apos;s movings , like you try to turn a secret into their together or something like this .
We &apos;ve worked with a lot of technology , but actually we don &apos;t like it , because it causes a lot of suffering on our work for years and years .
But let &apos;s use it because we &apos;re interested in the way in which we help us express emotions and patterns of behavior in those creatures that we created .
As a creature comes into the mind , and almost as if the process of creation was discovering the way that this creature wants to exist , that way wants to take and how you want to move it .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So I &apos;m going to start by giving you a useful trick not technological , and all of how much it requires of you is this : you &apos;ll change it from posture for two minutes .
But before I reveal it , I want to ask you right now that you &apos;re looking at your body and what you &apos;re doing with it .
Do you see , how many of you are in many ways in addition ?
Incurrendos , the crude legs , the nocels in each other . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about it , and I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;
Sometimes we put our arms like this .
Sometimes you &apos;ve got it . ( Laughter ) So I want you to see it .
President attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to come back to this in a few minutes , and I hope that if you learn how to modify it a little bit can change considerably the development of your life .
Well , we &apos;re fascined with the body language and it &apos;s involved especially the body language of other people .
Well , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got — ( Laughter ) this , wow — ( Laughter ) a torpe interaction , a smile and a smile look , a little bit of your eye or even so
Narrator : Here are coming to the number 10 .
So this police has lucky and take a hand to the president of the United States .
There comes the first Minister — No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy Cuddy : One hit of your hands , or your absence , can give us you to talk for
BBC , even to the BBC and the New York Times .
So when we think about not verbal expression or body language — ( Laughter ) we call it that we &apos;re not verbal — we talk about language , therefore communication .
When we talk about communication we think in interactions .
What do I communicate with your body language ?
What do you communicate with my you ?
There &apos;s reasons to believe that it &apos;s valid this approach .
Socilogists have spent a lot of time or from other people &apos;s judgments .
We &apos;ve made judgments and deductions of body language .
These judgments can predict important projects in life as those who are contract or promote or those who care about a date .
For example Nalini Ambly , investigator at Tufts University , demonstrates that when someone sees 30 seconds of videos without a sound of real medical interactions , their judgments on the side of the doctor I &apos;ve done if
So I don &apos;t have to see so much with whether your doctor was or you &apos;re not incomplete but you &apos;ve liked that person and how it interacted .
On the more drum , Alex To adorv , Princeton , painted that the judgments of political candidates have done in a second 70 percent of the result of the career towards Goberno and the Senate of the United States and same , in the
If you do a wrong use of them &apos;s bad idea , right ?
Speaking of verbal language is to talk about how to judge others , how they &apos;re judging us and which are the consequences .
But we tend to forget the other viewers in which it impacts our verbal language , that we are ourselves .
We &apos;ve got to give our language not verbal , our thoughts , feelings and physiology .
Is that not that verbal language I &apos;m talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist , and you &apos;ve got the doctors and I &apos;m in a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I &apos;ve been interested in the dynamics of power .
It &apos;s something about all facial expressions not very much of power and domination .
What are the facial expressions of power and domination ?
Okay , well , these are this .
The animal realm have to do with the expansion , right ?
It &apos;s what you &apos;re doing , and it &apos;s getting big , beautiful , and I &apos;m going to fire space , basically open it .
It &apos;s going to open up .
And it works like this across the animal realm .
If you &apos;re not just limited to primates .
So humans do the same thing . ( Laughter ) Fan so when you have powerful ways and also when you feel powerful at the time .
That &apos;s especially interesting because it showed us the ancient and universal , which are these expressions of power .
This expression , I knew how proud , it was study by Jessica Tracy .
What tells us that both the people that you see from that born like the people who are blind blind to do the same when they came from a physical competition .
So that when you intersect the line of goal and they gain no matter whether you &apos;ve ever seen anyone to do it .
Fan like this .
His arms woke up in V , the cheese something elevated .
What do we do when we feel helpless ?
We &apos;ve got the opposite .
We &apos;ve done it . Involved .
We &apos;ve got very small .
We don &apos;t want to zoom with who &apos;s in our cartoon .
And both the animals like humans do the same thing .
And this is what happens when together power with helpless .
What we tend to do when it comes to power is to complete language not verbal from others .
So if someone gets very powerful with us , we tend to make us smaller . Don &apos;t imitate it .
We have the opposite .
If you see this behavior in the class , you &apos;re going to do it ?
Now that students from the MBA cause the whole language is not verbal from power .
There &apos;s people who are cartoons of the alfa , come into the classroom , and they &apos;re going to start the class , as it stands up in space .
When they sit there , they seem to expand .
So let &apos;s take a hand like this .
So there are other people that come out practically crumbling .
Look at her face and in his body , they sit on the chair and they &apos;re doing it , and they &apos;re doing so when they woke up the hand .
Here you look at two things .
One of you didn &apos;t surprise you .
Semella have to do with sex .
Women are more likely to make it than men .
Women are always less powerful than men , so this isn &apos;t surprising .
But the other thing I &apos;ve noticed is that seems to be related to the grade of students and with its level of participation .
And this is very important in the class of the MBA because the participation stands for the average of the note .
The business schools have been fighting with the difference of notes according to the sex .
A few women and men equally ratings , and then you see these differences in the notes , that seem to be attribute in part to participation .
So I &apos;ve started to ask myself : if there are people who come out with that attitude and participants , they &apos;re going to be able to do it .
What would be possible to do that each other to finxisen and what does that levase to participate more ?
My collaborator Dana Carney , who &apos;s in Berkeley , and I wanted to know if you can pretend to do it .
I mean , can you do it just by an instant and experience a result in your behavior that you &apos;ve done feeling more powerful ?
And we know that verbal language conditions what other people feel and think about us . There &apos;s a lot of tests .
But our question was : We &apos;re not verbal language what we feel and we think of ourselves ?
There &apos;s evidence of what that &apos;s like .
For example , we smile when we &apos;re happy , but also when we &apos;re forced to laugh a pen with a pen with the teeth so it makes it feel content .
It works on the two directions .
When it comes to power , it also works in the two directions .
As we feel powerful , it &apos;s more likely to let this , but it &apos;s also possible that when we find being powerful , it &apos;s more likely to really feel powerful .
So the second question actually was , well , you know , we know that the mind modify our body , but it &apos;s true also that the body modified our mind ?
And when I say mind , in the case of the powerful , of what I &apos;m talking about ?
Well , I &apos;m talking about thoughts and feelings and physiological compounds that make up those thoughts and feelings , and in my case , I &apos;m talking about hormones . I looked at the hormones
How is the mind of the powerful compared to the people that are not ?
Women &apos;s people tend to be , it &apos;s not amazing , more assets and confident , more optimistic .
They &apos;re the sense of what they &apos;re going to win even in games of randomness .
It also tend to think about a more abstract way .
There &apos;s a lot of differences . Asumen more risks .
There &apos;s a whole bunch of differences between the powerful and the ones that don &apos;t think they are .
Fisioloxically also give you differences in two key hormones : the testosterona , which is the hormone of themination , and the cortisol , that &apos;s the hormone of stress .
Their males have been a lot of power in the generation of primates have taller high standards of testosterona and low levels of cortisol .
What does this mean ? By talking about power , it will love to talk just about the testosterona , because I had to see with themination .
But the power also has to do with our reaction just before the stress .
We want a dominant leader , with a lot of power , with high standards of testosterona but sensitive to stress ?
Now , you know , actually , it &apos;s true ?
We want a person who is powerful , assetive and dominant but not very sensitive to stress , a person who &apos;s quiet .
And we know that in the generation of primates , if an alfa has to take control , if someone has to embrace the control , take suddenly that paper , in the run of as days , their testosterona elsevase
We have that evidence , that body can shape the mind , at least the facial level , and also that the paper asumar can shade the mind .
Now , what happens when you gave me a change of paper ? What &apos;s going on if you do at a minimum level , like this little manipulation or intervention ?
We &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I want you for two minutes in your way , that will make you feel more powerful . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done .
We decided to bring people to the lab and make a little experiment , those adoption , for two minutes , becoming positions , of power or weakness . So I &apos;ll show you right now five of those poses , even though the
There &apos;s one .
A couple more a couple more a couple of years ago .
All the press called it the &quot; &quot; Muller beat . &quot;
Here we have a couple more .
You could be standing up , or sitting there .
Here are the positions of weakness .
Now hurts , they &apos;re making small .
There &apos;s a very low power .
When I walked the pescozo these to protect , really .
It is what happens .
They come , costs in a jar , and we tell them for two minutes , &quot; &quot; You have to do this or what . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t see the pictures of the positions .
So we want to induce them with a concept of power .
We want to tell the power .
You &apos;ve got this two minutes .
So we asked them , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s powerful about you ? &quot; &quot; So we asked the opportunity to bet , by the end we take another sample of saliva .
That &apos;s all . So this is all the experiment .
This was what we find .
It &apos;s at the risk , to bet ; we find that when they &apos;re in a high position of a high power , they &apos;re going to turn the 86 percent .
As you are in the positions of under power , just 60 percent . It &apos;s a very significant difference .
Let &apos;s look at what we find with the testosterona .
Behind their normal situation went to get , the powerful people experience an increase of 20 percent and weakness experiences tend to 10 percent .
Again , two minutes , and they get those changes .
Now the results with the cortisol .
The most powerful experiences a 25 percent decrease , the most weak experiences an increased around about 15 percent .
It &apos;s just two minutes away these typical changes that make your brain to make it assets , safe or comfortable , either likely to stress , and I felt like apathy .
All we know that sensation , don &apos;t you ?
Semella that our verbal language has become the way of seeing ourselves , not just to each other , but ourselves .
The body can change the mind .
The next question , of course , is it — maybe a gesture of power in a few minutes change the life in significant ways ?
It is in the lab , this experiment , are just two minutes .
Where can you actually apply this ?
That &apos;s what we care about .
You think where it needs is in situations that they &apos;ve ended up , like in the demand social situations , and they &apos;re going to be able to do it .
And you know , I &apos;m going to tell you what you &apos;re going to do with your friends .
For the teenagers is on the dining table .
For some people , it &apos;s talking about the emerge of school .
Maybe it &apos;s going to be to present a business or give a talk like this or go to an interview of work .
We &apos;ve got a network that most people identify because many spent herself , the interview of work .
So we published the results , the interest press and said — well , this is what we need to do when you go to an interview , right ?
( Laughter ) Of course , we &apos;re looking outside and we said : No , by God , no , it &apos;s not what we wanted to say .
For many reasons , no , you &apos;re not doing that .
Again , it &apos;s not about speaking to other people .
It &apos;s going to talk with you right here .
What do you do before you go to an interview job ? Fas this .
You &apos;re sitting . Miras your iPhone ... or your Android , you &apos;re not going to let anyone out .
So you &apos;ve got the messages , you &apos;re incurred , by doing tiny , when you really see what you should be doing , it &apos;s this , maybe in the bat , okay ? Fa
That &apos;s what we want to evaluate , OK ?
We took people to the lab , and they &apos;re looking at high and under power again , and they &apos;ve spent a labor interview .
I &apos;m going to tell you about five minutes a few minutes ago . I &apos;m going to tell you about it .
Then you &apos;re judgment , and the judgments are trained to not give you what you &apos;re not verbal Vense like this .
Imagine that this person can tell you .
Over five minutes , nothing , it &apos;s worse than you &apos;ll be able to interrogate it .
A people hate this .
It &apos;s what Marianne LaFrance calls &quot; &quot; standing in the social movedities . &quot; &quot; It takes the cortisol .
That &apos;s the interview that we take , because we wanted to see what happened .
We &apos;ve got analyses looking at the grades , four in total .
They don &apos;t know the hypothesis . You don &apos;t know the conditions .
There have no idea that position took every person and to the finish of looking at all the ways , they said , &quot; &quot; We want to contract these people , &quot; &quot; all the positions of power .
&quot; &quot; We want to contract esou other people . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; We want to contract you . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot;
We &apos;ve got a much more positive ratings in general . &quot; &quot; What was happening ?
It comes from the content of speech .
It &apos;s about the presence that allows the speech .
Because what we &apos;ve ended up in all those relative variables to the competence : Struck right the speech ?
Is it right ? What ratings have you ?
These things don &apos;t affect . It &apos;s and what it affects .
This kind of stuff .
Each person will get itself , basically .
Let &apos;s look at what they are .
Let &apos;s take their ideas , by themselves , without any extra .
So that &apos;s what it causes or conditions the effect .
When I tell people about this , that our body changes our mind and behavior can change our way of being , told me , &quot; &quot; It looks fine . &quot; &quot; Ai y
I tell them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you the fagas .
I &apos;m not like that .
I don &apos;t want to get there and feel me like a worldwide .
So I want to feel like an impostor .
You want to get there to feel that you &apos;re not supposed to be there .
It &apos;s really important to me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and about feeling like you &apos;re not supposed to be there .
When I was 19 years old , I had a terrible car accident .
I got out of it , and I gave several loops of what &apos;s going on .
I &apos;ve done it out of the car .
I expected the intensive care unit with a damage in my head . Botron me of the university and they told me that my IQ goes down two standard standards . It was very rolled .
It &apos;s my IQ , because I &apos;d raised as superpowers , and consider me girl girl .
So I &apos;ve got my colleagues and I &apos;ve tried to come back .
They said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to finish my career .
You &apos;ve got to accept that there are other things you can do , but in your case this doesn &apos;t . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to deal with that and I have to tell y
I &apos;d put me totally helpless .
So I worked and I worked , and I &apos;ve got lucky , and I worked , and I &apos;ve had lucky , and I worked .
Eventually I graduated from college .
I took four years more than my partners , and I log to convince somebody , my wish of the garden , Susan Fiske , for which I embrace it , and I ended up at Princeton , and I felt like I &apos;m
The night before the female exhibition , they &apos;re going to get a little bit .
It &apos;s like that .
I had so much fear of worm excluded the next day that I chameina and I told her , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to leave you . &quot; &quot; She told me , &quot; &quot; You &apos
You stand , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s going to do all the exhibitions that I &apos;m going to show you .
You &apos;re just going to do it , and you do , even though you &apos;ve been frightened or even paralyzed and you end up with an extracorptive experience , until you get into the moment that y
I got up to here . I &apos;m doing it now . And that &apos;s what I did .
Five years of college grao , a few years ago , you know , in Northwestern , Muched to Harvard , now I &apos;m at Harvard , I just don &apos;t think it &apos;s ever working on but for a long
The late of my first year at Harvard , a student who didn &apos;t talk to the class in all the semestre , which allows me to say , &quot; &quot; Look , you &apos;ve got to participate or you &apos
To shortly defeated , he told me , &quot; &quot; You should be here . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We should be here . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You should be here . &quot;
That was my moment .
Because it happened two things .
The first thing I realized : It goes ! I &apos;ve no longer feel like this .
Well , I didn &apos;t feel like this , but she does it and I can get me in her place .
The second one was , of course you must be here !
So let &apos;s find it and can do it .
So I asked myself , &quot; &quot; Yeah , of course . Yeah what you must be here ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Thank you .
Yeah , you &apos;ll find it , you &apos;re going to make powerful , and you know what — ( Applause ) Vas go to the class and you &apos;re going to give you the best
It &apos;s a way that I switched .
Now I want to tell you that you don &apos;t need to find it until you do it .
There &apos;s that we find it until it turns out .
Now , there &apos;s the enough to turn and internalizing it .
The last thing I &apos;ll tell you is this .
Pequess changes can bring the big transformations .
I &apos;m just two minutes .
Before I &apos;ve been dragging to the next situation where you &apos;ve endorse , for two minutes , try this , in the ascensor , in the fourth floor , on the desk with the door closed .
It is what you &apos;re supposed to do .
It &apos;s the brain to make the best of that situation .
Subide the testosterona . Baixade the cortisol .
You &apos;re not going to take this situation just as you don &apos;t show you who they are .
I &apos;m going to tell you from that situation with the sense of what I &apos;m going to tell you are and I &apos;m going to show it .
I want to ask you before anything you &apos;re adopting a position of power , and I also want to invite you to share the experience , because it &apos;s very simple .
My ego doesn &apos;t depends on this . ( Laughter ) Complelizing , I &apos;ll show it to the people , because the ones that better can use that are those without resources no technology , no posi
It &apos;s called them because they can do it in private .
You just needed your body , privacy and two minutes to change significantly the projections of your life .
Thank you .
( Applause )
So what I &apos;d like to talk to you about is of the larger problems in the world .
You &apos;ll talk about &quot; &quot; The ecological ecology , &quot; &quot; — probably that also is a good option .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So now I &apos;ll talk about what are the great problems of the world ?
And I must say , before I keep on , I &apos;ll ask you to each one of you that collades there and paper because I &apos;m going to ask myself to see how we do it .
So let &apos;s take alipiz and paper .
At the end , there &apos;s a lot of problems in the world out there .
I &apos;ll just list some of you .
800 million people have happened fame .
One billion people don &apos;t have access to water potable .
Dous a billion without sanitation .
Fifty million people die of HIV and AIDS .
Women &apos;s ready .
It &apos;s a billion people who are summerly affected by the climate change — and sigue .
We have many , many problems on the outside .
In an ideal world , we &apos;d solve it all , but we don &apos;t do it .
The truth is that we don &apos;t solve all the problems .
And if we don &apos;t do that , the question that I think we should do — and that &apos;s the reason that we &apos;re in the session of economics — I mean , if we don &apos;t do everything , we
That &apos;s the question that I &apos;d like to ask you .
If we &apos;ve had to say , 50 billion dolares to spend in the next four years to improve this world , what do we should be spending ?
We &apos;ve tried 10 of the largest challenges of the world , and I just read it . Mud climate , scientific , conflicts , education , financial instability , richer and corrupt , malnutrition and hunger move
We think these , in many ways , open the biggest problems in the world .
The question I &apos;ve obtained would be asking , what do you think are the biggest ?
Why should we begin to solve these problems ?
But that &apos;s asking about a wrong problem .
In fact , that was the porblema of what they talked about Davos in Xania .
But naturalmetne , there &apos;s a problem if you add people to the people who are centre in the problems .
Because we can &apos;t solve problems .
The biggest of the problems that we have in the world is that we all die .
But we don &apos;t have the technology to solve that , we have it ?
So the question isn &apos;t to priorize the problems , and we &apos;ll be able to priorize the solutions to the problems .
And I &apos;ve accumulated — naturally that you make a little more complicated .
For the climate change , it would be something like Kyoto .
To scientific diseases , they could be clinical or networks for mosquitos .
For the conflicts , it would be the forces of the U.N. , and so we could continue .
What I &apos;d like to ask you what you tend to do , and that in 30 seconds — and I know that somehow it &apos;s something impossible — you know what you think are the priorities
And also — in here , it &apos;s , naturally , where the economy gets vibrating — yeartade what we shouldn &apos;t do in the first place .
What should I be at the end of the list ?
Please , it &apos;s just 30 seconds , and you &apos;ll never speak with the people , and you just imagine that they should be the primary priorities and the less priority of the solutions that we ha
The amazing thing about this process — of course , I want to tell you , I &apos;m looking for — I just have 18 minutes ago , I &apos;m telling you an important amount of my time , right ?
I &apos;d like to welcome it , and I make you think about this process , and that &apos;s what actually we &apos;ve done .
And I &apos;ve also recognized it greatly , and I &apos;m sure we &apos;re also going to have these discussions after , to think , how is it that we prioritized actually ?
Dende then , is there that you ask yourself , why would you ever have done a list like this before ?
And one reason is that the prioritized is very awesome .
No one wants to do it .
Of course , all of the organizations wanted to be at the highest of a list like that .
But it also all the organcions detailed not to be in the rather high .
And , you know , that there &apos;s many more &quot; &quot; no numbers unites &quot; &quot; that numbers one , it &apos;s logical not wanting a list like this .
There &apos;s 60 years ago that there &apos;s the U.N. , and the whole thing hasn &apos;t done a basic list of the great things that we can do in the world , and says , what should
It doesn &apos;t mean that we don &apos;t think we &apos;re to prioritize — every decision is a prioritized , so despite all we &apos;re prioritized , you know , it &apos;s just being
So what I &apos;m proposing is really to say that we had , for a very larger period of time , a situation where there were multiple options .
There &apos;s many , many things that we can do out there , but we didn &apos;t have prices , not the sizes .
So we had an idea .
Imagine that you &apos;ve got it in a restaurant and you have a massive letter , but you don &apos;t know which prices are .
You know that you have pizza , but you don &apos;t know how much it costs .
It could be a dolar , they could be 1,000 dollars .
I could be a familiar pizza . I could be an individual pizza , right ?
We wanted to know these things .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s trying to make the Consenso of Copenhagen — it &apos;s about putting prices of these issues .
And so basically , this was the process of the Consenso of Copenhagen .
We &apos;ve got 30 of the best economist in the world , three of each area .
So I &apos;ve had three of the best economists on the planet writing about climate change .
What can we do ? What &apos;s its cost ? And what about the benefit of doing it ?
The same thing with scientific diseases .
Three of the best experts saying , what can we do ?
What &apos;s the price ?
What should we do about that , and what would be the result ?
And so in ahead .
So we took some of the best world economists , eight of the best economists in the world , including three Premities , together in Copenhagen in Maio of 2004 .
So we call the &quot; &quot; I dream team . &quot; &quot; The previous of the Universidad of Cambridge decided to call it the Real Madrid of the economy .
Eso works very well in Europe , but here not so much .
And , basically what they did , it &apos;s been a prioritized list .
And then you &apos;ll ask you , why economists ?
And naturally , I &apos;m very happy that I had done that question — ( Laughter ) — because it &apos;s a very good question .
The subject is that , obviously , if you want to know about malaria , ask yourself to an expert on malaria .
If you want to know about climate , ask yourself to a climatologist .
But if you want to know that the two you must solve first , you can &apos;t ask it to any of the two , because that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
That &apos;s what they make economists .
Priorizan .
You &apos;ve got that tag something unfortunate to say , what we must do first , and what we must do after that .
So this is the list , and this is the list that I wanted to share with you .
Of course you &apos;ve also got to see on the web , and I &apos;m certain that we also talk about it as it progression the day .
Well , you &apos;ve got a list of what you &apos;ve talked about that there were bad projects — basically , projects where you spend a dolar , and you &apos;ve got less than
And then they were the right projects , the good and the good news .
And naturally , they are the very good projects the ones that we should start by doing .
So I &apos;m going to start from the last way that we deal with the best projects .
These were the bad .
As you can see at the end of the list &apos;s climate change .
It &apos;s off to a lot of people , and that &apos;s probably one of the things about what people will say should not come back .
And I &apos;d like to talk to you about that , because it &apos;s really curious .
Why do we came up ?
And the truth , I &apos;ll also try to talk again about this because it &apos;s probably one of the things in which we don &apos;t agree with the ready that I &apos;m telling you .
The reason that it turned out that they said this is that Kyoto — or do something more than Kyoto — it &apos;s not a good business simply because it &apos;s very inefficient .
It is to say that there &apos;s no global warming .
It is to say that it &apos;s not a big problem .
But it &apos;s saying that what we can do for each other is very little , at a very elevated cost .
What basically shows us , the average of all macroeconomic models , and Kyoto , if everybody would agree , I would ever would eat about 150 billion dolares a year .
That &apos;s an important amount of money .
Two or three times the global help to the development that we add to the Third World every year .
And to do very little well .
All the models show that will be missing about six years ago towards 2100 .
So a guy in Bangladesh that would get hit in the 2100s can expect up to 2106 .
But what &apos;s something right , but not very well .
So the idea and I say , well , we spend a lot of money doing something from well .
And just by giving a baseline , the U.N. estimates that by half of that amount , about 75 billion dollars a year , we could solve all the largest basic problems in the world .
We could give clean water , sanitation , basic sanity and education to all human beings on the planet .
So we should ask , what we want to spend twice as doing very little right ?
Or half doing something incrementally good ?
And that &apos;s there where it turns into a wrong project .
It is to say that yes we had all the money in the world , we won &apos;t want to do it .
Senon , that when you don &apos;t have it , it just isn &apos;t our first priority .
The right projects — I &apos;m not going to discuss all of you — but scientific diseases , scale of basic health services — the sound by little , just because , yeah , the scale of basic services of
Far from a lot of well , but also and really , but that very costs .
One more , what we &apos;ve tried and suddenly started thinking about the two sides of the equation .
If you look at the good projects , they &apos;re shown in a lot of sanitation projects .
One more time , the sanitation and water is very important , but it also costs lots of infrastructure .
So I &apos;m going to show you those four priorities that should be , when less , the first thing we solve when we talk about how we should solve the problems of the world .
The fourth largest probelma is malaria — treat malaria .
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of millions of people infected every year .
It could even tell a porcentual point of GDP to the year for nations affected .
If you &apos;ve invested about 13 billion dollars in the next four years , you could actually actually look at half .
We could avoid death from 500,000 people , but what quiz perhaps is more important , we could prevent that billion people to infect every year .
It &apos;s going to be significantly about their ability to treat many of the other problems that they have to deal with . reducing , in the long-term , also the lidiar with global warming .
A third better is the free trade .
But basically , the model showed that if you were able to make the free trade , and especially by bringing them to USA and Europe , you could basically make the global economy to help you think about
One more time , we could actually pull the 200 or 300 million people out of poverty , radically and very quickly , between two and five years ago .
That would be the third best thing we could do .
The second best thing would be to focus on malnutrition .
There are no malnutrition in general , senon a very economic path of treating malnutrition , I mean , the lack of micronutrients .
Indeed , half of the world &apos;s population has a failure of iron , zinc , yodo and vitamin A.
If you invest 12 billion dollars , you could make a deep insight into that problem .
There would be the second best inverse that we could do .
And the best project would be to focus on HIV / AIDS .
But basically , if we invested 27 billion dollars in the next eight years , we could avoid 28 million new cases of HIV / AIDS .
Again , what this does and what you &apos;re planning is in saying that we have two very different ways as treat with HIV / AIDS .
One is the treatment and the other is the prevention .
One more time , in a world spot , we would do both .
But in a world where we don &apos;t do any of the two or where we don &apos;t do it very well , we should , when less , where we should invest first .
And the treatment is very much , much more expensive than the prevention .
So basically , what &apos;s based on what &apos;s going on in a plane is to say that we can do much more investing in the prevention .
It &apos;s basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do X right in treatment , and 10 times more in prevention .
So once again , we must focus on prevention rather than in treatment , as first option .
What this does is that it really makes us a duty to think about our priorities .
I &apos;d like you to look at yours list of prioiriers and say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re right ?
So what do you do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;m going to show you something about what we &apos;ve done here ?
Well , naturalemnte , one of the things is against climate change .
Atopo many people think that it &apos;s very , but we &apos;re very likely to have done that .
We should also make climate change , if there &apos;s no other incentive , it &apos;s just because it &apos;s a big problem .
But , naturally , we don &apos;t solve all the probelmas .
We have a lot of problems in the world .
And what I want to assure you is that if we focused on the problems , we are trying to let us are in the most helpless .
In fact that we can make a lot of cool more than little well .
And I think , the truth — Thomas Schelling , one of the participants of the &quot; &quot; I dream team , &quot; &quot; he explained very , very well .
One of the things that people looked at me , and that in 100 years , when we &apos;re talking about most of the impacts of the climate change , people will be a lot , much more rich .
We even have the most heavy impacts of the U.N.
estimates that an average person in the developing world at 2100 will be as rich as we are today .
And much more likely , it &apos;s about two to four richest times of what we are in .
And naturally , we &apos;ll be even richer than that .
But the question is , that when we talk about saving people , they help people in Bangladesh at 2100 , we &apos;re not talking about a poor Bangales .
We &apos;re talking about a holding quite richer .
And so the real issue , naturally , what I mean , we want to spend a lot of money helping us a little bit , from here to 100 years , to a holes quite richer ?
What does it really help you , or want to help poor people , in these trials , in Bangladesh , who needs really help , and those who can help very economically ?
Or as they said Schelling , imagine that richer richer — as it will happen — a richer , a richer , a richer , a richer spot on the 2100 thinking in 2005 and saying , &quot; &quot
Even if you don &apos;t agree with the typical way of seeing this problem .
Of course , that &apos;s basically because the climate change has a few pictures so good .
You know that we &apos;ve got &quot; &quot; He day of ma gain , &quot; &quot; — it looks really cool , right ?
It &apos;s a good film in the sense of what I &apos;d see here , certain , but I don &apos;t think that Em ⁇ h wow deciding to Brad Pitt in their next film cause letrins in Tanzania or
So in many ways , I think the Consenso of Copenhagen and all the discussion about the priorities is a defense of the problems of the problems .
To make sure that it &apos;s not simply to make us feel good , right ?
I &apos;m not going about doing the things that have the highest gravitational measurement , but it &apos;s also going about making places where we can actually make a greater good .
Women &apos;s other objections , I think , that they &apos;re important , is that of some manera I &apos;m — or we &apos;re — I propose a false choice .
Turns out that we should do it all , in a world spot — I would absolutely agree .
I think we should do all things , but we don &apos;t do that .
In the 1970s , the developed world decided that we were spending twice than we did , right now , that in the 1970s in developing countries .
How our help has reduced half .
It seems that we &apos;re on the way to solve suddenly all the big problems .
In the same way , people also would say , but what is there from the war in Iraq ?
You know , we spend 100 billion hurts . So we don &apos;t spend that doing the right in the world .
I &apos;m totally favor .
If some of you can talk to Bush for you to do that , it &apos;s cool .
But naturally the thing I &apos;d like to tell you , that if you had other 100 billion dollars , you &apos;d all want to spend a long way of the best possible way , right ?
So the real problem , is to start again and think about what are the correct priorities .
Well , I would like to mention very briefly , is this actually the summit list ?
You know , when you ask the best economists in the world , you &apos;re inevitable enough by asking the white men and old of the United States .
And they &apos;re not necessarily a really cool way to look at the whole world .
So we invited the 80 places around the world to solve the same problem .
The only two requirements were that you &apos;ve been studying college , and you &apos;re failing English .
Most of them were , first , of parents in developing development .
They had the same material but they could move away from the topic of the discussion , as it actually made it , to turn their own ready .
And the amazing thing was that the list was very similar — with malnutrition and disease in the highest and mudanza climate in the end .
We &apos;ve done this many other times .
I &apos;ve been a lot of other seminaries and college students and things different .
All they had as a result the same list .
And that means of a big hope , really , to say that I think there &apos;s a way by ahead to start thinking about our priorities . And I say , what &apos;s the most important thing in the world ?
Of course , in a world spot , we &apos;d love to do it everything .
But if we don &apos;t do everything , we can start to think about where we start ?
I see the Consenso of Copenhagen as a process .
What we &apos;ve done in 2004 , and we hope to join a lot more people , to get a lot of better information in 2008 , 2012 .
We watch the way that &apos;s right for the world . But we also start to think about political evaluate policy .
To start thinking about saying , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t let things happen in what we can win by a high cost , not the things that we don &apos;t know how to do , but let &apos;s make
If we &apos;re worried about some things , we &apos;re based by not care for each other .
So I hope you &apos;re going to help us fix the best priorities , and think about how we work better for the world .
Thank you . ( Applause )
There &apos;s a few years ago , I &apos;ve tried out of the home keys .
He ended up getting home to visit a friend on the other side of the city because that temperature coincidentally by the two scale . I was a lot cold .
And I was in the soportal , looking for in the past , and I gave me realize that I had no keys .
In fact , you could see that they could look at them on the top of the dining table , where they stopped .
( Laughter ) But they were all closed .
You couldn &apos;t have happened night at home from my friend because in the morning early I had a flight to Europe and I needed to take the passport and the wrong .
So , desperate and dying cold , I &apos;ve tried a cave of carto , and I &apos;ve done it in the fiestra to cup it .
It &apos;s going to cost a lot of money but nor more than a ceremony in the middle of the night .
( Laughter ) Well , it &apos;s from being to neuroscience to neuroscience .
And they &apos;ve got cortisol , which elevates the heart rate modulates the levels of adrenalin .
So the next morning when I took me up after sleep little , I worried about what &apos;s going on , and the reunited that I was going to have in Europe had to be in Europe .
And until I get into the airport shown , I didn &apos;t realize that I forget the passport .
So I went back quickly home , with snow and ice , in 40 minutes picked up the passport , went back to the airport and I &apos;ve gone right at the time , but let &apos;s take my seat to another person &apos;
Or , in the case that they spend things bad .
( Laughter ) And Danny said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Danny , &quot; &quot; and Danny didn &apos;t tell me , &
It was something that takes the organizational Gary Klein to write about this thing there was a few years ago , and that &apos;s also called pretty death .
It &apos;s getting a team of experts who &apos;s trying to determine what happened , right ?
Well , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got to make sure that you &apos;re going to be a
So what I &apos;d like to talk to you about today is what we can do with you .
Some things are obvious , but they &apos;re not so much .
So I &apos;m going to start by the obvious thing .
Designar places for the whole house for the things that you perden easily .
Well , this looks like common sense , and it &apos;s something like this .
There &apos;s a structure of the brain , called the hippocampus that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to remember the location of important things . Where is the point , where you can weigh , where you li
The hippocampus is the part of the brain .
It &apos;s the part of the brain .
In fact , there &apos;s been someone who did the experiment of cutting the sense of the smell of them .
But it works well with things that don &apos;t moven too much and not with things that you &apos;re moven .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you some places for the keys .
To the passport , a specific book . The gaff of reading , on a specific table .
If you take a place and if it &apos;s scrupulous things you &apos;re going to be in your room when you love it .
And when we tried to do it , it &apos;s a picture with the mobile phone , and when we said , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what y
Look at an email with the photo to subila to the cloud .
You know , it seems obvious things .
Do you think that when you &apos;re under stress , the brain emits cortisol .
The cortisol is toxic and nuts to mind .
It &apos;s constantly recognize that under stress you &apos;re not going to be able to give you the best of yourself and you should establish some system .
I &apos;d like to tell you that when you &apos;re faced to a medical decision .
We &apos;re all at some point in a situation in a situation where we &apos;re going to be somewhere in a situation .
And that &apos;s what I want to talk about .
or whatever decision we had to do is to make it have to do that .
suppose you &apos;re going to go into the doctor and this says , &quot; &quot; I have the results of the tests and has the colesterol a little high . &quot;
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know that you &apos;re going to tell you what you &apos;re doing .
And you &apos;re thinking about what &apos;s having high colesterol is not very good . And the doctor says , &quot; &quot; I want to reject a drug I &apos;m likely to call them statinas and
You &apos;re going to ask you a statistician .
It &apos;s the number necessary to try it ( NNT ) . And what &apos;s the NNT ?
It &apos;s the number of people who have to take that drug before that helps us a person .
And you think , &quot; &quot; What demo of statistics is that ?
The number should be one . My doctor didn &apos;t receive something that doesn &apos;t help . &quot;
But medicine doesn &apos;t work like this .
We don &apos;t know well the subtle mechanisms .
GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work between a 30 percent and a 50 percent of the cases .
So the NNT in the case of the most prescripted thing that you think is ?
How many people have to take it before they help us somebody else ?
And this according to the results that we &apos;ve been doing .
I &apos;ve also tested the data .
And you &apos;d think you &apos;d think you &apos;re going to be able to do it .
In the case of this drug , in the case of this drug , in the case of this drug , in the case of this drug , in the case of this drug , in the case of this drug , in the case of this drug
And include things terribles . Dor distress in muscles and articulations , wrong , gastrointestinal — but you &apos;ll think , &quot; &quot; A five percent . I don &apos;t think it passes me .
You &apos;ve got 15 times more possibilities than the drug to give you about it .
I &apos;m not saying if you &apos;re going to make it through it .
It &apos;s just that you should have this conversation with your doctor .
You &apos;re going to have access to this information to be able to talk to you .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m talking about this number to surprise but actually the NNT NNT .
The extraction of the prostata by cancer , the NNT &apos;s 49 .
Yeah : there &apos;s that we &apos;re going to cause 49 deaths by each person who gets help .
And the side effects in this case give up 50 percent of the patients .
They &apos;ve made helpless , family disfunction , they &apos;re incontinence fecal .
Now , the idea of the pretty death for that conversation progression .
The ideal is not to have to create all of this at the time .
Then you have to think about issues like the quality of life .
They &apos;re things in what we might think now and false with the family and their loved ones .
Do you remember : under stress the brain emits cortisol and one of the things that happens at that moment is that if you &apos;re getting a lot of systems .
So evolution gives us explanation .
It &apos;s because if your body invented metabolism in these things , and you &apos;re not reacting to quickly .
But fortunately , one of the things that you &apos;ve been just asked Danny Kahneman and their colleagues .
So we need to train us to think anticipated in these kinds of situations .
I think the most important thing is to recognize that we all have defects .
At some point we &apos;re going to wrong .
The idea is to think anticipated in what may be these wrong ways , establish systems that can minimize the injuries or simply to avoid that these bad things happen .
So I went back to that night snow in Montreal . You went back from the journey with the poster of the door of the house inside and an easy code to remember .
There are totally organized crime , and they &apos;re totally organized crime .
Bo day !
Are you going to be ? &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; You know , what &apos;s going to be ? &quot; &quot; They were amazing ? &quot; &quot
Have you ever done it . Okay , it doesn &apos;t have anything .
&quot; &quot; A letter , please ? &quot; &quot; &#91; in Arabic &#93;
It walked to strange , and I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to be able to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s what I &apos;ve done .
&quot; &quot; Ven , you see , you &apos;ve got this ! &quot; &quot; I said , the shrimp .
It looks angry for you to speak with me .
It &apos;s just one word did that a young man said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like you to do it . &quot; &quot; And I didn &apos;t want to tell you .
How do you speak like this ?
Naquel moment I &apos;ve started to think about .
It &apos;s a very long time , and it does so much .
How do you get here ?
At this same moment right now .
After all , it &apos;s all about it .
It &apos;s a language that we &apos;re going to use in college and we &apos;re going to let go of work . It &apos;s a language that we &apos;re going to have .
( Laughter ) But we &apos;ve got another more important reality , but we &apos;ve got another more important reality , but we &apos;ve got another more important reality , but we &apos;ve got an
But there &apos;s a lot of studies that are supposed to perform other languages , and there are studies that are supposed to be able to perform other languages , and there &apos;s a lot
When they started writing in Arabic , they &apos;re going to get the same thing .
So all of their ideas , their images , and with determined ideas .
And when I started writing in English in English .
When you let your write in English , you &apos;re going to give you something that you &apos;re looking for .
You can feel that it &apos;s the same person &apos;s same person .
In second place , they say it &apos;s kill your language .
This reality is really nice by the developed societies .
The Germans , the French .
It wasn &apos;t going to take us , but I &apos;d like to make that world , but I &apos;d like to get to ourselves , but I &apos;d like to make that world .
It &apos;s something that you &apos;ve done to make that developed world . How Turkey , Malaysia and others , who were carrying them their language at the time they &apos;ve advance , protec
It &apos;s going to take it to your cartoon .
Because if you take any Turk product know that it &apos;s not a local product .
No one would believe it were a local product .
They went back to be consumer , consumers ignorant , and they &apos;re going to get together .
There &apos;s specific feelings there are specific feelings , and there &apos;s specific feelings there are specific feelings , and there &apos;s specific feelings there are specific feelings there a
A language aren &apos;t one , two or three words or letters posts into row .
or whether a son you arrive and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Dad &quot; &quot; &#91; in English &#93; , a living when people went on the street saying &quot; &quot; freedom &#91; in English
How would you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see problem anymore , it &apos;s better than just looks and let it talk about it .
What I mean is that those expressions tragled a specific remember .
I have a friend that French speaks got married with a French .
One time I asked him what he was going to everything .
And he told me , &quot; &quot; All right , but once I spent the whole night trying to translate it into a whole night .
You know that she &apos;s not able to tell it to her husband , and it &apos;s normal that he doesn &apos;t understand ; his way of thinking is different .
She told me too , &quot; &quot; He listened to Fairouz with me , and one night , I tried to translate it into it so that I could feel what I feel when I listen to Fairouz . &quot; &quot
( Applause ) Okay , what do you do and what we did to protect the Arab language ?
We &apos;re going to engage civil society .
While many people would say , &quot; &quot; Why do you worry ?
It &apos;s this point and it &apos;s cool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the problem there ! &quot;
In the campaign to preserve the Arab language , the next few years ago , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot
We &apos;ve said , &quot; &quot; We don &apos;t accept this or amtro ! &quot; &quot; We &apos;ve used that style because in that way you don &apos;t understand it .
And when somebody speaks like this , I hate the Arab .
We call it — ( Applause ) Let &apos;s change our reality , and be conventional in a way that reflects our dreams , aspirations and the day the day .
Dun way that we view like us and we &apos;re going to do it as we think about it .
So I &apos;ll just say that we &apos;ve got the photos of young people , and they were dressed with Arab character .
First of young people and things like &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; in English &#93; . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Oh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &
We are very &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; &#91; in English &#93;
And anybody who says , &quot; &quot; Huh , you use a word in English ! &quot; &quot; I tell you , &quot; &quot; No ! I adopt the word &quot; &quot; cool &quot; &quot; &quot
So , I &apos;ll keep saying &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll just keep saying &quot; &quot; the Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll keep saying &quot; &quot; Internet . &
We &apos;re going to tell you that they think they have authority about us , in that language .
A creativity in the materna language is the way .
Let &apos;s start from right now .
One novel it could make us again again .
It could take the Arab again at the higher .
But we &apos;ve got to know , and being convinced that there &apos;s solution , and that we need to be able to form of it .
In short , what can you do from right now ?
Let &apos;s see ... tuits , what are you going to do ?
Please , I &apos;ll ask you , even though my time , you know , you &apos;ve already ended up .
But they didn &apos;t write in Arabic characters latino mixed with numbers .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a good ! There &apos;s a language !
They were looking at in a virtual world with a virtual language .
And it &apos;s not easy to come back to that world and refur it .
Now I &apos;m going to tell you a secret .
The babies identify them first to his father &apos;s father .
So when I walked into my daughter , I &apos;ll say , &quot; &quot; This is wonder , my ruliña . &quot; &quot; And I have to say , &quot; &quot; This is your dad , honey
What &apos;s going on in the mind since baby ?
If we were asking this 30 years ago , most people , psychologists include , would say that this baby &apos;s irrational , iloxigo , egohetti — that wouldn &apos;t have into account
In the last 20 years , the science of development have been completely this theory .
In a way , we believe that the thought of this baby is like the thought of the most highlights scientists .
I &apos;ll tell you an example of this .
One thing that I could be thinking about this baby , who could be happening on your mind , is trying to crack what &apos;s happening in the mind of another baby .
In the end and carried out , one of the most difficult things for all of us is to try to crack what other people think and feel .
And perhaps the most difficult thing is to understand that what others think and feel is not the same thing that what we think and feel .
But anything that &apos;s going along so much of politics can tell you how hard to tell them this to some people .
We wanted to know if the babies and the small children could understand this idea so complex about other people .
The question is : how can we ask them ?
The babies don &apos;t speak , and if you asked about a three-year-old child that told you what you think , you just get a routine of thoughts about pony , and you &apos;
How can we then ask them ?
It turns out that the secret was the brocoli .
Betty Rapacholi , one of my students , and more I , I gave them to babies two prats with food : one with a bicycoli and each other with delivery rooms .
All babies , even in Berkeley , I &apos;m going to tell the chickens and I don &apos;t like the brocoli .
( Laughter ) So , what made Betty was testing food of two prayers .
And I &apos;ve seen it or not what you &apos;d probably had . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) And I &apos;d like to talk to you about what &apos;s going on .
Half of the times , made it allowed the galleries and not the brocoli — like any baby or normal person .
But here &apos;s the other half , and it &apos;s got a little bicycoli and would say , &quot; &quot; Mmmm , bigcoli .
I tried the brocoli . Mmmm . &quot; &quot; And then they &apos;ve got a few children , and they would say , &quot; &quot; Aj , puaj , chickens .
I &apos;ve tried the children . Aj , puaj . &quot; &quot; I mean , I made it as if I like the opposite of what I like to reach babies .
We did this with babies from 15 and 18 months ago .
So Betty extend my hand and say , &quot; Give me a little bit ? &quot;
The question was : to give the babies what I &apos;d like to put them or her ?
The amazing thing was that the babies of 18 months ago , that turn out to start to walk and talk , gives the chickens if you like the galleries and the brocoli as you like the brocoli .
On the other hand , the babies of 15 months are put together to her if it seemed like they like the brocoli , like they couldn &apos;t understand it .
And after looking for a long-term mouse , I &apos;d give it chicken , what you thought I &apos;d like to put everybody .
So there &apos;s two data reveals about it .
On the one hand is that the babies of 18 months ago , you know , you have discovered this important thing about human nature : that we don &apos;t all want the same .
It &apos;s more , you understand that you must act to help other people to get what you want .
And more interesting without embargo , it &apos;s that the babies of 15 months don &apos;t do this ; what it suggests that the kids of 18 months learned this deep deep of being watched in the
So babies know more and learn more than we &apos;ll think about it until now .
And this is just one of the hundred studies that were made in the last 20 years by showing this fact .
But what if you can ask now is : Why do the kids learn so much ?
And how is it possible to learn so much in so little time ?
I mean , the first view , our babies seem quite useless .
And in so many occasions , they &apos;re worse than pointtures , because we need to go into a long time and energy simply to keep them alive .
If you recur the evolution to search for answer to this mystery of why we lose so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that yes , there &apos;s an answer to that .
If you look at various different species , not just other primates like us , but also other ⁇ feors , the birds , even marsupiais like the canguros or voices , it turns out that there &apos;s relationship bet
One example of these birds that you can see here .
So on a side we have the color of New Caledonia .
The color and other children , nails , people , etc , , are very smart birds .
In certain senses they &apos;re so smart as the chimpanzees .
And this is a very stupid thing that has learned to use tools to get food .
On the other hand , we &apos;ve got our female galiban .
The chickens , so like patients , paund and gain , they &apos;re silly just like stones .
They &apos;re very good at picking big , but they &apos;re not really good at doing anything else .
It turns out that the babies of New Caledonia , the pitials , they &apos;re looking for them .
And it turns out that their mothers told themselves the worms in the mouth until the two years of life , what that means quite time in the short life of a bird &apos;s life .
Without embargo , the chickens are adults in just a couple of months ago .
So my childhood is the reason that I &apos;ve ended up in the fate of the family scientific men who &apos;ve ended up on the point of the soup .
There &apos;s something in the long children who seems to be related to knowledge and learning .
What does that explanation could have for this ?
Some animals like the chickens , they seem to create something very well .
So the chickens are very good at picking big in a particular environment .
Other creatures , like the color , they &apos;re not especially good at doing anything particular , but they &apos;re very good at learning the norms of different standards .
And of course , ourselves , human beings we &apos;re very far from in that brand .
We have larger brains relative to our bodies , much more than any other animal .
Well , more intelligent , more flexibles , we can learn more , we can survive in many more ones : we &apos;ve got emigrated by the whole planet and even face space .
And our babies and children depend on us for a lot longer than the babies of other species .
My son has 23 .
( Laughter ) So let &apos;s look at the 23 , we keep telling them those very little things in their own mouths .
All right , why would we look at this correlation ?
One idea is that that strategy , the strategy of learning , it &apos;s a very powerful way and strong to begin in this world . But it &apos;s got a huge disadvantage : &quot; &quot;
It turns out that until you learn everything , if it &apos;s indefenso .
It would be nice to give us a mastodonte and be thinking , &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d understood a cartoonist or a behavior ? What will be better ? &quot;
It would be better to know all of that before they showed up the mastodontes .
And the way that evolution has soluted this problem was , it seems to be , with a division of work .
So we &apos;ve got this period of time in which we &apos;re totally protected .
So you have to do anything . Simpleally learn .
And then , of adults , we can take that what we &apos;ve learned from babies and children and put that into practice to get out there by the world goes .
One way of thinking about this is that babies and our little kids are just like the Investigation department and the sort of human species .
They are the people protecting that investigating , the ones that only have to come out , learn and have good ideas . And we are the production and commercialization .
We have to take all those ideas that we &apos;ve learned from children and put it into practice .
Another way of seeing it is , instead of thinking about babies and children like incomplete adults , think about sticking as beings in a different development state of the same species ; like cash and the bolts . But b
If this is true , if the babies are designed to learn , and this story of evolution tells us that this is , that kids are to learn , we can expect that they &apos;re a few mechanisms
And in fact , the brain of a baby seems to be the computer of most powerful learning on the planet .
While the actual computers are getting to improve a lot .
It &apos;s been a revolution in our way of understanding the machines of learning .
And all the cause of the ideas of this man , reverse Thomas Bayes , a statistical and mathematician in the 18th century .
Indeed , Bayes provided a mathematical procedure that used the theory of the probability to characterize and describe the way that scientists had been exposed to things in the world .
But what scientists do is plant a hypothesis , something with that power to start .
So they &apos;ve ever done that hypothesis with tests .
The tests make them change the hypothesis .
It &apos;s going to go to the evaluar with new tests , and so on .
But what Bayes showed was a mathematical comedy that you could do that .
And the math are the basis of the best programs of learning that we have today on day .
There &apos;s 10 years ago , I &apos;m suggesting that babies were going to be doing the same thing .
If you want to know what &apos;s happening under these brown looking , I think it &apos;s something really like that .
It &apos;s something that you &apos;re looking at , and I &apos;m going to show you what I &apos;m looking at , and I &apos;m going to show you what you &apos;re do
I think that babies are doing very complicated calculations with the odds that we &apos;re looking at , and so let &apos;s find out how the world works .
Well , this is even more difficult to prove it .
If you ask an adult about statistics , you can feel quite stupid .
How is it possible that children make statistics ?
To test this , we &apos;ve used a machine that we called the Detector Blicket .
It &apos;s a box that if you turn it and it alone , when you get really enzyme of it a few objects determined .
And you &apos;re using this machine so simple , in my lab , and also else , it &apos;s realizing dozens of studies about the good things that are learning about the world .
I &apos;ll just show you one thing that we &apos;ve done with Tumar Kushner , one of my students .
If you &apos;ve shown you this detector would probably start to think that the way of turning it is to put a block on the detector .
But the case is that the detector works in a way a both strange .
If you &apos;re abanea a block on the top of the detector , something in which you don &apos;t think we &apos;re in a principle , the detector if you tried two out of every three times .
It turns out that if you put the block on the top , what it would be the logical , it just activates two of every six times .
So the less likely hypothesis has more obvious tests .
It seems that the strategy of abanear the object is more effective than the other .
So let &apos;s explain this data to the four-year-old children , and we asked them to try .
And with safety , the kids of four years going into the data and abanearon the object on the top of the detector .
There &apos;s two interesting data in this fact .
The first one , remember that they are four-year-old children .
( Laughter ) So they &apos;re learning to tell me .
( Laughter ) But unconsciously , you know , they &apos;re making complex calculations that give you a measure of odds conditions .
The second thing about interesting is that they &apos;re using the tests to get to an idea , to a hypothesis about the world , which seems something little likely at the beginning .
In studies we &apos;ve been doing in the lab , other similar , we showed that these four-year-old children are best being exposed to little probables than adults , the same task .
Nestas circumstances , kids make statistics to destroy things about the world . But the scientific experiences , after all , and we wanted to see if our kids experience too .
It &apos;s what we normally call &quot; &quot; throwing into everything &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; play . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got a lot of interesting studies recently that shows y
Let &apos;s show you one of the lab of Cristine Legare .
Cristine have used again Blicket .
It showed the children that they &apos;re going to let the America work , and the red are not , beyond just to show you a anomaly .
But what you &apos;ll see now is this guy &apos;s formuling five hypotheses in two minutes of time .
Child : And so ?
Child : Igual it on the other side .
Alison : Well , the first hypothesis .
Child : Nada ( Laughter ) Child : So this does , but this doesn &apos;t .
Alison : I &apos;m going to describe the sensation .
Child : Why does this happen to get away ?
( Laughter ) Child : Don &apos;t understand it .
Alison : The scientists are going to recognize that face of desperation .
( Laughter ) Child : Oh , it &apos;s because this has to be like this , and this has to be like this .
Alison : List , hypothesis 2 .
Child : So it has to be .
Child : Oh ... I can &apos;t be .
( Laughter ) Alison : Now comes the next idea .
He asked the investigator that he has to put that on the other .
It didn &apos;t work .
Child : Oh , it &apos;s because the light just goes up to here , not even here .
B under this box there &apos;s electricity , but this doesn &apos;t have it .
Alison : Well , that would be the fourth hypothesis .
Child : Now yes , if you go on it !
If you put four blocks .
If you put four building on this , you &apos;re looking at it and both for you to get into the other .
Alison : Well , that &apos;s the farm .
So this child is — it &apos;s a very riquid and elocuent , but Cristine discovered that it &apos;s a very shy child .
If you look at how you look at your children , if you ask them to explain something , what they &apos;re doing is experience .
Pretty much of the four-year-old children .
Okay , and what would you feel being this kind of creature ?
What do you feel being one of these pockets that you can test 5 hypotheses in two minutes ?
If we go to the theory of psychologists and philosophers , many told the babies and the kids are just aware , or even they &apos;re not at all .
But I think it &apos;s the opposite .
I think that babies and children are more aware than adults .
It is what we know about how it works adulthood .
A consciousness and attention of an adult parks to a focus .
But what &apos;s happening in the adults is that when we decided that something is important or relevant , we paid attention .
The awareness of what we &apos;re looking at is that we &apos;re becoming reluctible and intense , men other than the rest almost what it feels like .
We also know how this happens in the brain .
When we put attention to something , the frontal part of the brain , the part that exit the actions , handle a signal that makes you a small part of the brain if you &apos;re flexibilice , if you &apos;re
We &apos;ve got some very focused attention , guided into the purpose .
If you look at the babies and children , you see something very distinct .
I think that babies and children seem to have a more similar awareness of a lanterna than to focus .
Okay , babies and children will clock a lot of people limiting the attention to a single thing .
But it turns very well to have into account a lot of information from many sources at a time .
And if you look at your brains , what you &apos;re seeing is that they &apos;re associated with neurotransmitters that will induce learning and to plasticity , and that inhibition you haven &apos;
So that when we say that babies and children have problems for paying attention , what really means is that they &apos;re costs not paying attention .
It &apos;s called the interesting things that I &apos;d like to tell you something by just looking at what &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of awareness that we should expect of those bolts that are designed to learn .
If we want to think about a way of feeling that kind of child consciousness as adults , I think the best way is to think about cases in what we &apos;re just before a new situation in which we &apos
Neses cases awareness aren &apos;t going to go , otherwise you &apos;re expanding , why it seems that in three days in Paris there are more awareness and experiences that in all the months are back at
In fact , that coffee , that magnificent coffee that we take down , actually imitates the effect of the neurotransmitters of babies .
So what , how is it being a baby ?
It &apos;s like being swimming , in Paris , for the first time , after taking three express .
( Laughter ) One wonderful sensation , but that they used to stand up to three in the morning . ( Laughter )
But it &apos;s okay to be adult .
So I want to tell you too much about the magnificent things that are the babies .
It &apos;s well being adult .
You can do things like your shoes or cross the street alone .
And it makes sense that we &apos;ve done a lot of effort in doing that babies just think of it like adults .
But if what we want is to be like those pockets , having the open mind , be open to learning , imagination , creativity , innovation — perhaps , at least sometimes , we struggle to make the adults just think a little bit

And these are simple objects : they &apos;ve got them , they &apos;ve gone , and then they &apos;re very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very , very ,
They &apos;re the things that the victims of the genocide is in Bosnia .
All of us , we &apos;re actually affecting these mundles objects and heroes .
The fact that some victims take objects like the pasta or the cepillo of teeth is a sign that had no idea of what was going to ask them .
They &apos;d tell them that they would be worried about what &apos;s going to be worried about what &apos;s going to be worried about .
These objects were going to recover from numerous common soil from my field , and girls talked about it , the exhuman forests of the new common woods that they find 20 years after the war .
And they &apos;re maybe the biggest discoveries , and they &apos;re maybe the biggest discoveries .
Over the four years of the conflict that desolou Bosnia to the beginning of the 1990s , about 300,000 citizens , civil , most of us , disappeared , certainly killed and other 100,000 have been aniquid dur
His most have been killed , well in the early days of the war , either towards the end of the conflict , came into hands of the military serbio .
The international tribunal died feelings for crimes against humanity and genocide and genocide .
Okay is the systematic destruction and deliberate group , political , and it &apos;s an opportunity .
The xenocide is both the matanza .
It &apos;s like the destruction of property , of the cultural herdanza , and essentially from any sign of its existence , and essentially from any sign of its existence .
The genocide is not just the matanza ; it &apos;s the denial of identity .
There &apos;s always no clues , there &apos;s no perfect crime .
They &apos;ve always been remanent from the ones that duck more than their bodies framxiles or that selective and weak memory .
These objects are going to get away from a lot of common ground , and the goal of the recognition of objects is a unique process of identification that disappeared in the first act of genocide in Europe from the Holocaust to
The body should stand without discovering or without identifying them .
One time if you recover these objects that victims take path to their liquid execution , they &apos;ll analyze them out of it and get us out of it .
Thousands of them came out in plastic sandwich as they &apos;re in CSI .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re going to do is what they &apos;re going to take forests in the visual identities of victims but also how valuable evidence in the warrands of war in the developing world .
Sometimes it &apos;s called supervivintes for physical identities but visual recognition is a difficult process , and it &apos;s very painful and painful .
One time that forenses , doctors and lawyers find out what they &apos;re going to happen to be the ordinary storytelling of the storytelling .
Most of the destruction , even though they don &apos;t believe them , or they &apos;re just apparent outside of the view and the mind of the mind and the mind of the mind .
There are a few years ago decided to photograph every object exhumado to create an easy visual archives that the supervightes are coming forward .
He &apos;s going to give them the way that they &apos;re going to give them the way that they &apos;re going to give them what they &apos;re going to do .
( Laughter ) And in this case , you &apos;ll be able to recognize objects or at least those pictures as I remember permanent , fiel and impartial than what happened .
The photograph is empathy and the familiarity of these criminal objects .
In this case , I &apos;m just a tool , an forense , if you &apos;d like , and the result is the most like that possible a document .
When you identify it , you &apos;re going to stand up with your bodies , you &apos;re going to find out what &apos;s going on and you &apos;re going to stand up with your bodies , an
In all of their simplicity these objects are the testing for the identity of victims of the last remember that those people exist .
Thank you very much .

There &apos;s a few years ago so I decided to follow the footprints of the great American philosopher , Morgan Spurlock , right ?
There &apos;s some things that I &apos;ve learned with these challenges of 30 days .
( Laughter ) So the months no longer happened flying , forget , if not that the time was much more memorable .
It belongs to my challenge to pick up a photo all the days for a month .
It would never have been so much adventure .
I &apos;d also understood that I &apos;d understood .
For the way , the secret is in not to sleep to sleep .
( Laughter ) But you &apos;ll find yours novel .
It &apos;s terrible .
I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; Am I informed ingenious . &quot;
No . If I want to tell you , &quot; &quot; Am I writer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m writer . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;m going
I &apos;ve learned that by making small changes and sustibles , it &apos;s more likely to keep it forever .
In fact , they &apos;re well diverted .

I &apos;m here to share &apos; my &apos; photograph .
It &apos;s this picture ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t pick up with your cameras .
Well , my interest by photography started when I got my first digital camera to 15 years ago .
Mesturouse with my passion before I print , but it was a little different , because I went to go into the camera the process was rather on planning .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends up when you give me the pulse .
For me to photograph I had more than you &apos;ll see with you being in the identical place , in the identical moment .
It seems to me that whatever you could do .
So I wanted to create something different , something where I set out to push the pulse .
First like this : a construction on a very transited road .
But it has an unexpected gyrus .
And , despite this , there &apos;s a level of realism .
Or photographs like these ... dark and colors at a time but all with the common goal to keep the level of realism .
When I say realism , I say photo-realism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something that can be really captured but I always want it to look like that it was captured in many ways as a photograph .
First on that one will have to think a moment to discover the trick .
So this has more than to see with catch an idea that we &apos;re going to catch a moment actually .
But , what &apos;s the trick that makes it seem real ?
You &apos;ve got to see details or with the colors ?
You see it with the light ?
What is it that creates the illusion ?
The times the perspective is the illusion .
But at the end of our way of interpreting the world and how it can be perceiving on a bidimensional surface .
It &apos;s really not about if it &apos;s realistic but what we think is realistic .
So I think the foundations are very easy .
I wish it like a crebacters of reality in which we take different bits of reality and those together to create an alternative reality .
So let me show you an easy example .
Here we have three physical objects perfectly imagine , something that we can all relate to live in a three-dimensional world .
But trained in a certain way you can create something that still seems three-dimensional ; how you could exist .
But at the same time , we know that it can &apos;t exist .
So , we &apos;ve found our brain because the brain simply not accepts the fact that that really has no sense .
And I see the same process to combine pictures .
It &apos;s really about combining different realities .
So the things that make a photograph look like realistic , I think they &apos;re those ones that we don &apos;t even think about ; the things that we &apos;ve been able to bold in our life would say .
But when we combine photographs , it &apos;s really important to have into this . Because the opposite will seem weird in many ways .
So I &apos;d like to tell you that there are three interactive reactions that follow them to actually get realistic outcomes .
How you can see , these images are not very special .
But combined , you can create something like this .
So the first regre is that the pictures combined to have the same perspective .
Second , the pictures combined to have the same kind of light .
And these two images argue with these requirements ; they were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light .
The third point is about making impossible to distinguish where they start and find the different images with a perfect one .
You &apos;ve got to be impossible to say how you compute the image actually .
They &apos;re looking at the color , the contrast and the bridge in the edge that there &apos;s among the different images , addressing photographs like deep fields , deep colors and noise , and we &apos;
So this is another example .
( Laughter ) I could think this is the picture of a landscape and the lower is what it was manipulated .
But this image is totally composed by pictures of different places .
Personally I think it &apos;s easier to actually create a place that I find it , because one doesn &apos;t need to commit to the ideas that has it in my head .
But this requires a lot of planning .
And as I thought this idea in the winter , I knew I had several months to design , to find the different places for the bits of the crebacabs .
For example , the fish was captured on a way out to weigh it .
The backwards are of a different ubication .
The underwater part has been taken into a stone point .
And yes , even red , the house of the cumio of the island to that asemellase more sueca .
So I &apos;ve got to actually get a realistic result , I think it makes it failure planning .
It &apos;s always begins with a fine , an idea .
Then there &apos;s the different pictures of it .
And here every piece is very well pens .
If one does a good job to take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and at a very realistic time .
All the tools are there , and the only thing to use is our imagination .
Thank you .

In this slide , you have to look for your age on the horizontal axis .
After puberty , I got out of the map .
I &apos;m going through a technique that we &apos;re using in everybody else &apos;s world .
And the brand of the already is totally different .
It changes our model of the critical period .
We had to fix a group of control group .
But we &apos;ve been asking that paper , and we &apos;re going to ask ourselves .
( Laughter ) And another group that had just been exposed to an audio and another group that had just been exposed to an audio and another group .
But what you see here is the result of the audio , and it &apos;s what you &apos;re going to do .
Ten months ago .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) So those different areas of the brain — ( Laughter ) — ( Laughter ) that they make an area done that another if you &apos;re active — ( Laughter ) .
