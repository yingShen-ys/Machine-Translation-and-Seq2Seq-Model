By this year , this year on the planet , there &apos;s going to be about a billion person who &apos;s actually using the social media .
They &apos;re saying that they &apos;re going to die .
It &apos;s a difficult thought , but I think that &apos;s my serious consequences of who you &apos;ve got to find .
This is the first time that I thought about it after the brain of Drake C . Millera , the science of the little magazine that has died from the lung .
Milar asked my family and my friends to write a post that was a post-written after his dying .
There &apos;s what he wrote in the beginning .
And he said , &quot; &quot; This . I died , and that &apos;s my last post in the body .
I &apos;m asked as just my body to get rid of the suffering of the lung , my family and the friends of my way that I wrote a message that I wrote as the first piece of m
Let &apos;s consider a little bit of themselves .
There &apos;s 48 hours of a video of the YouTube of YouTube .
It &apos;s about 200 million blocks .
So Jeanbik &apos;s product creates 90 jobs of a country on a month .
If you &apos;re thinking about my own parents or grandparents and my grandfather , in the best case , they &apos;ve created a few photos , or a video video , or a day , and you &apos
But today , we &apos;re creating incredibly rich that we &apos;re going to live to live in the clouds how much time after our dying .
So I think it creates incredibly international opportunities for this .
I &apos;m a magazine , I &apos;m a magazine , and I &apos;d like to tell you , because I &apos;d like to take pictures of pictures of what contemporary and head w
We &apos;re already seeing some services that make us solving what would happen with our online and our online and areas in the social materials after our dying .
One of them is pretty much a year , and you have found me by some of them in the body of the New York City , and it &apos;s on Foursquare .
( Applause ) Adam : All right .
SP : Adam ?
They said , &quot; &quot; Yes .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s something that you have at any place at any time , even in Argent .
A : Hot it ?
( Laughter ) So we &apos;ll have a ifidie.net , &#91; &quot; &quot; If I die.net &quot; &quot; &#93; until it &apos;s too late .
( Laughter ) They said , &quot; &quot; Isn &apos;t it true ?
So the service makes pretty simple things : allow you to create a message or a video that can be published on Facebook after your death .
Second service has a thousand asking .
It &apos;s going to allow online to say that you &apos;re going to see these photos , video and narratives that they can post after your dying .
But for example , it &apos;s just the interesting thing .
And so what you &apos;ve probably heard about Debora , who &apos;s been able to look at the cancer room , how he &apos;s been healthy about looking at more than 90,000 hours o
I think of the pilder ability of the machine of understanding and will will will be able to look at the body of data , because it &apos;s possible about being able to look at the content
And I think as only this would have , for our digital thing , will be possible she &apos;s going to continue to continue to be able to continue to continue to be able to continue with the real world after our dying
So we &apos;re going to look at a couple of experiments .
There &apos;s this kind of service — My Nouth Ts , he &apos;s taking all of your notes into the floors , everything that you &apos;ve ever looked at , and makes the
So , as you can see , the result might be stone .
Imagine how something will look through five , 10 or 20 years of the slippery of technology .
I &apos;m going to step ahead ahead of the media and the MTI works on the roles that can be able to compete as people .
And if the robots were able to compete on the essence of a universal person , on hundreds of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of a country that has created a lot of life .
So , you &apos;re going to bring up known for the night of the choices in the U.S. in 2008 , when CNN was transformed by the CNN Department of Will.I.Am &apos;s &quot;
And what if we could use this technology for the talk about our looks of our looks like this , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on very rarely , because they &apos;
So I think that &apos;s totally maybe something that &apos;s been created because of the data that we &apos;ve been creating and new ability for them to test increases in geometric prog
And as a result , I think we &apos;ve got everyone thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , what do we want to do is become a reality ? And if yes , that &apos;s what &apos;s going to
Thank you very much .
( Applause )
You &apos;ve heard of it , you &apos;ve heard of a routine that you &apos;ve heard of .
They &apos;re going to get from Joan-Cla , who &apos;s from January .
It &apos;s from the other side , and they &apos;re from the voices of the voices , and you &apos;re going to see them from the voices .
We &apos;re going to actually realize more about a diversity of reality .
So sadly , the answer to these questions is yes .
And that &apos;s what the solution of the solution is , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , what &apos;s going to happen , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re going to
It &apos;s a piece of reality that you want to figure out .
It &apos;s a kind of thing that you can do with them and they &apos;re talking about them , and they &apos;re going to test them .
We &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re going to have these kinds of things that we &apos;ve got to do with the essence of the universe of the universe .
And the thing that &apos;s going on here is that the fish of the fish , the fish , the fish , the antennae .
And that &apos;s what these systems really difficult to take in mathematics .
What are we known about the complex system ?
It &apos;s because you &apos;re going to become a group of behavior , while you &apos;re going to become a group of behavior , you &apos;re going to become a little b
and trying to understand the system exactly that &apos;s going to do .
It &apos;s on the piece of this system .
Now , you know , literally the system isn &apos;t growing up with their own parts .
We &apos;re going to learn how complex systems are , and that &apos;s a lot of empowerment .
but why isn &apos;t the economics ?
Where are the greenhouse empowerment ?
We focused on medical networks .
And that &apos;s how much of this has been made of their husband , and that &apos;s how you &apos;re going to see this . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s how
And that &apos;s what they &apos;re going to define .
You may not have looked at that .
&quot; How are they organized ? &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
or , by the way , the TNA .
That &apos;s a company that deal with more than a country , and it &apos;s 43,000 .
There &apos;s a lot of people &apos;s mountains , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to see in the mountains , where 600,000 languages of change .
It &apos;s about 75 percent of all participants .
It &apos;s in the middle of the financial structures .
But they provide 95 percent of the world &apos;s lives .
But where are the answers to the question of whatever .
We make others do the right thing to do .
I &apos;m going to get through the analogy .
That &apos;s the same and with the entrepreneurship .
And and these core 737 percent of these countries , and these core 737 actions .
It &apos;s something that you &apos;re going to do with some kind of unlimited rules .
You know , you &apos;re going to know ease for everything .
And you say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just going to talk about what they &apos;re sort of interested in as we &apos;re going to talk about the president .
We &apos;re actually in a way in which we talk about this experience .
I don &apos;t know the result of you , but when I imagine this metropol , you see the stage of the animals — like the person here , he &apos;s going to have a kind of skirt , and
And I imagine this exactly true , because that &apos;s not going to jump .
Puds are sudden and uncontrolled .
That &apos;s something that happens with us without our knowledge .
I &apos;m a writer , and also the teacher of English , which means that I &apos;m going to talk about the words I &apos;ve been living .
You can &apos;t say , and I &apos;m going to show you a little bit that a lot of the metrophy , which we &apos;re taking to get the president — perhaps even a major part of the
So , in love , we &apos;re fall .
We &apos;re beautiful .
We &apos;re going to watch .
We &apos;re going to fall in love .
We &apos;re going to figure out .
Khan makes us nuts , and it makes us tail .
And they &apos;re going to look at their faces and then go away .
So , our metrophones are actually looking at somebody else &apos;s favorite violence .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s right .
And they &apos;re passionate about us as opposite and unexpected .
My favor of them &apos;s &quot; &quot; smitten , &quot; &quot; that &apos;s going to have a round of the word &quot; &quot; smite . &quot; &quot; And if you t
Imagine in one of the time that you &apos;re going to have 16 sizzes on the word &quot; &quot; failure , &quot; &quot; which in Brasilia is used for the remembering of God .
( Laughter ) We &apos;re going to take the same word to get goods about the love , which have been interpretated . ( Laughter )
Right ?
So how did this happen ?
How are we given to the love of the love of high pain and suffering ?
And why did we talk about this kind of very good experience , how would we have survivors ?
That &apos;s the foundation of questions , but I have a couple of theory .
And in order to reach this , I want to focus on one end of the metal , which embrace looks like nuts .
When I first started studying a math looks like this , I &apos;ve seen these metrophones about nuts &apos; age everywhere .
The history of the history of the culture that &apos;s given the love of the love of a therapy .
There &apos;s a couple of example .
Now , a number of Shakespeare : &quot; Caharan — this is the entire just nuts &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; president &quot; &quot; has always taken a little bit of
&quot; &quot; A look at me , &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to get a little bit of
That &apos;s the first time I fell in love with 20 years , and that &apos;s been enough relationships at the beginning .
That &apos;s been relationships on the first few years , so for me , this meant very tall holes and lower .
I remember this one moment .
I &apos;ve been sitting in a bedroom in South America , and I observed like my looks out of the door .
It was like , was almost north , we &apos;ve passed over dinner , and when we went back into our room , he lets put their things into the brakes and put it .
I &apos;m already not reminded of this , and I &apos;m really giving you a sense of how its son is .
I was 22 , that was my first vigvement in the country that &apos;s going on , and I was wearing one .
A week to my first home , I &apos;d known the name of the city in the city , and the city that I had to do , and the city that I needed to do was to get away , but I didn
I didn &apos;t have a nerdy girl and a very little much , and I didn &apos;t know what I was like .
It &apos;s sort of more brave for me to bring it as a moment of opportunities , but I &apos;m still .
I &apos;m just sitting there .
And then it &apos;s been taken . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s like this
But regardless of a voice , a little voice in my head thought , &quot; &quot; Wow . That was the math .
I really love it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because some part of me wanted to experience himself with the president .
Now , that &apos;s what &apos;s so strange , but in 22 years , I &apos;ve been making a large momentum . This moment I was without an unlimited , unexpected , and that &
I think that &apos;s a level I wanted to be looking at , because I think that &apos;s exactly true of love and works .
That &apos;s really not supposed to be seen by the attention that you &apos;re going to be able to take an 8 of a movie , 14 songs , two albums and one novel called &quot; &quot; White L
We &apos;re done .
That &apos;s the real novel . &quot; &quot; And I hoped that my first love will be like a nuts .
But Love someone in this way — how would my brothers totally roll out from the love of the love — didn &apos;t have been very good for me or for him .
But I suspect that this kind of love is not very unusual .
Most of us feel a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of fields in love .
In fact , there &apos;s the study that it &apos;s impossible , because that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s like , you know , it &apos;s l
That &apos;s really true .
That &apos;s the study of 1999 , and they &apos;ve been using the rat to say that the level of several of the favorite of the future is a lot of people in the people of
( Laughter ) Yes , and the level of several of the world is also interconnected with the syndrome of seasonal and depression .
So , there &apos;s a couple of evidence that looks like a pressure to change our mood and the behavior .
And the other study that most refers to this way .
Now , that lower level of services are interconnected with observing thinking about the love of the love of the love of the love that reminds me of how people went into the head of the head .
And most of us feel the feeling right when the first time comes from the first time .
average from several months to several years .
When I came back from my trip to South America , I spent a lot of time one in my room , and I &apos;ve been screwing confined by the style .
I decided that if my friends can &apos;t understand the medical mountain , I &apos;m obsessed with their friendships .
Because I stopped seeing a lot of them .
And this was probably the poorest year in my life .
But I think I felt that being wretched — that &apos;s my job , because if I was wretched , then I would start to state , as much as I had his love .
So when I &apos;d been unleashed to state it , then we &apos;d eventually come together .
That &apos;s a natural nuts , because there &apos;s no rule that there &apos;s a big suffering , that &apos;s a big suffering that &apos;s going on to the largest access . B
Our experience of love is biologically and cultural .
Our vulnerability says that looks like this , that &apos;s a good thing that &apos;s actually accumulated by the circumstances of our brains , and it tells you that the love
Now , you &apos;ve probably heard about this — I &apos;d like to talk about the needs , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like to notice that you &apos;re going to notice a c
( Laughter ) This is our culture of our culture , and that &apos;s what our culture has to do with these ideas , and to hit this ideas about love .
In this case we &apos;re talking about the metrophones of pain , instructions and nuts .
That &apos;s pretty interesting that we &apos;ve got .
Kahne plays and sometimes painful , and we &apos;ve shown this through our words and history , and then our words and history to prepare us to the city of as much and painful lo
Now , that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in the culture that &apos;s going to happen in the culture that &apos;s going on .
We &apos;re going to get along with you , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of love , and we &apos;re going to want to have a lot of life .
That &apos;s really terrible .
( Laughter ) To do that , we need or change our culture , or change our hopes .
So imagine that we &apos;ve all been less better at the president of the president .
If we were more sure , the more open to the innovation , the more they were , and they would rather fall into the love , we would have been in him .
So I know that it takes a lot of tea , but I &apos;m not the first person that has laid it out .
In the book , &quot; &quot; Metapphar , we live &quot; &quot; Mark Janis &quot; &quot; and George Lacoff , who was obsessed with a stunning decision of this hole : how to
They say , &quot; &quot; What are the leaders of our future doing , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
John &apos;s &quot; &quot; Layph &quot; &quot; and Locif is suggesting a new metrophone for the looks of the love : Caharan as a joint of art .
I &apos;m very favorite this way of talking about the president .
They say they say that metrophones has been like that , essentially , and there &apos;s a way of looking at everything else , or the ideas that we &apos;re going to get in the metrop
January and Locif say it &apos;s about everyone that you &apos;re working on your art , you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to say , &quot
And these are the ideas that are good worth of our culture of brilliance in long-term relationships , but they &apos;re also a good deal and in other perspectives — brief , scenarios , freedom
So , if love is a joint of art that looks — it &apos;s a high-tech experience .
It &apos;s something that has to do with it , Love of creativity , Love requires a workplace and a kind of kind of looking , and they &apos;re going to bring them out of the
And the love of a group of peculiar and pain .
It &apos;s eventually , every experience looks like this .
When I was little , you wouldn &apos;t have thought that you wouldn &apos;t have anything that launched the love .
When Jult &apos;s first met — or if you wouldn &apos;t know if you &apos;re going to see Julie , you couldn &apos;t be without Ramoa , which she met four days
Where are she ?
She &apos;s willing to say , &quot; &quot; How many days . &quot; &quot; And she wants to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s done . &quot; &quot; And she wants to say , &quot;
Yes ?
And as the bed , in this point of view , an activity of the number of five , Ramia isn &apos;t dying .
He was alive , he &apos;s healthy , and he &apos;s just going out of the garden .
I understand that Veron &apos;s 16-year-old in the contemporary North America , but when I &apos;ve read this picture of a picture of 14 , the suffering of Julie had a meaning for me .
It &apos;s like something that I &apos;m creating with what I &apos;m sort of being fascinated with , not something that &apos;s just given to me without my control or of any o
But it &apos;s still hard .
Khan &apos;s still sometimes absolutely despair , and when I feel myself , I should remind myself : my job in those ways is to speak of my partner about what I want to do together .
It &apos;s also easy .
But it &apos;s much better than the second vital , in which the love is the nuts .
That &apos;s the loved version of the looks not about attract or any of the things that they didn &apos;t know .
It &apos;s got to trust a wedding partners and talking about it , and that &apos;s because it becomes hard that you &apos;re really simple , but , in fact , the R &amp; D .
Because you need to stop thinking about yourself and you &apos;re going to be able to think about yourself or countries in those ways , and you start to think that you &apos;re going
So the love version allow us to say things like , &quot; &quot; Hey , we &apos;re not very good work . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not for us . &quot;
Or , &quot; &quot; These relationships were a cathedral than I plan , but the kind of thing was full . &quot; &quot; So here &apos;s the art of art very well that he doesn &
So this looks like this , allow us to allow us to allow solar systems , as I will look at .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Now , I &apos;m still in the &apos; 95 , I &apos;m still a student of my friends who were given a round from the city of President &apos;s city , and that &apos;
You know , you know , you know , if you &apos;re little , and you &apos;re going to be very international , we didn &apos;t drive away by Muslims , pretty much
It &apos;s not in southern Dakota , and I turned to the friends and wondered about what she wanted me to do with 3,000 .
&quot; What &apos;s the character that has everywhere on the side of the roads ? &quot;
There &apos;s a lot coming out of her eye .
So let &apos;s say that you &apos;re going to sit in the first place , and you &apos;re going to get it right now .
( Laughter ) I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; You know , the ones that know by the side of the roads are a Chinese side of the audience . &quot; &quot; And she &apos;s going to g
I &apos;m about what I do .
( Laughter ) This is this famous character place for the picture . ( Laughter )
So in the last five years , I &apos;ve been thinking about the last five years , which is why we failed wrong , and how do we do ourselves , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re going
And that &apos;s something that I &apos;ve spent the last five years doing about the state of the wrong state .
My choice couldn ’ t fall apart , but because of a big preference : the competition in the working place .
( Laughter ) Now , most of us would have figured out from that fact about your wrong , or although you wouldn &apos;t think about any of them .
And that &apos;s what we realize .
We realize that sometimes everyone in this room does .
We &apos;re the people we &apos;re doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
But if on the right , in this moment , my beliefs in this time , all of a sudden , all of a sudden , all of a sudden , all of a sudden , you &apos;re going to see
So what &apos;s interesting is that we live in this data team .
We &apos;re going to walk around for the same way that you &apos;re going to be able to go to the vocal and they &apos;re going to give your own voice .
We &apos;ve got an operations that we &apos;ve all given through the lives of the cocaine faith that we always have right .
That &apos;s what I get to challenge .
So my view is this problem like and each of us , on its own or professional level , right and all of us all together as a society .
So what I want to prove today is that it &apos;s beyond that because we &apos;re going to start with your right .
Secondly , this is why this kind of approach is the problem .
And I want to convince you that maybe you &apos;re going out here with a rough sense , and if you &apos;re going to see it , that &apos;s the best of all the ways of marath
Why is it that we &apos;re going to start with your service ?
It &apos;s sort of an interconnected sense of what &apos;s wrong .
And you won &apos;t have you , because you &apos;re here . I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; What are your emotions , if you don &apos;t know ?
It &apos;s an unlimited . It &apos;s an unlimited .
You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you &apos;ve got a kind of guy .
You know , you &apos;re going to know that you &apos;re going to know that you &apos;re going to know that you &apos;re going to know that you &apos;re going to sense th
You &apos;re going to answer the question , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got a sense of you &apos;re going to have a company that you don &apos;t know . &quot;
( Laughter ) It &apos;s a mistake that you &apos;ve got to make sure that it &apos;s been said , and you have another spectrum of spectrum , doesn &apos;t it ?
For example , there might be a scary sense of sense , or the sense of a parachute , or even a sense of my sense of my sense of a Chinese momentum of the characters .
But there &apos;s no way that you can &apos;t challenge any emotions .
We &apos;ll have an example of analogy .
Remember , you &apos;ll remember the multicultural companies of Louis Zuris , where are the this kind of military that &apos;s going to be able to marry you , but doesn &apos;
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going on in every evaluation of this service that will be marched out of the fear and moving from the front of the rock , because that &apos;s wh
But every time you &apos;re going to get out of the rocks right now , they &apos;re going to figure out .
So what &apos;s funny , especially when you &apos;re just six years old , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to the cathedral .
And he &apos;s going to be done while you &apos;re not going to take a long and you don &apos;t figure out what &apos;s going on in the air .
So he begins to fall .
And if we &apos;re in the same time that we &apos;re going to see what we &apos;re going to do , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking at , and we &apos;re looking for
Of course , we &apos;ve already been because we &apos;re going to look at this , but we still feel confident that we &apos;re going to have the ground .
So I &apos;m going to have to get these things that I &apos;m going to say .
There &apos;s a sense of rights that are the sense of their rights .
( Laughter ) Because the structure of this structure , we &apos;re going to find our own rights .
I &apos;m going to look at this mistake of blindness .
We don &apos;t have a mechanism that has been close , when we &apos;re going to write , until they &apos;re not .
There &apos;s another reason why we get to this sense , she more refers to culture .
Let &apos;s imagine a kind of a level of the first school .
You &apos;re going to jump , and you &apos;ve got a teacher &apos;s teacher , and you &apos;re going to see them that looks like this .
By the way , it &apos;s not my .
( Laughter ) This you &apos;re in your school and you know exactly what to think about the one classroom that made this kind of grad .
He &apos;s a spirit and a shirt , he &apos;s never done the challenges .
So , you &apos;re still given to the nine-year-old , you &apos;ve learned that , first of all , those who are born , they &apos;re going to get a lot of style
We &apos;ll learn these kinds of lessons that we &apos;re going to learn .
A lot of us , and as I think , especially in this way , treating the majority of the majority , and that &apos;s what I think , especially in this way , beca
Now , wouldn &apos;t that be a holy hole by finance , and he said , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the pa
( Laughter ) How you come out , you &apos;re all thinking about the principal , and it &apos;s an extraordinary marathon .
Hy will be .
It &apos;s mostly only if we &apos;re getting into the chest that we may have been in the chest .
Because that &apos;s what I think in this direction , if we do the mistake we &apos;re solving , that something isn &apos;t necessary of us .
Because we insist on your body , because we &apos;ve got this kind of sensitive , answer , and they &apos;re very careful , and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing
Now let &apos;s tell you about the instance .
It &apos;s something like a year because Bat &apos;s name , Bat Dickens &apos;s name was the woman to operate .
The emergence of the emergence of Bistan .
There &apos;s a dirty way of looking at Harvard , he &apos;s one of the moments of the country .
It &apos;s been a woman who has been taken and we &apos;ve been taken into the operating room .
It &apos;s been taken under a drug , and it &apos;s a bit of a bit of it , and then he &apos;s taken over here , and it &apos;s been taken off here .
And that &apos;s going to happen .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Why doesn &apos;t I get to the point ? &quot; &quot; And she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Why doesn &apos;t that be a bit of
If you talk about this building , he said , &quot; &quot; Oh , he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &
&quot; &quot; President &quot; &quot; didn &apos;t say that he &apos;s been working on the right bank . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) So why I &apos;m about to talk about th
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve ever seen before , which we all sometimes felt , to be able to gather the loneliness of how let &apos;s take a look at the calls of the world .
And when we &apos;re in their own behavior , you &apos;re going to see that there &apos;s just a lot of people who don &apos;t even think about it , we &apos;re doing this kind o
That &apos;s a giant problem for operating .
But it &apos;s still and a giant problem for society .
So think about their rights that sense their rights .
It means that your belief is servicing reality .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s something that &apos;s going to tell you that you &apos;re sort of unexpected .
It &apos;s that most of us are fielding people with other people who are used by these things that most of us are using .
The first thing that we usually think if somebody &apos;s uncomfortable , is that they &apos;re missing that they don &apos;t have an awful lot of questions .
They &apos;ve got no idea to get that information that you have in you , and if you &apos;re a space of this information that you &apos;re going to do , you &apos;ll be able
If it doesn &apos;t get that , when we get to know what they &apos;re doing with these factors , but they &apos;re going to get out of us , we &apos;re going to get for
( Laughter ) President of all the pieces of links , and they &apos;re treated , and they can &apos;t have her pocket .
And if it doesn &apos;t work , if we realize that people that don &apos;t come from using , you &apos;re giving you the same factors and the same thing they &apos;re pretty m
That &apos;s a disaster .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen to make sure that it doesn &apos;t give us a little bit of mistakes , especially when it &apos;s absolutely , and makes
So what I &apos;ve been doing is that I think that &apos;s a tragic thing , which is a condition absolutely with our human essence .
We want to believe that our minds are the kind of disagreement of the windows , that we &apos;ve been obsessed with them , and that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;re doing .
And we want to have all the observations that they &apos;ve seen before , and that &apos;s exactly the thing .
That &apos;s the same thing , and if you would and it was , the light would be incredibly nice .
And the end of our mind isn &apos;t that we can see the world which he &apos;s there .
He wanted to say that we can see the world not as there .
We might have been asking about the future , and we can imagine , and we can imagine other people in other places .
Now , that &apos;s what everybody else sees , and that &apos;s a little bit of a picture of a picture of the sky and see it , and that &apos;s it , and that &
It &apos;s because we &apos;re going to stop .
Within 1200 years , like Descartes were saying , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; and I think , &quot; &quot
And I realized that the fact that the fact that the fact that we can &apos;t see our own fact is that it &apos;s not unlimited because it &apos;s not unlimited , it &apos;s not s
That &apos;s the essence of our own embodies .
Because we &apos;re not a god , we don &apos;t really know that in this world &apos;s done .
In fact , the differences from other animals , we &apos;re trying to make this light figure out .
And I think that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and that &apos;s what &apos;
By the way , by different nations , I started listening to a lot of release programs , &quot; &quot; America &apos;s life &quot; &quot; by social radio .
I &apos;ve been listening , and I &apos;ve been listening , and your body experience is that all the classes are about the wrong stuff .
So at first , I thought , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s going to happen .
Now , I &apos;m always like I ’ m seeing the wrong thing .
She &apos;s told me it &apos;s everywhere . &quot; &quot; And the point of stories were .
But within how many months in me , I ’ m going to take an intern ’ t sort of international leadership programs .
I share this assumption of none , and he said , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s actually the case . &quot;
And he was given that the designers are going to even touch that in every graduation — moving the most .
And she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I think this is something that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; What &apos;s interesting ,
We &apos;re going to have this kind of momentum , and that &apos;s what &apos;s wrong with these disparities . &quot; &quot; So what are all of us , this audience , 
We &apos;re going to fall in love with the storytelling , the steps and the ending of the ending .
So what &apos;s going on here is that we &apos;ve given up .
But you know , that &apos;s what our lives are , because our own lives are like this .
We think that &apos;s going to be true .
George Bush thought that the attack of the Iraq was sort of like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen , and it &apos;s given people &apos;s mindset , beca
They actually happened .
So the same and Hosni Mubarak thought that will be the Empire of the Einstein to the position of my life , while not getting there , and we &apos;re going to want to go into
They actually happened .
And you &apos;re going to be thinking that you &apos;re going to be thinking and you &apos;re going to do with the love of schools , you &apos;re going to do the level of the r
They actually happened .
I &apos;m supposed to be fair that I think that I &apos;m writing the biggest book about something that I &apos;m talking about , to read , to read , which is never going to be .
They actually happened .
( Laughter ) That &apos;s the same life .
We &apos;re going to bring an incredible idea , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like , and that &apos;s when they &apos;
Don &apos;t bring up , but this session will remember our time .
We &apos;ve given all the week a conversation about innovation , and it &apos;s been made of transportation . But you know why the meaning of these innovation , they &apos;ve been lost and
So that &apos;s half the ideas that were nuts and had the opportunity to change the world — look at TED in 1998 .
( Laughter ) I didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Hey ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Laughter ) I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; Hey ? &quot; &quot; ( Laugh
Where did my picture picture , Chris ? ( Laughter )
( Applause ) They &apos;re over here .
And that &apos;s so going to be continued .
We &apos;re going to find another idea .
We &apos;re going to tell you another story .
We &apos;re participating in another session .
It &apos;s today today , as you &apos;ve already heard seven million times , is how do you look at your passion .
I &apos;m afraid , if you actually want to take a look at this , you &apos;re going to be outside of the boundaries of this tiny and terrifying space of your rights 
I &apos;m going to make my mind . &quot; &quot; Thank you . Thank you .
( Applause ) So thank you . ( Applause )
5 October &apos;s &quot; &quot; President &quot; &quot; by the name of Ele-Saad Nasar went down into the Hotel on Manhattan and said , &quot; &quot; My
Now , we &apos;ve been thinking of Nasra &apos;s beginning , but that &apos;s how we &apos;ve been able to do this story for other crimes , he and his participants started planning
In fact , these plans were cardiac information information .
But sadly , the bangam in 1993 in the universe of the universe , was not going to get there .
We &apos;ve given a result of Nasra &apos;s house on my hometown .
Ele-Sad Nasar is my father .
I &apos;m born in Platosburgh , Penarians , in 1983 in the family of a friend of mine , and it &apos;s a kind of mother called my mother , a teacher &apos;s teacher
But when I turned seven years , they &apos;re in our family started to change .
My father showed me at the side of the name that has a little little possible to see , including even most Muslims .
My experience shows that if people are aware of each other , they &apos;re obsessed with a lot of time to figure out what &apos;s all we want to each other and the same .
But in every religion , in every country would have a little process of people who are so math that they have their own faith , that that seems to use any desire to make others live by
For a couple of months , the father comes me and told me that a couple of recent weekends with friends with friends had a friends on the next to Long Island .
He said that the next morning , I go from none .
We went to the Kalverton , and that &apos;s what the FBI said .
And that day , my last were stepped into a little Iranian lamp , and I wouldn &apos;t figure out , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos
My grandfather turned to friends and said in Arab money : &quot; &quot; Lunch . &quot; &quot; So the father , the kind of father , this kind of son .
And all of a very much said that it &apos;s been made , but just within a few years , I realized her meaning entirely .
They saw this notion that I was written by my father .
So as a result of those people , they &apos;ve got a vragon that has been a vocabulary that has been a lot of bang in the underground park of the north of the universe o
That were men in which I woke up .
I &apos;ve been called &quot; &quot; house , &quot; &quot; which means &quot; &quot; grandfather . &quot;
I changed the place of the community 20 times . And that &apos;s why this incredibly changed me to the opportunities of my friends .
Every time I &apos;ve been finding myself working in one place , and you &apos;ve got time to do things and we come in another race .
And I &apos;m always a new figure in the classroom , and I &apos;m often there was a lot of Holigas .
I was told by my personality in a mystery from the particularly , and that &apos;s not to attract the attention , but as it goes , you &apos;re going to get a little bit of a classroom .
and took the computer games .
And that &apos;s what my social intelligence were saying , and it &apos;s something that &apos;s important , and it &apos;s not better to prepare a real life .
They &apos;ve been able to take people on the essence of scenarios that are like religion or race .
So what &apos;s the eye discovery of my eye ?
One of the things that hopefully drops on this set of mindset is that the president of the United States has the president of 2000 .
I &apos;m going to prepare with you , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos
This was a model of my groups that were modeled by the violence of violence .
And our groups represented by various plists of society .
On the other hand , you &apos;re paying a position to drive , I learned that one of my new friends was a temple .
Because that &apos;s what this weighs a few days later didn &apos;t have , an organic volunte .
I &apos;ve never had friends of mine , and I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sort of like , &quot; &quot;
You &apos;re going to see this growing moment that was a summer in Bush Gardens , and that was a park of the atrazy .
I saw people were most different faiths and cultures , and this experience was fundamentally fundamental in my individuals .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
And as a knowledge , I got an opportunity and I quickly found out that many of them were very warm and very good .
So , of course , the way that you &apos;ve been a kid , you &apos;ve given me this notion of a conversation with others , and for me , you &apos;re going to have a little bit
It &apos;s something that I &apos;ve been scared of a kid , with life experience .
I &apos;ve been unaware of how this is being middle-wristwrists , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking at .
And then there was The Daily Show . There &apos;s a number of John Szuart money to make me feel that you &apos;re a result of my own fanship and the guys to understand that r
In many payments he &apos;s given me a parent in which I &apos;ve had this necessary .
It &apos;s often coming up , and that &apos;s not the cause of it , so now I &apos;m good to understand that there &apos;s a lot of things that have passed away from my
I was talking with my mom about how I started changing my lightbee , and she said to me , &quot; &quot; What I &apos;m going to do with my own life .
And she looked at me from your eyes more than enough , and said , &quot; I &apos;m people . &quot;
So in this moment , I realized how much negative power is to keep this impossible inside themselves .
Zuck &apos;s brakes — that &apos;s not a name name .
I bring him when my family decided to disrupt relationships with parents and start new life .
So what are you going to do with your personality , and you &apos;re going to find your own personality and you &apos;re going to find yourselves ?
So , that &apos;s just that .
I &apos;ve been doing this in order to say that somebody when you start a story and figure out that instead of violence , there &apos;s a better garden . I didn &apos;t bec
I &apos;m using my own experiences in the paper against the fans of the paper against fans .
So I &apos;ve been doing this for opposite therapies and for their families , for the fear of pain and the countries that have been put on their way that they &apos;re doing .
We &apos;ve got memory about the opposite of an option against those immediate actions and the action of action my parents .
I &apos;m here as the usual thing that violence doesn &apos;t come up with a religion of religion or race , and that son doesn &apos;t use the way of your parents .
I &apos;m not my father .
Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank every one of you . ( Applause ) Thank everybody . ( Applause ) Thank you very much . ( Applause )
Or this might be a choice about what &apos;s going to happen .
They &apos;re not better than anybody else &apos;s totally .
You can help make a huge choice less a little bit .
When I &apos;ve been assembled by the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the University of the United States .
We &apos;re going to have a lot of people who have been able to figure out , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) We &apos;re go
We &apos;ve spent a lot of fish that you &apos;ve spent a lot of fish that you &apos;ve spent a lot of fish and you &apos;ve spent a lot of fish that y
He &apos;s severe , because the best vacuum is simply not there .
Because they &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going to happen . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Now , they &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; Hey
But so being can &apos;t .
If you &apos;re good at the vital vital , but it seems to be wrong .
I have a time on family and so on .
It &apos;s an artist &apos;s artist to let you tell you .
We have the tendency to deal .
If the altruists are on the ground .
and you &apos;ve created reasons for themselves .
We &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; What do we do , or do we make a mistake . &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen , or do we make a mistake
I &apos;m suggesting to love chocolate .
When we &apos;re creating activity reasons for ourselves .
You &apos;re going to do that one person .
It &apos;s something like this , and then I decided to get out the path , the big American solar , Morgan Spiral , Morgan Spiral .
I &apos;ve learned this because of these kinds of things that we &apos;ve learned .
And instead of making this much more vulnerable , they didn &apos;t have been much bigger , and the time became much more likely .
This picture with my challenge , when I &apos;m doing the photos every day a month .
I &apos;m never figured out , and I &apos;m never going to figure out , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m never going to figure out , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m never going to
I &apos;ve also figured out .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to go to sleep . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) If you don &apos;t go to sleep , you &apos;re not going to go to sleep .
It &apos;s like you &apos;re going to write your own novel . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I mean , you &apos;re going to write your own novel .
She &apos;s also a bit of a nightmare , and she &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on here . &quot; &quot; And she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s
I don &apos;t want to say , &quot; I &apos;m an information technology . &quot;
This isn &apos;t when I &apos;m going to tell you , I could say , &quot; I &apos;m a scientist . &quot;
And I realized that if I &apos;m doing little , gradually changes , they &apos;ve given my point of view of their lives .
In fact , they &apos;re the first one .
( Applause )
I &apos;m incredibly born in the country that comes up with the best place in the world to be a woman .
In 1975 , when I was seven years old , women in Iceland , you &apos;ve got a lot of letters .
The day they &apos;re not working , whether they &apos;ve been working , whether they &apos;ve had a career place , or just hat .
They &apos;ve been able to march in the kit of Ray &apos;s , and they &apos;ve been 90 percent of women — and it &apos;s a round and a garden asked about darkness .
Now you don &apos;t have worked in Iceland in the morning , because nothing works when women don &apos;t .
( Applause ) Because five years of the people who have had their need to become the first country in the world , which had selected a woman who was the president of the president .
I &apos;ll never forget that day , when I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; We &apos;ll never forget , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m going to show you a little bit of
( Applause ) And she &apos;s become an extraordinary pattern for me and everyone who &apos;s growing up at the time , including cotton .
And she said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s often a story about the cotton that comes up to her after several vocal vocal and saying , &quot; &quot; What are you supposed to
How are I going to be the president of the president ? &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s what women are less likely to see than men .
America &apos;s been testing in the U.S. in 2011 , said that 62 percent of the men were seeing your candidate on the president , but only 45 percent of the women .
We see this endeavor in 16 percent , and that &apos;s the kind of answer that the survival of the decade ago .
That &apos;s real salt , because I &apos;m confident that it &apos;s the world needed women and more valuable leadership .
Because my decision turned to the Civil Rights Movement , which I had to do with my own military , even without a smoke experience , walk out here ahead and to try to create the design of the
That was a trip of my life .
That was full .
It came from 20 patents of produce .
It &apos;s been taken by the number of people who turned to nine candidates , and finally got to get to the tea of tea , three men and me .
( Applause ) But it &apos;s still not the drama .
You &apos;re going to think that here in the U.S. gray drama , but I can — ( Laughter ) I can say that and we &apos;re in Iceland .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; What &apos;s the last 20 years that you don &apos;t get into , that &apos;s , perhaps , and led to this so many candidate .
And so he devised when our seat was given in the teacher because of the sum of the family of Panama papers , in which were interventions of he and his family .
So I decided to have the people of the knees , because the country has been able to hear that the country needed a fair leader .
And within a few days , the connection with the company of his comes from his family was also working in the Panama papers , and he &apos;s again with the links .
They said , &quot; &quot; Well , he said , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; What does it do , because now there &apos;s two kinds of men who can become
We &apos;re going to have nine , nine , in 45 days to choose the choices on the right looked like me not good .
I didn &apos;t even have a place in the newspap .
So I &apos;m going to talk about one percent , but everything , and each of them was the first one , that was the first one to tackle women &apos;s lives .
I &apos;d like to tell you that I &apos;ve got to get an example of how you &apos;ve got to get a place to get the table and tap on the center , because the center of
And the day of those devices that I &apos;m going to jump together with three men , and during the host , I &apos;ve learned that they &apos;ve given two and a half percent of the d
( Applause ) And talk about the problems .
The main problems that we &apos;ve got to do with this way , were interconnected to the media , and that &apos;s kind of careful and grains .
Let &apos;s start with the media .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , that &apos;s my media and the politics . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) It &apos;s something that has been made for media and politics .
It &apos;s not .
I turned out to get to see how access it is , and the host of the media .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m 87 times in a few months before I &apos;
And I don &apos;t suggest that the media keeps this connection .
I &apos;m going to find out that the reason is in the media , because in the media , by most parts , and the numbers , there &apos;s holy and unconscious patients , and we &apos
When I got access to TB , the first question is , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to take your candy ? &quot; &quot; That was the hard question .
And of course , of the association of one to two and a half percent of the voices we &apos;ll figure out .
But the media actually have value , and every time that I &apos;m going to happen to the TB , we &apos;ve seen and experience with me , because I know it &apos;s very important
I &apos;ve been with a lot of people with a lot of vocal candidates , and I &apos;ve never been able to interview .
I &apos;ve been thinking of the outside of the people who were looking at all the rest of the world , and the outside of the people who were asked .
I &apos;m working with this , but I &apos;ll tell you a computer media .
It wasn &apos;t almost almost the country of the comments of my hands or a pace .
( Applause ) Hey is going to be the name .
But there &apos;s another very important skill .
I &apos;ve been talking about how independent it is , without being able to smoke an African or a support .
And these are the gaps of experiences and access to resources , maybe expensive for our companies , but also enhance new and to do a programming different .
Our company was big , and so we may have changed the choices for others .
It &apos;s the reason why you &apos;re looking at the TB , because I wanted to show you another pressure .
And if you have access to the media that you &apos;ve been in terms of extraordinary , we &apos;ve launched the storytelling of information .
I &apos;ve been looking at Facebook , and when you &apos;ve been answering any of the questions of choice .
The miracle questions together with saying , we &apos;ve got access to Facebook , because we believed in the importance of addressing when we want to drive trust .
And if it turned out to be the problem of the young choice , I started to use Snapchat .
And you &apos;ve given me how to do this , and I used any documentary in Snapchat during my last companies .
I &apos;ve been looking at a lot of human beings , because here I am .
But , thanks to this , we have grown the number of machines tackling .
It &apos;s something that maybe lead company and another way .
So sorry , get goods about programming and not to figure out about money .
And that &apos;s exactly what &apos;s true , but it &apos;s true , and we had less financial resources than in other candidates .
So the reason why partly was that , on my view , the time was unoriented to walk about financial support .
And maybe I &apos;m making more of the most extraordinary people .
Some of you will tell that it &apos;s very beyond .
But even with the needs of the media and the financial roles , and only with an entrepreneur , but a remarkable team , we have a surprise of all the choices of the choices if they &apos;ve g
I refused to myself as you can see on the phone .
( Laughter ) The first data of the data , I &apos;m going to take a lot of candidates .
( Applause ) Well , too ear , because I wasn &apos;t able to win , but took a different place , and we were walking a long time ago from each other to almost number three voices
And because of this , you &apos;re going to see some of these kinds of people &apos;s choices , and a lot of people called me up again .
But in fact , I &apos;m going to make a group knowledge that I &apos;ve been able to make a much more high-tanding support of hand pails , and a big number of people enc

But in the morning the choices I &apos;ve heard here on TB , she was smart , confident , she was honest and sustainable my mom .
The machine that was finding was to open my company my company .
( Applause ) But there was another one .
We &apos;ve got a girlfriend &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s girl &apos;s girl &apos;s girl &apos;s girl &apos;s girl &apos;s girl &apos;s girl wh
Some of you : Oh !
This picture for me is already moving .
We can achieve an attack that you see .
Yeah black fear and problems .
( Applause ) It &apos;s in creating a need , and it &apos;s time that it &apos;s given to women &apos;s time , let &apos;s say it &apos;s going to be the CEO of the

( Applause ) And we need more to use this .
We &apos;ve seen the choices that we &apos;ve been doing , and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing , because that &apos;s what we feel ourselves .
It &apos;s not a good thing to do with this plant .
You have to just get out of this , and you have your family and your friends , all who will work with you , if you &apos;re getting good , you raise above everything th
We &apos;ve had well spent time , and I &apos;ve looked at why learned during this trip , more than I could talk to you today .
But be sure , it was heavy job .
For nearly those periods I weren &apos;t sleeping .
So I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going to show you and I &apos;m going to show you , and I &apos;m going to show you that I &apos;m going to show
It tells you a good friend of mine , and you &apos;ll be able to get your perspective , but it &apos;s never been made of you .
I &apos;m also going to reach out , and you &apos;re all thinking , you know , in any key , you &apos;re going to see the key thing — that &apos;s your team .
People are left behind who separate your values and they &apos;re mixed up in the other .
And for me , it &apos;s a form of success , I &apos;ve been blown away from a husband today here today , an extraordinary family — ( Applause ) and friends , we &apos;ve gone
I &apos;m just saying that the head of any of the world &apos;s rights was said to them , as I put the decision that will be good , when I make a seven percent .
I &apos;ve put him on the soil , because perhaps he &apos;s got right , and you &apos;ve given my own experience .
But in the morning , I decided to show you that he &apos;s done .
Very important this , because I &apos;m actually very little sleeping and the hard work worked as well as people with me .
We &apos;ve never been able to achieve a lot if you &apos;re going to forget a clip about ourselves .
I think it &apos;s really important that you &apos;re going to have these very important two things : they &apos;re going to attempt to tell people and on the right that you &apos;re going

And I did that all the tries to inspire on this other .
The third word is &quot; &quot; Gagnsteredi . &quot; &quot; And I was open for all the trips .
I didn &apos;t have any societies , about everything you can learn on Facebook or on our websites .
I think it &apos;s impossible that you &apos;ve got the pressure , you deserve to tell their questions .
There &apos;s a lot of less important word by the end of this room that you don &apos;t have field , we &apos;ve got a company of Girlpower &apos;s company , wh

And that &apos;s what maybe all in this room are ready to go to Iceland how you &apos;ve given up for you .
We &apos;re going to have a large number of rights rights , but there &apos;s something that we can take in Iceland , as well as before , that &apos;s inspiring .
I mean , that &apos;s old enough to remember 1975 , if the women of Iceland you were in the street , and that &apos;s really become high factors to launch women &apos;s movement .
You &apos;ve said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve given up before . &quot; &quot; So you &apos;re going to find the background , to remind you how country looked like th
And you might not know , because American media didn &apos;t show this , but in the hand of the mass of the women again you &apos;ve gone on the street . Yeah ?
HT : Yes . PM : Can we tell you about this ?
HT : 41 years of the moment of the momentum of the service , we can come up with the best place in the world to be a woman , but our job didn &apos;t .
So this way , in 14.38 , women in Iceland have a job , because that &apos;s what they &apos;ve done in this time that they &apos;ve made his days .
( Applause ) So , the truth was that the little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little little girl

So in fact , I &apos;m trying to think about your career of those teams as I &apos;m home , and I &apos;m the best example that I &apos;m supposed to do is a favor in The New
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Dad , if I &apos;m growing up , I want to be an extraordinary . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;ve had a major bland line , bec
I &apos;m not just about 50 people in America , but we &apos;ve been with my wife with more than 145 countries .
We &apos;re not just seeing with the cathedral of the president , but also we &apos;re going to get a village that lives in the most part of Africa .
It &apos;s kind of the minds of human rights , and by knowing how to know him , I could say without the two-wheeler , which is so often close to the eye , and that &apos;
There are a few reasons why I &apos;m guessed .
So , it &apos;s an important thing that you &apos;ve seen , these are the kinds of religious writing , the holy of writing , in Bruno , South West , New Zealand , Koran 
They &apos;re going to brow these ground to convince that women are average from their friend &apos;s leadership , compared to men in the bug of God .
About a year ago , in 2,000 years , I was a bippies , southwellers for 70 years — I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a lot of school &apos;
So , they &apos;ve given us a story that &apos;s essentially transmitting women to be holy , constantly , difficulties in the body , or holy in the artists , if the woman appreciates the classroom in
But the essence of this is that the writing areas are something that they &apos;re going to have in more high-tech .
That &apos;s the problem , because men can live the power , for example , that if you &apos;re a husband &apos;s husband or a job , you want to get women .
Why do I have to pay them the same way that they &apos;re going to work ?
It &apos;s a problem that &apos;s going to produce this problem that you &apos;re going to see that this problem is that we &apos;re going to see this problem that &apos;
In the U.S. , for example , we &apos;ve had a very big picture of the poor , mostly dark by people and menelves that were planted in themselves .
One of the thousand Americans was in prison .
Now , 7.3 people with 1,000 knowledge in prisons .
It &apos;s about seven .
By the time I &apos;m going to get a road of the British house , I have been able to have 800 percent of the darkness women in the prisons .
We &apos;re one of the world &apos;s countries on Earth , which are still made of the rate of the world &apos;s nation , which has to do with the country of the country .
We &apos;re going to have a place in one gray of countries , which are the most patients of the world &apos;s most patient .
We &apos;re now in California , and I learned a day that it was about four billion dollars of judgment on a 13 person to the rather than anyone .
They &apos;re going to be able to get a human being on the verge of the human being .
It &apos;s been kind of taken by the laws that have been taken by the number of people who have been able to get away from the poor and the wildlife of the world &apos;
I &apos;m going to be pretty brief .
It &apos;s kind of picked up with them .
But in some countries , in many countries , if you are growing a girl , quickly in her life , it &apos;s a genetic that &apos;s going to be expressed by this kind of answer that h
One of the things that you &apos;re going to see in more of the extraordinary scenarios .
And then , when she &apos;s getting out of this sort of thing , you can &apos;t have sex with sex .
It doesn &apos;t rule out , although it &apos;s against the law .
Empire , for example , 91 percent of all women who live in the Empire today , have been sexual desire to take this way .
In some countries , it &apos;s more than 98 percent of women , and they &apos;re trying to start .
That &apos;s difficult for all women who live in those countries .
And this is a very serious thing — where the family of the claim , there &apos;s nothing in Karan , which is that it &apos;s a little little little little little girl with your family , when she
It &apos;s done by the family of your family , so family becomes when you &apos;re given a girl &apos;s shame in your family .
It &apos;s not that we &apos;ve been testing these nations , and it &apos;s been shown that 75 percent of those kinds of girls are given to their parents , and you &apos;ve
The best problem , which exists in the world where to women — this is slavery , or the people of people like this are called now .
On the last 12.5 million person were embarrassed in the New York City in 19 and in 18 out of the world .
30 million person live today in slavery .
It &apos;s rust that the U.S. has been able to show up every single year , and rusted by the show of show , throughout their lives every year , 80 percent of those detailed —
In the United States , in this moment , 60,000 person lived under their brains or in slavery .
The Atlanta , Jordan , where lies of Contras Carotra and where I &apos;m talking to U.S. Europe , between 200 and 300 women , people who were looking at .
That &apos;s the place number one in the country of this .
The Atlanta lies like a lot of friends .
If you &apos;re going to see the barrier of the girl &apos;s little girl &apos;s little girl who has a favor , they can do this over 1,000 dollars .
So here &apos;s a girl &apos;s girl &apos;s girl &apos;s girl that &apos;s going to get a little bit of a barrier in Atlanta , and it &apos;s about 35,000 d
Six-anar in Atlanta , Georgia .
So that &apos;s still one very serious problem , because there &apos;s no barriers in America , you have a local smoke , or an unlike smoke .
That &apos;s talking to one of the biggest problems , women are given and getting into all the countries of the world .
And Sweden has a very good approach to this .
Twenty-five years ago , Sweden decided to change laws , and women are no longer going to leave the legislation , if they know in sexual slavery , but the barriers of the barrier , and that &
In the United States , you &apos;re going to see that you &apos;re going to see that you &apos;re going to have the United States .
On each other , to describe 25 women were arranged in the U.S.
Canada , Irish , I &apos;ve already said Sweden , France and the other country come now to this .
That &apos;s the other one , which can be built .
We have two high schools in the country , our archives and the extraordinary universe .
It &apos;s kind of better .
I &apos;d like to tell you that I &apos;ve given up , says that what happened was 26,000 .
Imagine 3,000 , nothing more than one of them , and the reason is that the business of any organization is made as much as my floating boat , or an eye in Marian fifth , and their rights have ri
The law needs to be changing .
It &apos;s going to be sexually because of my books , it now has a lot of consequences , partly because of my books , but because of other things , so 89 colleag
Now , the way that you say that you &apos;re going to know that you &apos;re going to know that they &apos;re beyond when they &apos;re using someone , but if they &apos
They don &apos;t leave .
That &apos;s the things that happen in our society .
It &apos;s very serious that it &apos;s very serious that you &apos;re going to know that it &apos;s like , you know . ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s sometimes you &apos;ve se
If I &apos;m the president of the world , it was 39 percent .
So we &apos;ve given each progress , and so on — ( Applause ) ( Laughter ) — but over the last 15 years , there was only about 23 or 24 percent in the last 15 years .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on right now .
When we take 500 companies , in 23 of their women , with 500 , and these leaders , I &apos;ll tell you , you &apos;ve been on average less than the other leaders .
That &apos;s what happens in our country .
And I &apos;m one of the problems that we &apos;re going to do with this problem that we &apos;re the very largest country on Earth .
We &apos;re in a state of II example of World War II .
There &apos;s been a lot of people in this room .
You &apos;re going to see this together , we &apos;ve been destructed by the bombsight , and we &apos;re looking at people .
One of the things , of course , now we have drones .
We were in the state of the II with 25 different countries or more after World War II .
For the years , I &apos;m not going to say anything , we &apos;re not vulnerable — ( Applause ) — we didn &apos;t have any bomb , we didn &apos;t have passed .
But in any case , those things that are given to the violence and the area of the holy are the core reasons of violence against women .
And I &apos;m one of the ones that I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to give you one of the biggest things , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m j
( Applause ) That &apos;s true .
It &apos;s a terrifying man who can say : certainly accepting a privileged condition , it &apos;s really like a little bit like when I was a baby , when Department and the darkness .
Remember of 1865 , position II between the birthday of the II , when Lindan John didn &apos;t tell the legal rights of the rights .
But for that time , there was a lot of white people who didn &apos;t think that discrimination is accepted , but they &apos;re silent , because that &apos;s used by privile
Now , when they say , &quot; &quot; I am against discrimination they &apos;re using a privileged condition .
So , most of the men who are made of money , most of the men , most of the men , most of the men , most men who are put in the world , and most men who ar

I would have said the best thing that we could do for women with some countries like this , and you &apos;ve given you a birthday , the Europe and so forth , who have a prof

When I was a student here in Oxf course in the 1970s , the world seemed to be the world .
Growth of the population was not to stop .
The universe was incomplete .
It &apos;s a cancer cancer , a challenge , because it &apos;s going to say that we &apos;re going to get our own lives .
That &apos;s the rail of the rain for the forests .
It &apos;s because you &apos;ve got a lot of time , and you &apos;re going to see that in a way that you &apos;re going to see this .
Now you don &apos;t have any of this . ( Laughter ) And that &apos;s what happened to the soul of the population on average on a human being on the planet , in the real expressions of the world .
It &apos;s been 30 percent of your life at 30 percent .
It &apos;s been the childhood that &apos;s been made for two third .
The food of food on the soul population has grown a shit .
But the single favelas that has become more blame , because they &apos;re getting into copying ?
There &apos;s a little bit of a population of a population of the population , and this graph shows GDP on the soul of the population .
The answer to this question is , you have to figure out how human beings are about their own intelligence , and you &apos;re going to give you an idea of what they &apos;re doing , 
And yet , you &apos;ve got to figure out how to get sex .
I want you to imagine what the way we &apos;ve gone from creating this kind of generation of finding .
It &apos;s about 30,000 generations .
And of course , there were and some changes , but the device changes the skeleton in the hours of the hours .
That &apos;s a military phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
So at the time , the time I &apos;m going to talk about the effects on the right , there &apos;s been about five years .
It &apos;s sort of the difference that you &apos;re sort of interested in .
It &apos;s kind of different materials from very different materials from syndrome and metal to the plastics .
And , more than that , with a mix of different ideas are the ideas of plists , the honor of the laser , the honor of transcript .
They were describing together in this technology .
And that &apos;s a combination , it &apos;s a certain technology that &apos;s given me . Because , I think , that &apos;s the key to understanding what &apos;s going on in the world .
My body is also the idea of the idea : the idea of boring cells , the idea of brain cells , the idea of printing .
They picked up together .
How is it something that &apos;s going to become something that &apos;s going to become something that &apos;s something that &apos;s important ?
And she &apos;s used by the cancer of the world .
It &apos;s if you can still have two different mutations in a different way .
They &apos;re going to have to learn about survival .
We have a species of talking to the person &apos;s person &apos;s person &apos;s person &apos;s person who has given the decline in the decline of mutual mutations by different lines .
So , let &apos;s allow you to allow the guy to allow the genetic innovation of all the species .
That doesn &apos;t come its own way .
It &apos;s the same process of the cultural Revolution that has a biodiversity ?
And I think that the answer is that &apos;s a kind of thing that &apos;s going to happen in a way that you &apos;re going to play with one thing that &apos;s going on .
That &apos;s a very low-tech rice embodiment of rice .
It doesn &apos;t have done this .
Culture can survive without any of them .
It &apos;s a lot of as sexual culture .
It &apos;s a culture of companies , and the touch of culture .
They teach each other traders who are passing from their parents .
You &apos;re going to bring a little bit of rock .
But the difference is the difference .
It &apos;s given their biggest culture in different kinds of challenges .
Now , there &apos;s no idea of an idea .
So why is the life of life standards ?
The answer came from the David Cardard in 1817 .
I &apos;d like to share with you the version of the Camenta that he also claimed to be a vocabulary between the country .
The products are going on for four hours and getting there for three hours .
It &apos;s going to be an ancient for an hour and you &apos;ve got two hours for two hours .
The best of Adam &apos;s best in Adam &apos;s face , and you &apos;re seeing .
You &apos;re seeing that I &apos;m not thinking of you , I &apos;m not saying that I &apos;m not thinking about you . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot
And he can do this and you &apos;re seeing that there &apos;s a lot of young health care and you &apos;re seeing that you &apos;re seeing that you &apos;re se
I &apos;m going to give you two of these things , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on for two years , and we &apos;re going to give you two of them , and that &apos;
It &apos;s given to you a little bit of a moment to realize that it &apos;s given to the force of the momentum , and so on .
Adam and Oz was by a half of my time .
To try ourselves : how long do you have to work , and you &apos;re going to see the hours of the book .
Once you &apos;re going to see , you &apos;re going to have to go to a village .
How many of you have this call ? Do you have a lot of time .
How many of you right now have to work for an hour on an hour , when you &apos;re going to have a lot of difficulty in the U.K.
In the &apos; 50s , &apos; 50s , &apos; 50s . &quot; &quot; So in the &apos; 50s , &apos; 50s . &quot; &quot; So in the &apos; 50s , &apos; 50s . &quot; &quot
You &apos;re seven and a half seconds of your grocery store compared to 1950 .
I &apos;d like 15 minutes to get 15 minutes to think about the number of things that you &apos;ve seen on average .
You may have been able to work six hours to have a holy , which would have given an hour .
Let &apos;s go back to the image of the background and the computer we &apos;re doing with the question , &quot; &quot; Hot them done them and for whom ? &quot;
It &apos;s been taken for me to other people .
How many of you have had him ?
That &apos;s why ? That &apos;s why ? That &apos;s what you &apos;re doing ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) That &apos;s why ?
You know , I think millions .
I &apos;m going to make a computer think for me .
And this way works society .
That &apos;s what we &apos;ve been doing as a biodiversity .
There &apos;s been a lot of time , if you were listening , people literally working on you .
They did have his sort of little bit of father , and they did this , and they were doing their spiritual teachers , and everything in this way .
498 people didn &apos;t do his dinner .
But there &apos;s a contemporary tourist that &apos;s taken by Vera 498 person also become dinner .
They &apos;re in the business , the cafe , the rusty , and the crisis by the &quot; &quot; figure , &quot; &quot; and they prepared to give you an extraordinary food through an h
It &apos;s going to promote the standards of everyone .
In fact , there are other animals that deal with one on another .
So Moore &apos;s a classic example of that .
It &apos;s the answer to the ground .
In England , we don &apos;t drive away from the front of the cocaine .
( Applause ) When was this behavior ?
It &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
But in me there &apos;s no evidence of this .
There &apos;s been a little bit of food work .
It &apos;s a bit of men and women .
And the beauty of this system is that she &apos;s sort of thinking that it &apos;s going to favor a bank .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; Oh my God , &quot; &quot; he knows .
And the husband knows that he doesn &apos;t have to be able to figure out .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to have — to make sure that you &apos;re going to see this .
What they didn &apos;t do is that they didn &apos;t do that .
They were high-tech food .
They were very intelligent food .
But there &apos;s no way that they &apos;ve given them a little bit of work .
There &apos;s a little bit of a little bit of women .
It looks that women are put together with men .
Now , there &apos;s no way that we &apos;re talking about the groups , because there &apos;s no way that we &apos;ve been embarrassed by the number of New York City , and the
For example , in Cascas , there &apos;s been a place where you have been exposed to the local devices of the world .
They &apos;re always taken from local admission .
So the same gave that there &apos;s a modern picture of this version that was very far away .
If the person began to come out of the way that you &apos;ve got the proof that they &apos;re going to take them between groups .
It &apos;s given a decade in a decade of the land of the earth .
And this appears to be finding somewhere 80,000 years ago in Africa , where we see that that &apos;s what &apos;s happening , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen by the 
It &apos;s been like cancer , as it was worked out here , Oxf course , was about 200 miles away from the mycorrhiza of the Alzheimer &apos;s .
And that &apos;s the usual thing that groups of people started talking about .
And that &apos;s led to realize .
They &apos;ve got some of these things that look at these things like popular scheme , and as a result of some of the changes that are given to some of these things .
So what happens when you bring people from the contamination , from the opportunities and cancer ?
And the answer is that it doesn &apos;t just reach the rest of progress , but even can turn it into the opposite .
It &apos;s kind of like Tasman &apos;s disease .
It &apos;s been compared to people with a macro , they &apos;ve actually been reported .
Because the population of 4,000 people was not highly high to sustainable skills , they were able to tell their technology to their technology .
It didn &apos;t happen on Tarra &apos;s show .
It &apos;s something that Tyranny &apos;s Fauge from South America is far more nodes .
The Tasmanians were paid .
Let &apos;s start again to the image and wonder ourselves , not just who did it and for whom , but who knew how to do it ?
No one , literally nobody .
So , the guidel of the collection of the community knows that they didn &apos;t know what they didn &apos;t know , and that &apos;s what it doesn &apos;t know .
I &apos;m of course , of course , of the paid , of course , a famous Europe of Rode , the 1950s , called &quot; &quot; I , Alvic , &quot; &quot; which he &apos
So what we did in modern society , the path of sharing and to realize — we &apos;ve created the opportunity to do things that we don &apos;t even realize .
That &apos;s not the same thing that &apos;s in language .
But to help the technologies of the technology .
By the way , I &apos;m not curious about the level of intelligence , or giving them a more high I.Q. than other groups .
That &apos;s absolutely not my value .
In society has a matter of how good people leave their own ideas , and how well they are , not something that &apos;s kind of intelligent .
We &apos;ve created a colleague brain .
We &apos;re just nodes in the networks .
We are the neurons of this brain .
It &apos;s the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea is that one of the rights of the world &apos;s rights , and the grades , the step of the blood .
You don &apos;t have less , and it &apos;s bad things .
In the future , while we &apos;re going forward ahead , we &apos;re going to help the scientific things .
Let &apos;s take war , depression , natural cocolism .
Fear things look in this century , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure that because of the connections that you &apos;re going to be telling people , these are the opportunities of the ideas that are seeing and the kinds of things th
So that &apos;s where these kinds of kinds of stuff that happens , and that &apos;s because they &apos;re going to have these kinds of ideas .
Thank you .
