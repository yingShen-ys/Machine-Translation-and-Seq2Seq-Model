I &apos;m going to talk to you about some of the things I &apos;ve been talking about .
I &apos;ve been working on the technology technology .
And I &apos;m a little bit of a little bit of a little bit , and I &apos;m going to take it to the environment , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
And we &apos;ve got to look at the different things that we &apos;re going to do .
It &apos;s a little video of what we &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s a minute .
It &apos;s a little bit of fun .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s just — I &apos;m going to go through this feeling — I &apos;m just going to go through the part of the video that &apos;s video . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s called . ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
( Laughter ) That &apos;s not . ( Laughter )
Okay . ( Laughter )
It &apos;s the technology technology .
Oh , I &apos;d finished my sermon ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I see you . ( Laughter )
So I &apos;d like to leave you with what you &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s a few minutes after a few minutes . I &apos;m sure , if you &apos;re trying to make your body a little , that &apos;s going to change your life as a matter of fact .
And we &apos;re interested in the language of the language , particularly of other people &apos;s language .
It &apos;s interesting that it &apos;s kind of interesting to me : &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot
Announcer : That &apos;s where they get closer and closer to 10 points .
It &apos;s going to be the hand of the very lucky copies of the U.S. the U.S.
And then it &apos;s the prime minister — Yox . ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause )
We &apos;re napkin . We &apos;re bitten ourselves .
We &apos;re blind .
We &apos;re trying to look for the guy in our face .
And as you see , it &apos;s also animals , and people are doing the same .
It turns out that it &apos;s powerful , and it &apos;s unavoidable , and it &apos;s unavoidable .
And when we get to the power , we tend to complete the gestures of other people .
And so , if anyone &apos;s going to give us the power of power , we &apos;re trying to disengage , and we don &apos;t have the gestures , and we don &apos;t have the gestures .
So , we &apos;re going to have the power of it .
Do you know what I &apos;m familiar with ?
I &apos;ve found that MBA teachers are not going to have a lot of power .
And they &apos;re going to take some of them out of the room , when they go into the room , when they go into the room , they go into the room , and they &apos;re trying to do it .
They &apos;re going to place a couple of two other people who are sitting there .
They &apos;re going to be able to do that .
They &apos;re not going to be seen .
They &apos;re going to snap as they sit , and they &apos;re going to be able to get their hands up .
I &apos;ve had a couple of examples of what I &apos;d like to do .
The first is that it &apos;s not going to be fun .
It &apos;s going to be that it &apos;s going on .
So the women are actually more likely to be the ones that are more likely to be .
The women are feeling more vulnerable than they are , and that &apos;s not an extraordinary thing .
And it &apos;s not enough , and it &apos;s not enough .
And it &apos;s very important for these MBA students , because they &apos;re interacting with their work .
They &apos;re always going to be able to do the same schools , and they &apos;re always going to take care of them .
The person who gets ready at the same time , and women get different , and it turns out that it &apos;s connected to work , and it &apos;s connected to work .
So I started thinking about the solution , which is that the syncs are more active in the way that they &apos;re going on , and that &apos;s what they &apos;re doing .
So if they &apos;re going to make these videos , they &apos;re going to make their own work more activity , they &apos;re going to make it more efficient ?
It wasn &apos;t going to be the fact that it wasn &apos;t going to be true .
So if we &apos;re able to do it , we &apos;re able to make our sense of self-confidence , how can we feel more powerful in the change of change in behavior ?
And we know that our gestures and our memes are thinking about us and thinking about us , and there &apos;s a lot of pneumonia .
But the question that &apos;s interesting about us is that these gestures and the memes don &apos;t .
And we &apos;re also going to smile , and we &apos;re going to smile , and we &apos;re going to smile , and we &apos;re going to smile .
So it &apos;s going to be true .
It &apos;s about the power of power .
We &apos;re kind of tend to be able to make our sense of the power of power and the power , but when we &apos;re in power , we &apos;re able to make our own sense of power .
It doesn &apos;t change our minds as we know that our minds don &apos;t change our minds , but our minds don &apos;t change our minds .
What do I do when I look at the feeling of power , what do you think ?
I &apos;m from the ideas of physics and emotion , and I &apos;m going through the physics of the physics , and I &apos;m going to tell you the hormones . I &apos;m learning about hormones .
What is it that you think about the weakness of the weakness ?
And it &apos;s not quite remarkable , but it &apos;s not enough , but it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;s not surprising , but it &apos;
We say , &quot; &quot; Do you like , &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; we say , &quot; &quot
And so we &apos;re not allowed to be able to do it , and we don &apos;t want to be able to do it .
And they wanted to play a game that was a risk for risk .
It &apos;s about 60 percent , and it &apos;s about 60 percent . It &apos;s important that it &apos;s important .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re familiar with testosterone .
It &apos;s about 20 percent in the testosterone of the time , from the moment of the moment of time , from the moment of the moment of getting to the moment of our strengths , and 10 percent — and it &apos;s about 10 percent — it &apos;s about 10 percent .
It &apos;s going to happen to two minutes .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s about 25 percent of what &apos;s going on in the world &apos;s consortium , and it &apos;s 15 percent .
The two minutes are coming out of these different kinds of changes that our brains are more ambitious , more and more comfortable , or more or more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more or less .
It &apos;s all about us , and that &apos;s what ?
So , our wish is that we don &apos;t know how to think and how we feel , and that &apos;s not the only thing that &apos;s going to happen .
It changes the way we think about it .
And the question that &apos;s interesting about us is that we have a few minutes of power , and it &apos;s also going to change our lives .
It &apos;s a couple of minutes at this lab .
What do you have to do with the real world ?
Unfortunately , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting about us .
For example , these poses can be used to create social security in social security .
What if we &apos;re in charge of time ?
It &apos;s a lucifer &apos;s case for innovation .
They &apos;re all these school meetings .
It &apos;s going to work , and it &apos;s kind of a work of work , or it &apos;s a business interview .
And we thought , &quot; &quot; Well , it &apos;s kind of interesting that you &apos;re going to do it , because you &apos;ve got a lot of it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s kind of an experience .
So we &apos;ve learned our temple , and the media has a broad debate , and that &apos;s what the juciferism says : &quot; &quot; Well , what do we do when we &apos;re going to go to business ? &quot; &quot;
( Laughter ) And the idea is that we &apos;ve denied this idea . No , no , no . We &apos;ve never seen this .
You don &apos;t have to do that .
That &apos;s not your head .
It &apos;s for you .
What do you do before we start to start ? &quot; &quot; So , I &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot;
You &apos;re sitting there , and you &apos;re looking at the iPhone or the Android .
You &apos;re looking at your nerves , you &apos;re bending , you &apos;re up , you &apos;re up . You &apos;re actually going to have to do it . It &apos;s just like you &apos;re sitting on the road , and you &apos;re
That &apos;s what we wanted to eat .
The businessmen went from a lot of work to the lab , and then they went through a lot of work , and they went through a lot of work , and they went through a lot of work .
It &apos;s a five-minute look at the video .
And it &apos;s been taught that we don &apos;t use it to be able to take care of the impact of people who are noticing , and they &apos;re kind of visible to them , and they &apos;re looking at that , and that &apos;s how they look .
It &apos;s much more than it is to look at an unhealthy sadness in five minutes .
Nobody likes it .
Marian LaFran says , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t stop at the moment . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a human in the human cortex .
We &apos;ve been able to get them from a interview to see the results .
And then we &apos;ve shown four of these images .
They didn &apos;t care about our eyes , our eyes .
They didn &apos;t know how much of my wife was taking . &quot; &quot; And when we looked at the videos , they showed them , &quot; &quot; We want to take these things to work . &quot; &quot; And they &apos;d show them , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; We don &apos;t want to take them to work .
And they &apos;re more likely to say , &quot; &quot; Well , what &apos;s going on ?
That &apos;s not the way they are .
It &apos;s dependent upon the ones that they &apos;re using .
And we &apos;re also looking at other illustrations of the other , and so , what is the quality of that is , what is it right ?
How do they have the superiority ?
It didn &apos;t have any difference .
It &apos;s not the thing that &apos;s going on , and that &apos;s not what it &apos;s going on .
People were just showing their own sadness .
So they didn &apos;t have their own .
They &apos;ve shown their ideas , they &apos;ve shown them as their own .
It &apos;s going to make this difference .
And when I say , &quot; &quot; We &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; our mind , our mind , our behavior , our behavior , our behavior , &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a little seller ? &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going
And I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to suggest you &apos;re going to be able to sign up the real world . &quot; &quot; So I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think you &apos;
&quot; &quot; I &apos;m not .
I don &apos;t want to be able to do it , and I don &apos;t want to make any sense .
I don &apos;t want to be an artist .
I don &apos;t want to be in a place that doesn &apos;t happen to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be a place .
I &apos;m going to take these words very well , and I &apos;d like to talk to you about a little story , and I &apos;d like to talk to you a little bit about a little story .
At the age of 19 , I had a very heavy car .
It &apos;s been out of the car , and it &apos;s been out of the car .
I &apos;ve been surrounded by a couple of times .
I &apos;ve been in the middle of the real-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great
I &apos;ve been to the IQ , because I &apos;ve been known as a boy and a kid who &apos;s kind of like a child .
I &apos;ve been trying to go back to the college , and I &apos;ve tried to go back .
They said to me , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t end up with you .
It &apos;s a lot of what you &apos;re going to know , but it &apos;s not the arm . &quot; &quot; And I started with this , and I &apos;d like to argue with you , you know , you &apos;ve got this network of people that you &apos
I &apos;ve felt completely humidity .
I &apos;ve worked , I &apos;ve worked , I &apos;ve been working on it , and I &apos;ve been working .
I &apos;ve ended up with my arm .
I &apos;ve had to spend four years of my group friends , and I &apos;ve been an artist who &apos;s an artist who &apos;s an artist who &apos;s an artist , and I &apos;ve been a writer at the University of Prinston , and I &apos;
I &apos;ve been different .
I &apos;ve met about 20 minutes when I &apos;m talking about 20 minutes in Prinston .
It was the night before .
I &apos;m so scared by the morning , and I &apos;m so afraid to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to know . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to know . &quot; &quot
He &apos;s going to say , &quot; &quot; You will . &quot; &quot;
It &apos;s at the bottom .
You &apos;re going to get all the outdoors .
In fact , when you &apos;re in a new way , if you &apos;re afraid , you &apos;re afraid , and you &apos;re going to see , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s bought . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s just taken away .
It &apos;s really coming out of my hand . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve done it . &quot; &quot; I did .
Five years ago , I &apos;d like to read a high school battery . It &apos;s a few years , I &apos;m in Northwestern , I &apos;m working there , I &apos;m working there , I &apos;m working there , but I &apos;ve been working on
At the end of the first year I &apos;d been Harvard , he didn &apos;t speak once , he didn &apos;t speak once , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to give you a job . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know it . I &apos
And it &apos;s also been the case , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not my place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not my place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not
It &apos;s turned out to me that it &apos;s turned into me .
Because it &apos;s two things .
The first one was , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m not sure .
But he was feeling , and that was the feeling of my life .
And the second thing was I realized that it was right in the right place .
So , he could have been able to do it , and he could be able to do it .
And I said , &quot; &quot; No , it &apos;s full of you .
He &apos;s going to show you , he &apos;s going to show you , he &apos;s going to show her , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to be empowered , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to
It &apos;s changed .
I &apos;d like to tell you , I &apos;d like to tell you .
Help me as much as it is .
You &apos;d like to do it until you &apos;re thinking about what you &apos;re trying to do .
You know , I &apos;d like to ask you to do it .
It &apos;s going to lead to the huge changes .
Now , I &apos;m going to tell you about two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
It &apos;s just about two minutes before you &apos;re going to work . It &apos;s about two minutes , trying to do it . In the context , in the tide of the table , in the tide of the table , it &apos;s on the front of the table .
Do you want to do it .
Let &apos;s say you &apos;re going to have the best of your brain .
increase your testosterone . You &apos;ve cut your Fortranol .
&quot; &quot; I &apos;ve never been able to show them what I &apos;m looking for . &quot; &quot; So , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m going to show you . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t
Your vision is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to show them and show them ! &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going to show them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to show them . &quot; &quot; You &apos;re going
I &apos;d like to share with you , I want you to share with you , and you &apos;d like to divide it with the beginnings , because it &apos;s very simple .
It &apos;s not self-confidence . ( Laughter ) It &apos;s about sharing you with people , because people who are going to be able to benefit from that , they &apos;re not going to be technology and receptors , and they &apos;re people who don &apos;t have access to
You know , you &apos;ve got to do it with them , and they &apos;re able to use you .
Because in the alone , there are two dimensions of space in their bodies that can affect their lives .
Thank you .
( Applause )
We &apos;ve got a lot of patriages in the world .
It &apos;s the most part of their superpowers .
They &apos;re a great employee , which is , to be able to live , to live in order to live in order to live .
They &apos;ve come out of a lot of the land that they &apos;re having to get out of the country &apos;s face .
Kids are working with a heavy , honest and honest job that allows them to do all the raw stuff , but they don &apos;t get them to be able to do it .
In here , in Braille , it &apos;s going to be 90 percent — they &apos;re going to raise them .
It &apos;s a lot of the cataracts , and it &apos;s a lot of it , and it &apos;s going to be a lot of it , and it &apos;s not going to be able to do it , but it &apos;s not going to be able to do it .
Karrocesses are a few small-scale cars that are coming out of the ground , and they &apos;re going to be out of the ground , and you &apos;re going to see them , and they &apos;re going to take a little bit of it , and you &apos;re going to see
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve met with these experiments , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
I &apos;m an activist , and I &apos;m an activist , and I &apos;m talking about the issues of politics , politics and environment .
In 2007 , I &apos;ve transformed my job in the city of the city , in 2007 .
But that &apos;s when I &apos;ve been working on catalysts .
It took more attention to my work and my work , and to help them go to the center of the world and help them get their trust .
These days , they &apos;re very popular in the media and social media .
For example , I &apos;ve been working with this world , and I &apos;ve been working in this field .
I &apos;ve been a lot more than 200 in many of the cities , and I &apos;ve been on a lot of people in the world , and I &apos;ve been on a lot of people in the world .
I &apos;ve come to the East , and they &apos;re not just going to be , they &apos;re not just going to be in Braille .
I &apos;ve come up with the countries in the United States , in China , in China , in China , in Turkey , in Turkey , in the country .
And after that , I realized that more people had to be solved , because this was the big work .
And then I &apos;ve created a movement under the title of &quot; &quot; The Choice . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a movement that &apos;s been a great-great-great-great-great-great-great
Thank you .
( Applause )
So it &apos;s a very large-scale movement that &apos;s designed to help the cardiacists and the cardboardors and the cardiacs , and it &apos;s a great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-g
Kadadors , the stadiums , the stadiums , the padies , the massage therapists , massage therapists , the massage therapies and the health care providers .
And so , when I was in the janitor &apos;s prophet , it was given to them to be able to see the security villages , the unaccounted village , the hands , the oil and the city that we don &apos;t care about .
They &apos;re also getting different tools for corruption : ion-linked lenses , filaments and glugs .
They &apos;re going to be part of this great and large amount of time , and it &apos;s going to be part of this great amount of time .
&quot; &quot; The Croc my brother . &quot; &quot; Sao Paulo , Rio de Janeiro and Kalibita .
But when I &apos;m going to talk about a lot of people who are from Brazil , we &apos;ve created a Pmptic that &apos;s been available , and we &apos;ve created a Pmpton that &apos;s easy to do with it , and it &apos;s a
So , he would know that he was going to have to be wrong . . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be like to be . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be .
It &apos;s about 170 centimeters , and it &apos;s about 1,2th-rays , and over the next two decades , it &apos;s been diluted to the movement of the &quot; &quot; my Carrove . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s
They &apos;re going to be the people who are imprisoned , and they &apos;re going to be people who are imprisoned .
They knew that they could come up with a very strange idea that they could come up with their income and society .
Now , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the catalysts and the other invisible superheroes , and I &apos;m talking to you .
Try to see the world as a whole , and without the hunches , and you &apos;re all trying to see it all .
It doesn &apos;t want to say , it &apos;s more than 20 million catalysts in the world .
When you see one time , when you see someone , don &apos;t know them as a part of our society .
I &apos;m going to thank you for Mitosa , the organizational , the organizational , and I &apos;d like to thank you for the first time . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ) Thank you .

It &apos;s called the &quot; &quot; The Field of 5 &quot; &quot; in the 1990s , in the 1990s when the Supreme Court called the Fall-Sense Challenge , Ravin Meira , the leader of New York City .
It &apos;s been known as non-zero-sumness , but it &apos;s non-invasive , but the other types of other women , the other number of other women , the gears , the synapses and the U.N. and the U.N. , they &apos;re ready
It &apos;s been subscribed by the STB , and it &apos;s sub-explored by the STB .
But of course , in 1993 , the WorldWide didn &apos;t know that the world was bombarded .
And the last one was known to be able to see in the Nosi Air Force .
It &apos;s my father &apos;s side-by-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-
In 1983 , Pennsylvania , in Pittsburgh , I &apos;ve opened the world to the world , and I &apos;ve been looking at the world , and I &apos;ve been looking at the world , and I &apos;ve been looking at the world , and they &apos;re
After my age , my parents began to change .
And my father , who was a lot of the people who were very few of the people who were very few people who were very few people .
And I &apos;ve learned about this , and I &apos;ve learned about this : that people don &apos;t usually take a long time to understand that each one of us is not the same .
In every single religion , every single one of us , every single one of us , will be less likely to be able to get to the people who are in charge of their own lives , and they &apos;re less likely to get into their own lives .
And a few months ago , I was a few months ago , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to take a couple of weeks . &quot; &quot; A couple of weeks ago , they went to the police of the London in London .
And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you what I &apos;m going to do . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot;
We &apos;d come up with the Kashtton Authoration Police . We didn &apos;t know that it was in the STB-nine &apos;s hidden observer .
And my father &apos;s back to me , my father had to help me on my suitcase , and how he was going to get to the 30-million-graders .
And what I &apos;d like to do is , the last laugh that I &apos;ve been doing is the little nuptial light bulb , which is the result of what &apos;s going on . It &apos;s kind of fun to it , and it &apos;s kind of like me .
My wife said , &quot; &quot; Ibn &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; Ibn &quot; &quot; — he said , &quot; &quot; Huh . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do after a few years , but after a few years , I realized they were laughing at what they were laughing at .
They thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have a sense of my ancestry , &quot; &quot; they &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure . &quot; &quot; And they thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos
And the last time , these people have been known to be able to do the world &apos;s market with 1,700-graders , and they &apos;ve been known to be able to do a lot of people , and so they &apos;re going to be injured by six percent of the world &apos
I &apos;m going to take these people to myself , and I &apos;m going to take them to my mind , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do , and that &apos;s what I &apos
&quot; &quot; The &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m calling &quot; &quot; — &quot; &quot; I &apos;m calling . &quot; &quot;
We &apos;ve changed our age 20 times the age of age , and that &apos;s why I &apos;ve had this value for my children , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m going to have these values .
It &apos;s one of the other things that we can &apos;t help me feel like I &apos;m feeling close to myself .
As a new one , I &apos;ve been around the time for a while , and I &apos;ve been surrounded by children .
And I was going to be able to make my way to my parents to not be in the center of the world , and I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to make sure that you &apos;re not going to be in the center of the world , but it &apos;
So I &apos;d like to use a lot of my promise , and I &apos;d like to read a book , and I &apos;d be able to watch a game or play .
And so I &apos;d been in the world of social history , and I wasn &apos;t really prepared for the truth as someone like this , as someone who was growing up in the land phantomist family .
I &apos;m growing up in a space where people have been able to do things like iron and religion , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
So what did I have opened up my eyes ?
And one of my early experiments was time , one of my early experiments , from the time of the year 2000s , the time of the year 2000 .
And I &apos;ve been working at the National Institute of Medicine , where I &apos;ve been working at the University of Medicine , where I &apos;ve been working at the University of Medicine .
And so , the group I &apos;ve been in , and I &apos;ve been there , and I &apos;m not sure that there &apos;s a lot of it , and I &apos;m not an individual , as a person who &apos;s been in charge of the world &apos;s
We were the people who had a different way of life .
I &apos;ve learned that one of the children I &apos;ve been friends in the last few days , I &apos;ve learned that one of the children I &apos;ve been friends .
It &apos;s been over a couple of days , but it &apos;s not just a matter of fact that we don &apos;t have the mainframe between us .
I &apos;ve never been a friend of mine , and I &apos;m saying , I &apos;m sure , I &apos;m sure I &apos;m going to know that I &apos;m going to know that I &apos;m going to know the barny that I &apos;m going
And it &apos;s a more important thing , and it &apos;s been work that I &apos;ve found in the Besch Garden park in the Yunch Garden .
I &apos;ve been in people &apos;s ideas here with different faith and culture , and that &apos;s how I &apos;ve been able to do this with my experience .
I &apos;ve been taught that I have a great feeling of homosexuality , and I &apos;ve learned that all of the gloves have an impact .
And so , I &apos;ve been able to work with a lot of people in the audience , and by the way , I &apos;ve been able to have a lot of people who are the most likely to be in the world &apos;s most .
So I &apos;ve expanded . It &apos;s a kind of an ox that I don &apos;t want to take care of , and I &apos;d like to tell you that I don &apos;t want to take care of myself , and I don &apos;t want to do anything with myself
And I would be able to make the stereotypes that I &apos;d been working with this feeling that I &apos;d be able to teach me that I was a child .
I don &apos;t know how to be there , but I &apos;ve met a lot of what it &apos;s doing because of what &apos;s happening to the reasons why it doesn &apos;t have you .
And then he was &quot; &quot; The Daly Show . &quot; &quot; And the Connectic I &apos;ve got to be honest with myself , and he helped me to tell me that I had to be honest with myself , that the religious , religious and sexuality of people &apos;
In the moment I heard about Connectart , when I heard the horse , the word &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; I was given the word &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; in the moment .
And I &apos;ve come out of the place where I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a very long time , and it &apos;s not that much of the Saudi comedian , but it doesn &apos;t appear on me at my point .
And one day , I was an exploitation of my worldview , and my mother said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m going to get out of my life . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to get out of my lifetime .
My mother looked at me and looked at me with the eyes of the tired , and he looked at me and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to get people off . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m giving people what I &apos
I understood how much more I was in a moment in a moment .
Zak Ebrahim is not the fact that I &apos;m going to make it a real step-by-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-g
I changed when I started to start with my parents &apos; family , and when I started to start with my family , I changed .
Why did I take my self-confidence , and I &apos;d be able to do it , and I &apos;d be able to do it ? &quot; &quot; What do I do ? &quot; &quot; And what did I do ? &quot; &quot; What would I be like
It &apos;s just simple .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do with that , which is , maybe one of the things that &apos;s going to happen to me is that I &apos;m not fantasy , but I &apos;m not fantasy , and I &apos;ve never been fantasy .
In fact , I &apos;ve chosen to use my own experience of life as I &apos;m going to work with , and I &apos;d like to use it as a way to do it .
I &apos;m going to do this for the term &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; and
I &apos;m going to try to see the motions of my ancestry , the way I &apos;ve been able to do it in this kind of extraordinary period of time .
Just like what I &apos;m talking about , like the simple nuance of what I &apos;ve been talking about , and it &apos;s not that it doesn &apos;t have to go through the road , and it doesn &apos;t have to go through the road , and it &apos;s
I &apos;m not like my dad .
Thank you . ( Applause ) ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause ) Thank you . ( Applause )
You &apos;re in the morning !
Isn &apos;t that ?
They took the name of a step on them , but I wanted to ask you , I &apos;d like to ask anybody here , what &apos;s called &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; ?
Who &apos;s writing ? &quot; &quot; Who is it ? Well , it doesn &apos;t have a problem .
One day I &apos;d been sitting next to my friend , and I &apos;d like to eat the food .
I looked at the office and I said , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Do you have ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; Do you have ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
He looked at me and looked at me as he was thinking about the morning of the morning , and he looked at me and I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;d like to tell you that the word &quot; &quot; to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like
He said , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t know ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot;
He said , &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X-ray ! &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Frenchman &quot; &quot; is true .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , the idea is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do it . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &
He was good enough to talk to me . He said , &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s the most obvious girl in this world , I &apos;m not looking at it . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t look at it .
What does I say to say , &quot; &quot; Menu &quot; &quot; ?
It &apos;s both called &quot; &quot; Lebanon , &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s been to take your boy back , and it &apos;s kind of like the ignorance .
How did that look at this kind of consultation ?
I started thinking about me at the moment .
That &apos;s what I did .
That &apos;s really what the guy looks like .
They don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot;
Is it going to start with another else ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; Why can &apos;t it be different ? &quot; &quot; How do you think it &apos;s going to be different ? &quot; &quot; Why can &apos;t you start ? &quot; &quot;
How do we get here ?
But , as I &apos;m here , there &apos;s a lot of people here , and they &apos;re going to take a message to their own lives , and they &apos;re not just going to be able to do it , and they &apos;re not going to be able to do anything that &
Do I have to forget all of my civilization , ideas , of ideas , and I don &apos;t have to remember my entire civilization ?
We could have the best of children &apos;s children in the war .
I &apos;ve learned everything I &apos;ve learned in language .
Should I remember to be one of them ?
What did I do here ?
And so , I &apos;m trying to figure out if I &apos;m trying to figure it out .
I didn &apos;t want to be able to do it , and I didn &apos;t want to do it .
The idea is that the language doesn &apos;t respond to the students &apos;s students .
It &apos;s not the language we &apos;ve been able to do , but it &apos;s not the language that we &apos;ve been able to do to do a large amount of research where we &apos;re used in our universities , and that &apos;s not the language we &apos;re
If we did that , they would have left our palms .
I don &apos;t have to use my language ? We &apos;ve got to do it , we don &apos;t have to do it .
So , you know , we &apos;ve got to use the language language . We &apos;re not going to use it .
It &apos;s a reality .
But it &apos;s a more important thing that we don &apos;t think about .
The English language is the language language .
So in the research , you &apos;re not supposed to be able to be able to do it in other languages , but if you &apos;re not supposed to be able to do it in other languages , you &apos;re not supposed to be able to do it .
In the language of language , it &apos;s a good thing for us to do it in other languages .
Why ?
It &apos;s the first time when it &apos;s the first time when you first started writing .
It was the little boy in the village that had all of the ideas , the forces and the perfection , the little boy in the village .
So when he started to write in English , he had a lot of it .
In fact , when you &apos;re reading in English in English , you &apos;re feeling a lot of it , and you &apos;re going to have a feeling of that .
You know , you can imagine that it &apos;s in English , and it &apos;s coming from the leaders of the leaders .
It &apos;s a mission that no one is going to be .
The second one is that if you want to kill a mile , if you want to kill a mile , the only way to kill it is to kill its language .
It &apos;s a reality that &apos;s developed .
Galls , the flocks , the things , the ninces — these milliseconds &apos;re in the difference of this rhetoric .
And so , they &apos;re not allowed to protect their own language .
They &apos;re in the world .
So they &apos;re using language to do it , and they &apos;re going to pay for a lot of money to develop language .
What do we know more than that ?
Well , we &apos;re not going to have the world , we &apos;re not going to be able to do it , and we &apos;d like to get to the world , and we &apos;d like to get into the world .
It &apos;s a long time ago , and it &apos;s a very long time ago , and the countries of the world , the countries that are coming out of the country , and they &apos;re kind of like , &quot; &quot; Oh , they &apos;re not allowed to be able to do
They &apos;ve kept their language close to their own .
Because if you take a product from Turkey or another somewhere , and it doesn &apos;t have to be tagged on its own , it &apos;s not the indigenous product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it was the indigenous product .
They &apos;d be the same as the first one , and they &apos;re not quite pleasant as we &apos;re at the same time .
So they needed to be able to innovate and to make their own language .
What if I said , &quot; &quot; minority , water , &quot; &quot; is what &apos;s going to happen to you ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot;
It doesn &apos;t remember what it is , it &apos;s flat ?
No , we don &apos;t see how it is and why it is .
It &apos;s not the only way we &apos;re going to be able to do it , but it &apos;s not the tools that we &apos;re talking about .
Language is not only a terminology that &apos;s connected to our lives and our commanders .
And so , when we say , &quot; &quot; minority , water , &quot; &quot; in which every single one of you is alive , there &apos;s a lot of it , and there &apos;s a lot of it .
It &apos;s not one , two or three words or three words or anything .
It &apos;s an idea of how we think about how we see each other , how other people see us .
What is Intelace ?
You can say , &quot; &quot; Well , that &apos;s a person , &quot; &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Do you know ? &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; Why ? &quot; &quot; You say , &quot; &quot; Hey
So , if I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; minority , water , &quot; &quot; and if you &apos;re going to see if you &apos;re going to have your son , &quot; &quot; Well , if you &apos;re living in a minority ?
What does it feel ?
If you don &apos;t see the problem , I &apos;m going to go out and I &apos;m not talking to the empty place .
And that &apos;s what that means is that these phrases have something to do with us .
I &apos;ve got an ex-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-
And one day I asked him , &quot; &quot; How is it going to work ?
He said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; But I &apos;ve been working for one day to make the word &quot; &quot; for every night . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s like ,
And he &apos;d been , &quot; &quot; How do you make people feel so much ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How does human beings have this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How does human beings have this ? &quot; &quot; &quot
He wants to make suicide , he &apos;s asking for suicide ?
&quot; &quot; The press ? &quot; &quot; ( English ) &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a couple of missions .
And so we started thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , the woman can &apos;t help him . &quot; &quot; The women don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; Well , the woman can &apos;t tell him . &quot; &quot; It &apos;
My costume said to me , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve been listening to my Fairy and I &apos;m trying to make it for him . &quot; &quot; And the woman tried to do it for him , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos
Let &apos;s take this to me for me .
( Applause ) What did we do to protect the language language ?
We &apos;ve been able to do this , and we &apos;ve been camping in the way that we do this , and we &apos;ve been camping to protect the language language .
And so many people said to me , &quot; &quot; Why are you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why are you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why are you ? &quot; &quot; ?
It &apos;s about forgetting and for itself . &quot; &quot; You don &apos;t have the problem !
And this was the dawn of the preservation of the preservation camp , &quot; I &apos;m from the north of Shanghai , and you &apos;ll give me the answers to me . &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to respond to me . &quot;
We didn &apos;t say , &quot; &quot; Yox ! We don &apos;t have to do it or . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t choose this , because we didn &apos;t choose to do it in this way .
And when I &apos;m talking to me , I &apos;m going to talk to you about the language language .
We say , &quot; &quot; We want to change our reality , and we don &apos;t need our celebrities , our aspirations and our everyday lives .
It &apos;s like us , and it &apos;s like us , and it &apos;s kind of like us .
So he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from the north of Shanghai , but you &apos;re going to give me the answers to me . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; You know , you &apos;re going to respond to me . &quot; &
It &apos;s very simple , but it &apos;s also creative and meaningful .
And then we started another camp that was written every day after that .
You &apos;re seeing this , you &apos;re seeing , you &apos;re seeing , you &apos;ve got to see this in the flag , and you &apos;re not going to kill it , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill the language ! &quot; &quot; &
Why ? It &apos;s really , really , killing your language .
We &apos;re not going to kill our language .
If we were to kill our language , we needed to find our identity .
We had to tap into our existence .
We &apos;re going to go back to the beginning .
It &apos;s a serious issue with our chance to become a culture and a culture .
And then we spread the images of the boys and the girls .
&quot; &quot; Cool &quot; &quot; is the images of the girls and the boys .
We &apos;re very , &quot; &quot; hool &quot; &quot; !
And who said , &quot; &quot; Aha , you &apos;re in English ! &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying , &quot; &quot; Yox ! I &apos;m the word &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not
I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; Internet . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go into the world . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) Because that &apos;s why it &apos;
But we need to believe that we have to believe that if we &apos;re not the case , we &apos;re not going to be able to apply them to the bigger ones and the bigger things that we &apos;re going to do , and what they want to do with us , and what they want to us .
It &apos;s the idea of being creative .
If we can &apos;t fly into the universe , and if we don &apos;t know about the universe , and we can be creative .
But you &apos;re still a creative projection .
It &apos;s a very essence in your master &apos;s language .
Let &apos;s start with this moment .
Let &apos;s take a movie and take a movie .
It &apos;s just a novel that we can make the novel .
It &apos;s going to be a new way of talking about the language of the language .
So , &quot; &quot; There &apos;s no way there &apos;s no way . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not flat .
But we don &apos;t have to know and believe that it &apos;s a way to get out , and it &apos;s our debt .
So , as a matter of fact , what can you do today ?
Tavitars , who &apos;s going on ?
And even though I &apos;m going to do it , I &apos;d like to ask you to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to talk to you about it , &quot; &quot; in English , it &apos;s in English .
But don &apos;t write with the traffickings when I &apos;m writing in Arabic .
( Applause ) That &apos;s a flute ! That &apos;s not the language !
You &apos;re going to be familiar with the viral language of the viral language .
It &apos;s not easy to get out of a place like this .
It &apos;s the first job that we can do .
The second is there &apos;s a lot of other things that we can do .
We &apos;re not going to be able to get to believe in this day .
And we &apos;re here , we &apos;re able to get this language into the center of the protection .
Now , I &apos;m going to give you a hurry .
For the first time , he &apos;s familiar with his own ancestor .
And when I &apos;m born , I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the disaster , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not going to say , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what you do . &quot; &
( Applause ) So , we &apos;re able to do it . ( Applause )
And a few years ago , I was able to see the U.S. philosopher Morgan Spurlock , and I was looking at the moonlights .
I &apos;ve learned a couple of things when I &apos;ve got this 30-day test .
It &apos;s been a little more likely to be able to get to the point where the moonlights will go through the moon , and then it &apos;s going to be more likely to have been . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s a little more likely to be able to do it .
For example , I took a picture every single month in a month .
I &apos;d like to talk to you about 30 days ago .
I &apos;ve learned about it , and I &apos;ve learned about it .
By the way , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s going to have to say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s worthwhile .
But you &apos;re going to end the novel .
It &apos;s very bad .
I don &apos;t have to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a computer . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not the computer . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have
No , I can say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a writer . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m writing . &quot; &
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s very small , it &apos;s going to be , and I &apos;m going to do it , and I &apos;m going to make sure that it &apos;s going to be a long time .
In fact , they &apos;re very fun .
( Applause )
The first day I started working with hope and our optimization .
I &apos;d like to have a lot of attention to the school that I &apos;d like to take care of , and I &apos;ve started with a lot of a lot of the time , and the way it &apos;s going to work , and the way it &apos;s going to work .
It &apos;s actually been a very promising and very compelling image to the students who &apos;ve been able to talk about the problem .
And what I &apos;d like to do is , I &apos;ve been a lot of my self-confident , insecurities , but I &apos;m afraid I &apos;m afraid of the empty men that I &apos;m going to come from , and I &apos;m afraid I &
But I &apos;ve learned how to hide these conservatives well .
It &apos;s so compelling that it &apos;s so compelling that I &apos;ve had my essence , and I &apos;ve never been able to do it , when it &apos;s the first time , it &apos;s not even the beginning of the second .
So , as I did , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; As I &apos;ve been doing before I &apos;ve been , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , that &apos;s when I left . &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know who was in the side of the side .
It &apos;s going to be , you know , you &apos;re going to put it on the battery , and you &apos;re going to put it in your cell phone .
&quot; &quot; He &apos;s hungry . &quot; &quot; I was equal .
It &apos;s a beginning .
And I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to talk to you , &quot; &quot; and I &apos;d like to talk to you about a third of the time , and I &apos;d like to talk to you about a third of the people .
&quot; Oh , it &apos;s going to be important . &quot;
I &apos;d like to tell you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to give you a little bit of a while . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure this hide , I &apos;m not sure . &quot;
For example , I &apos;ve had a lot of my history and real feeling when I &apos;m in the way that I &apos;m going .
At the time , I didn &apos;t know anything , but I &apos;m feeling , I &apos;m feeling , I &apos;m not sure , but I &apos;m feeling that I &apos;m going to work on my commandments , and I &apos;m going to work on it .
I &apos;ve been talking about it , and it &apos;s coming down .
And it came up with this , and it &apos;s a very serious argument for me , and I &apos;m a serious postcard of my own . . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s a very serious poses . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;
It started to come up with a little bit of protection . I &apos;ve gone back to my second , and I &apos;ve sent a second to my second-largest magazine .
I &apos;ve got the idea that I &apos;m taking my arm .
And what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;ve heard about my self-confidence , and I &apos;ve seen that I &apos;ve been listening to my mind , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
I &apos;ve got this curiosity , I need to help , and I &apos;ve started to talk to him about it , and I &apos;ve started talking about it .
So , I &apos;d like to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to tell you what you &apos;re doing . &quot; &quot
I &apos;d been in the Psychiatry , and I &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to do it , &quot; &quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to do everything . &quot; &quot;
For example , I &apos;d like to work as a doctor of campers , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to go , I &apos;m going to go , I &apos;m going to go . &quot; &quot; I &
I &apos;ve got to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to have to say , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to have a book . &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot;
And then he began to get out of my time , and he began to get out of my body .
I &apos;d like to believe that , after I &apos;m standing on the floor , he &apos;s put in schizophrenia , and then he &apos;s the most important thing , and then he &apos;s got a sense of self-awareness , and he &apos;s kind of a sense
And I &apos;ve been in the fear and my mum , because I &apos;m convinced that I &apos;m not an artist , it &apos;s not an experience of life , but it &apos;s not the kind of thing that I &apos;m talking about .
It &apos;s a kind of pseudication , it &apos;s a kind of psex , and it &apos;s starting to look at the sound of the sound , and it &apos;s starting to slow down , and it &apos;s going down and down , and it &apos;
I &apos;ve been in a very similar way , and I &apos;ve been a little bit more like this , and it &apos;s a kind of like this , and I &apos;m going to push my way through my world , and I &apos;d like to push my way through my world .
For example , if I can &apos;t help them , they &apos;re going to change my life , they &apos;re going to change my life , and that &apos;s how they &apos;re starting to put together these kinds of tapirs .
They &apos;re the first temes that I &apos;d like to take for granted , like a three-by-step , and then they &apos;re more inclusive , and they &apos;re also dramatic , and they &apos;re also particularly dramatic tap : &quot; &quot; Do you see
Do you see the style of water in inside ?
And it &apos;s going to the press , and I &apos;ve been doing this water , and I &apos;ve been doing it , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do , and that &apos;s what it &apos;s lightning .
I wasn &apos;t the case of the fear , the protection , the unacceptable and unhealthy , unhealthy and understood . I wasn &apos;t in this shower in this shower that I was feeling weak .
Two years later , my memory started to get worse .
I &apos;ve been in the media of the whole village : the sad sound , it &apos;s kind of cool , it &apos;s kind of weird , it &apos;s not worth it , it &apos;s not worth it , but it &apos;s not worth it , it &apos;s
I &apos;ve been a catalyst , a catalysis , a traditional , traditional and sexive , physical and sexal cell , and my pxicillin , he &apos;s going to be more comfortable than that schizophrenia . &quot; &quot; And he &apos;s been put in the
Now , I &apos;ve been thinking , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to show you that I &apos;m dead . &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s dead .
It &apos;s been sent to a high school journey , and it &apos;s not going to get out of the journey , and it &apos;s not going to go back to the stage , and it &apos;s going to go back to one person I &apos;ve got to get up .
I &apos;ve been a lot of people , and they &apos;re all going to me , and they &apos;re all around them , but they &apos;re very weak and left to me , and they &apos;re very weak and left-helded than the people who have helped me .
I &apos;ve had my friends and I , and I &apos;ve had a lot of my friends , and I &apos;m going to look at it , and I &apos;m going to look at it , and I &apos;m going to look at it , and I &apos;ve been working with
I &apos;m sure that Eleanor is going to do that .
If it &apos;s raining at some point , it &apos;s all coming out of it . &quot; &quot; And I don &apos;t want to thank you for me , and I don &apos;t have to thank these beautiful people that I &apos;ve been able to go back to this
But they &apos;re in a way that they &apos;re going into the world , and they &apos;re going into the health of the spirit .
I said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m saying they &apos;re actually celebrating me , and the last thing is that I &apos;m not always going to deal with anything I &apos;ve ever done , but I &apos;m not sure that I don &apos;t start
It was hard to believe that before the sound was slowing down and working , I &apos;ve never had to learn how to do it , and I &apos;ve never been able to learn how to do it as I am , and I &apos;ve never been able to learn how to do it .
I &apos;ve learned that it &apos;s not like the sounds that I &apos;ve been able to do with my home , and it &apos;s not like the sounds that I &apos;m able to do with my home , but the fear and the security that I feel .
I &apos;d like to ask them , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to believe them .
I &apos;m sitting at one night , I &apos;m sitting in my parents &apos; voices , and I &apos;m going to protect them from the sounds that I &apos;ve been able to do with the sound that I &apos;m doing .
I &apos;ve got a lot of pain in the house because there &apos;s a lot of attention to it , it &apos;s been hidden in the room , and it &apos;s going on in the room , and it &apos;s a bad thing , and it &apos;s a bad thing .
The idea is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to work with me .
And I didn &apos;t see if there was a plastic piece of plastic ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about .
And then , I &apos;ve been able to make a lot more important than the words of the word &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been able to make a lot more important . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been putting
And I started to respond to the stories , and I started to respond to them , but I started to answer them , and I started to start with my story , and I started to start with my story , and I started to start with my own . &quot; &quot; So , I started to learn how to do it .
And I &apos;ve learned that every single one and every single one of the other things that I &apos;ve never been able to do at the time , I &apos;ve learned that there &apos;s a little bit of a sense of how much of it , that I &apos;ve never been able to work
They &apos;re all the way that these wounds , and they &apos;ve been translated into the words , and I &apos;ve discovered that the sounds that are most likely to be the most , and most of the humility , and I &apos;ve discovered that the sounds that most of the sound are the most
And after the first time , what I was trying to do was , what I was doing was , I &apos;ve been able to do it in a different way that I &apos;m going to go from the bottom-up of the tide of the tide , which is that I &apos;ve been able to go
After the first time , 10 years after I was the first time , I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;ve got the most high school in the university history , and I &apos;ve been , I &apos;ve got the most loyalty , and I &apos;ve got the most loyal
And one of the things I &apos;d like to tell you is , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to tell you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) And one of the things that I &apos;d like to tell you is , I &apos;d like to
And I &apos;m going to say , I &apos;m going to use it , and I &apos;m going to use it , and I &apos;m going to use it , and I &apos;m going to use it , and I &apos;m going to use it , and I &apos;
It &apos;s as if it &apos;s what Osmar &apos;s Taylavil , and he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to ask you to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot
We don &apos;t know about two stories at the same time .
I &apos;ve been working on a very strong health , and I &apos;ve been studying books , and I &apos;m going on , and I &apos;m going to try to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you to ask the question , &quot; &quot
And I &apos;ve learned how to live with them , and I &apos;ve learned to live with them , and I &apos;ve learned to live with them , and I &apos;ve learned that they &apos;re a feeling of suffering and education .
And I could help other women , as I could , a woman who was most effective than the sound of the most effective sound .
But it &apos;s still — it &apos;s a very long way to say that we &apos;ve been able to do the work of Intervalucius , which is the fact that we &apos;re going to work with a lot of people who are in the world &apos;s office and Dr.
It &apos;s a very , really important thing for us to share and understand the need for women , and to tell them that they need to be a full-knowledge , and what they need to do with them , and what they need to do with them , and to tell them , &quot; &quot; Yes .
That &apos;s the kind of society that &apos;s possible , and it &apos;s about building up .
And there &apos;s a lot of it , there &apos;s no such thing as if social change is starting to start .
It &apos;s not going to be taken away .
It &apos;s not going to be the people who don &apos;t get scared .
For me , what I &apos;m saying is that the wisdom of the Cities and the world is not just the words , but it &apos;s not just that there &apos;s no such thing to change and to change the world , and it &apos;s not going to change the world , it &apos;
In the last 20 years , it &apos;s been spread across five countries and 26 countries , and it &apos;s expanding the opportunities of people who are working hard hard to work , and a lot of people , and a lot of people who have a lot of effort , and we &apos;re going to have a lot of
It &apos;s an organic existence , which is a kind of neglectal , which is the equivalent of a human being , which is the equivalent of the people of the human rights .
And I &apos;m looking at this , the greatest mountain of our society , to be able to get to the health of someone who needs to health , is to be able to cut , to cut , to divide and to be able to do it .
We don &apos;t have to be able to remember that we have to remember , and we don &apos;t have to remember .
We &apos;re not similar . We &apos;re not .
It &apos;s not going to be to take out what we &apos;re in , and it &apos;s not a leopard .
It &apos;s not going off .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not talking about what others say when you &apos;re barking .
He &apos;s talking about it . &quot; &quot; Thank you very much .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to talk to you about my photographer .
But that &apos;s the photometer ?
Because , of course , it &apos;s not a photograph you can take with your camera .
And then , I was my mummage , my first photograph of a 15-year-old first photo . &quot; &quot; So , I &apos;d like to take my first photo .
I &apos;ve been working with my mismatch , but it &apos;s a slightly different way , because it &apos;s the process that I &apos;m using from the camera .
And when you &apos;ve taken a photo of photons , it &apos;s ready when it &apos;s printed , when it &apos;s printed .
For me , the photography was not just the right place to be in the right place .
I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do that . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to do that . &quot; &quot; And I thought , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going
So I wanted to make something different to this , and it &apos;s something that it &apos;s starting to work after .
It &apos;s like this : It &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s going on in a way that &apos;s going on .
But it &apos;s an unimaginable game .
And it &apos;s really close to the truth .
Or the pictures like this — and it &apos;s also dark , dark , colorful , but it &apos;s all about the protection of reality .
So , when I &apos;m thinking about it , I &apos;m looking at the photo-realism .
Because , of course , they &apos;re not the pictures we &apos;re going to really do , but I &apos;d like to be able to take a camera out of the camera .
I &apos;d like to ask you to have a little bit of a sense of what you &apos;re going to have to think about .
So it &apos;s not really going to be able to do it , but it &apos;s really important to keep it right .
What does it mean by the fact that it &apos;s true of the fact that it &apos;s true ?
And if it doesn &apos;t have to do with these details , it &apos;s got to be colorful .
Do you think it &apos;s okay ?
What &apos;s the nature of ?
Sometimes it &apos;s the kind of person who &apos;s created .
But at the end , how do we deal with the world , the two-dimensional in the two-by-a-half morning ?
It &apos;s not really what &apos;s happening in reality , but it &apos;s really what &apos;s happening to us .
So it &apos;s the basic idea that it &apos;s simple .
I &apos;m seeing this in the real world , and I &apos;m going to make it work , and I &apos;m going to make it work in real time .
I &apos;m just showing you one .
There &apos;s a lot of physics that you can see , three-dimensional , and three-dimensional , and it &apos;s based on the three-dimensional world .
But in a way , it &apos;s kind of like the three-dimensional objects that have been there .
Now , you know , it &apos;s not possible that it can &apos;t exist .
So we &apos;re playing with our brains , because our brains can &apos;t help but do not exist .
And I &apos;m seeing the same process , and I &apos;m seeing .
It &apos;s really important to make different truths .
So what we &apos;re seeing is a picture of a photograph , the things that we don &apos;t think about , our everyday lives , the things that are around us .
And the pictures are really important , and it &apos;s really important to get it out , because it &apos;s kind of like the wrong thing .
So what I want to say is , there are three simple laws that we should not have to do to do something real .
As you see , it doesn &apos;t have a particular part of these images .
But it &apos;s in a way , it &apos;s something that &apos;s going on .
So in the first place in the first place , the individualists have to be the same .
The second is , it &apos;s got to be the same as the light that &apos;s going on .
And in these two ways , these two two things — it &apos;s taken from the same mass , and it &apos;s taken away from the same light .
And the third is that it &apos;s kind of a huge budget , and it &apos;s not going to be done , but it &apos;s not going to be done , it &apos;s not going to be able to do it , but it &apos;s not going to be able to do it .
It &apos;s got to be something that you can &apos;t see how it &apos;s created .
And we &apos;ve been able to make the difference between different images of the land , the location , the location and the glimps of the field , and we &apos;ve been able to make the difference between the different images and the different images of the field , and it &apos;s not just a hundredth of
Here &apos;s another thing .
( Laughter ) People can imagine that it &apos;s true , and it &apos;s the bottom line .
But it &apos;s actually happening , and it &apos;s a completely different kind of picture of the pictures of different places .
I think it &apos;s easier for me to make a place , and it &apos;s easier for you to change your ideas if you &apos;re less likely to change your ideas .
But that &apos;s a lot of planning .
And I knew I had a couple of months to find the different places to find the different places in which the temple of tapiracy came in .
For example , the fish of the fish , it &apos;s taken away .
It &apos;s a different way to do it .
It &apos;s a piece of water , and it &apos;s a piece of water that &apos;s going on .
And so , I &apos;ve been painting the house for the island of the island , the more Sweden , the more Sweden .
So it &apos;s possible for the truth to be able to do it , and it &apos;s possible for planning .
It &apos;s always going to start with an idea .
Then it &apos;s going to make different pictures of the different pictures .
In this way , every single piece is a very well-support .
And you &apos;ve got the pictures good , and it &apos;s really hard to be able to do it , and it &apos;s really real .
So there &apos;s all the data that we need , and it &apos;s the only thing that we need , and the only thing that we need is our ability .
Thank you .
( Applause )
Chris Anderson : Julian , you &apos;re happy .
It &apos;s given this information , and it &apos;s been more information than the information that the world &apos;s world has published in the last few years .
Is this possible ?
Julian Asendment : Yes , that &apos;s the right thing ?
It &apos;s not about how bad the world &apos;s world is going to work ? It &apos;s a small activist , and it &apos;s going to spread more information than all the world &apos;s world .
CA : How do you do that ?
How do people emit these artists ?
How do you protect the laws of medicine ?
JA : As much as we know , it &apos;s a lot of information that we know , and there are different ways of getting information to get to us .
It &apos;s encrypting information , it &apos;s encrypted , it &apos;s encrypted , it &apos;s going to be in the Internet , and it &apos;s going to be in the country , and it &apos;s going to be in the country as Sweden and Chicago .
It &apos;s kind of encrypted , and it &apos;s kind of like it , and it &apos;s kind of like a bad news , it &apos;s kind of hard to do — it &apos;s going to be a little hard to do — it &apos;s open , it &apos
CA : That &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to do . It &apos;s not a lot of the data , but you don &apos;t know who &apos;s going on , and you don &apos;t know who &apos;s going on .
JA : It &apos;s true . We &apos;re rare .
( Video ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s Zi .
( Laughter ) CA : I think I &apos;d like to ask you , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to ask you the code of TED . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ) CA : I &apos
Now , let &apos;s look at the municipalities .
It &apos;s the information that &apos;s just a few years ago .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;re looking for .
It was a story of Kenya .
How do you talk about this story ?
JA : That &apos;s Kroll Report .
After 2004 , after the election of 2004 , it was done by the government of Kenya .
In Kenya , for 18 years , Kenya has been ruled by Daniel Rapi Modi .
That &apos;s a dictatorship in Kenya .
And when they started with the power of government with the power of the government , they &apos;d be able to take two million pounds of account for this one .
And the government &apos;s been used as a political force in Kenya , which is the most important person in Kenya , and it &apos;s now a political force that &apos;s the most capable of ever .
It &apos;s kind of like the book of the Kenyan Museum of Modernism .
In 2007 , in 2007 , I was able to go to Kenya , and I could get art .
And this was the question that we published it after three days after he was starting to get to close to the guy who was starting to be close to the money that he started to get to the money of his newborn Dianie Daniel Dianel , and after this event , he got the account of his account .
CA : The long word &quot; &quot; a long word &quot; &quot; is not the Kenya of Kenya , and it &apos;s been brought up by roads , and you think , it &apos;s changed the election of the election .
JA : It &apos;s okay . It &apos;s in the capital of the Guardian , and then it &apos;s in the countries around the country , Tanzania and Candibi .
It &apos;s coming out of the news .
For a few days , Kenya has started writing about the subject .
It &apos;s been published in Kenya as 20 days , and Kenya has changed 10 percent of the journey to the account of security , and it &apos;s also caused by the way that we do it .
CA : So the information that you &apos;re levered in is actually changing the world ?
JA : Yes .
( Applause ) CA : This time , there &apos;s a video of the air cell in the Baghdad .
It &apos;s a little bit taller . It &apos;s in the eye .
I &apos;m just saying , there &apos;s a little bit of violence in this video .
Radio : It &apos;s fair , it &apos;s just going on .
Now , it looks like it &apos;s in the X-ray .
It &apos;s the moon . It &apos;s the moon .
It &apos;s when you see it . It &apos;s up .
It &apos;s beating .
The moon is the ancestor !
( Video ) ( Video ) ( Applause ) Dam , it &apos;s going . It &apos;s going on .
The hotel ... Bashmaster Two-Six , Bashmaster Two-Six .
It had to take off , now ! &quot; &quot; Now ! &quot; &quot; Now ! &quot; &quot; Now ! &quot; &quot; Now ! &quot; &quot; Now ! &quot; &quot; Now ! &quot; &quot; Now ! &quot; &quot
It &apos;s happened , we killed eight percent of the time .
There &apos;s two data , we &apos;re going on .
It &apos;s happened . It &apos;s dead .
Two-Six , we &apos;re moving to the Two-Six .
Oops . It &apos;s going on . It &apos;s what it &apos;s like .
It &apos;s possible . It &apos;s the way it &apos;s done . It &apos;s hard . It &apos;s done .
CA : How did this video affect the impact of this video ?
JA : It &apos;s heavy for people who have been working on this work .
It &apos;s been transferred in the Baghda to study this video .
It &apos;s actually one of the three cells in the video .
CA : I don &apos;t say , if I don &apos;t say , it &apos;s about 11 o &apos;clock , when the Reuters have died , they &apos;re dead .
JA : Yes . Two Reuters died , two children were injured .
In the case , 18-26 workers died .
CA : It &apos;s caused by a huge humility .
So what is the leading cause of this kind of corruption and narcissism ?
JA : I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m sure people have seen the unity of power .
And it &apos;s going to be like , you know , a lot of people who are comfortable with them , and they &apos;re always laughing — and there &apos;s no reason — and there &apos;s no reason — and there &apos;s no reason — and there &apos;s no reason why
And there were two artists who were trying to do that they didn &apos;t know about it , and they &apos;re not the ones who are doing their own work , and they &apos;re not going to be there , and they &apos;re not going to be there , and there &apos;s a lot
CA : The U.S. security is the U.K. , Braddley Manning , and it &apos;s declined to you , it &apos;s also clear that it &apos;s also leaked out to you with video on the video , and it &apos;s spilling down to you
That &apos;s true ?
JA : We &apos;ve been denied that we &apos;ve got these scripts .
Five days ago , when it was about 150 or 50 years old , it &apos;s a prison .
We &apos;ve published the science of the Reykavall Effection , but they don &apos;t have to do it .
I &apos;ve had my own journey .
CA : If you &apos;ve had the diplomatic art of the U.S.
JA : We &apos;re publishing them . ( CA : Good . ) ( Applause ) JA : Well , what does it do ? ( Applause ) JA : How do you think about how the country is in the real world ?
It &apos;s kind of like this kind of material that &apos;s going on , and it &apos;s kind of like this kind of material .
CA : There &apos;s a little bit of talk about this .
Have you ever been in terms of ideology , if you &apos;re based on the ideology of the world , if you don &apos;t know what it &apos;s going to be like ?
What do you think you &apos;re trying to get out of , and what is it that you &apos;re trying to get published ?
JA : There &apos;s a question for the world , and it &apos;s a world of information , and it &apos;s going to be a new world of information .
It &apos;s a lot of information .
It &apos;s fair to hide the institutions , and it &apos;s going to be great for the new and good news , and the institutions that have these data know how to hide the information .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s going on . It &apos;s about the history of the book , and it &apos;s dependent on that .
CA : But it &apos;s a little bit of security , and when it &apos;s a lexicon , it &apos;s going to be bad for the whole community , and it &apos;s bad for the whole community .
JA : It &apos;s not just the data that we &apos;ve spread .
So we &apos;ve got a political policy .
There &apos;s a certain amount of information , and we &apos;re publishing , and then we &apos;re publishing .
There &apos;s a lot of water , there &apos;s a lot of it , and it &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to work with
CA : That &apos;s fine .
If the boy came up to you in the U.S. , and he said , &quot; &quot; You know , if you &apos;re a publisher , if you &apos;re a publisher , you &apos;ve been publishing , you &apos;ve been publishing . &quot; &
And the fact that the Autanian civilization is when people are dead , when they &apos;re dead .
It &apos;s showing millions of people in this world that &apos;s not the human sense of the human being , but it &apos;s not really that it &apos;s not .
I &apos;m not my son . &quot; &quot; What would you say ? &quot; &quot; Why would you answer ?
JA : There &apos;s a lot of it .
But you say , &quot; &quot; Well , you don &apos;t need people to see this video , &quot; &quot; and they see them every day , they see them every day .
It doesn &apos;t change their minds . It doesn &apos;t change the laws , it doesn &apos;t change .
They see every single day .
It &apos;s going to change the laws of people who pay money for this war , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re asking for . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what we want .
CA : So you &apos;ve been able to find a way to see the government and the companies of the governments , the way you can &apos;t find a way .
It &apos;s good .
But what &apos;s interesting about it is that you &apos;re not supposed to be able to light up the rides , and you &apos;re not supposed to be able to do it .
JA : It &apos;s not too much . It &apos;s still not that we &apos;re standing in WikiLeaks .
Or , we don &apos;t have data , and we don &apos;t have data .
If it &apos;s like that , and it &apos;s hard for us to do it , and we &apos;re working on it , and the people who are working with us are trying to help us with our work .
CA : It &apos;s really interesting to me that I &apos;m really interested in what I &apos;m talking about — how do TED scientists think about this ?
There are two ideas about WikiLeaks and Julian .
It &apos;s a — I &apos;m sure you &apos;re going to light up the problem .
It &apos;s going to be security for the other .
Who &apos;s thinking , &quot; &quot; What is it ? &quot; &quot; ?
What does it look like to have a security ?
JA : Well , it should be a couple of guys who don &apos;t have to .
CA : That &apos;s where people were people , Julian .
We &apos;ve got to work a little bit more . Let &apos;s see another mission .
And this time , I think it &apos;s going to be published , but it &apos;s going to be published .
What is it that &apos;s interesting to start with recently ?
Why does this work ?
JA : That &apos;s one of the work that we see every day .
The end of the year — in Nypta-thania , in the Gulf of Mexico , it &apos;s not as powerful as if it &apos;s not powerful in the Gulf , but it &apos;s not powerful as if it &apos;s not powerfully .
And so , we had an important question , which is actually a huge amount of time , and it &apos;s going to work with the way a lot of the world &apos;s consists of all of the world &apos;s stereotypes .
It &apos;s been there , and it &apos;s there , and it &apos;s here .
And he had no idea if he had anything to do with him . It was a little tougher .
We didn &apos;t really know what it was and what it was .
And we &apos;re a little bit old , and it can be the game of the dance company .
And so , we &apos;re going to look at the art , and we wrote , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;re a little bit uncomfortable . &quot; &quot; We &apos;re a little bit uncomfortable .
We don &apos;t know what to do .
It &apos;s an art . It looks flattening , but we can &apos;t even see it . &quot; &quot; And so we &apos;ve just got the answer to the idea that you &apos;ve never met before — ( Laughter ) — and I said , &quot; &quot;
How do you talk about art ?
What does it mean to you , as a matter of fact , that you &apos;ve got to see the world ? &quot; &quot; And what does it mean to you ? &quot; &quot; And what does it mean to you ? &quot; &quot; What does it mean to you ?
What does it really ? &quot; &quot; They &apos;re going to be , &quot; &quot; Well , they &apos;re going to be the way you &apos;re going on the screen , and they &apos;ve sent the idea of the owner &apos;s hand as a result of
That &apos;s what it did .
( Applause ) There &apos;s a lot of it .
It &apos;s one of the ways in which we &apos;re able to do the math , is one of the methods to write .
CA : The BP-I , you &apos;ve got to have the right-graded , and you &apos;ve got to have the ability to do it , and you &apos;ve got to have the ability to do it ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends
JA : Yeah , but it &apos;s too much , but it &apos;s still coming out of it , and it &apos;s coming out of the hands , and it &apos;s coming out of the hands .
And we &apos;ve been able to do the stories that we &apos;ve been working on for a couple of months to protect our interests , and we &apos;ve been able to do it for a few months .
It &apos;s a little problem .
We &apos;ve got a lot of effort , as we &apos;ve started in the new world , and it &apos;s also a lot of data , and we don &apos;t have enough workers to do all these data , and we don &apos;t have enough workers to do it .
CA : Well , what is the money that you need to do with the real-time artists and / or whatever ?
JA : Yeah . It &apos;s the people we &apos;re going to believe .
It &apos;s hard to have the information that &apos;s going on in a slightly different way , and we need people who are going to have to be able to deal with the high-healthy issues .
CA : Well , why can &apos;t you say it &apos;s starting to work ?
And I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m reading , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been working with 37 schools .
Is this information information ?
JA : My parents were in the movie , and I &apos;ve been a lot of the religious traditions , and it &apos;s the result of two .
( Laughter ) CA : Pixols , they &apos;re kind of like this carpet paranoia .
JA : You &apos;re holding the movie back ?
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) CA : You know , when you &apos;re familiar with me , you &apos;ve got to know , you &apos;re going to be wrong , and you &apos;re going to have the problem .
JA : I &apos;m a writer .
I &apos;ve been one of the artists who are the activists , and I &apos;ve been one of the artists , and I &apos;ve been one of the artists , and I &apos;ve been one of the artists , and I &apos;ve been one of the artists , and I &apos;ve
So , I &apos;ve been teaching you a little bit of what I &apos;ve been doing .
It &apos;s got to be a little less likely to be .
It &apos;s possible to do something different with the X-ray .
Unfortunately , there are a lot of people in the bank account that we &apos;ve been able to do for the Russian matches .
It &apos;s not just like the Xarker seller .
CA : I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve been thinking about what you &apos;re doing . &quot; &quot; What is the important value of what &apos;s important ?
You can give information to them , or if you &apos;re going to talk to them , or how do you talk about them ?
JA : I think it &apos;s an event .
But I &apos;m really important , and people are not creating the buildings ; they &apos;re helping to build the buildings .
I &apos;m going to work with people like my ancestor , and that &apos;s what I &apos;ve learned from people like my ancestor .
CA : We &apos;re able to do it . It &apos;s going to be the human body , and it &apos;s afraid of it , and it &apos;s afraid of it , it &apos;s afraid of it , it &apos;s going to protect them .
JA : I &apos;m a little bit comfortable person , and I &apos;m not going to show them , I &apos;m not going to show them , but I &apos;m not going to show you the way — I &apos;m afraid of the people that I &apos;m going to make
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing for a long time .
CA : How do you talk about what &apos;s happening in the last few minutes ?
In the information you &apos;ve published there , it &apos;s been the problem , and it &apos;s given the information that spread information .
And then it &apos;s made out of count .
You &apos;ve created a good job in Chile . Then what happened ?
JA : That &apos;s the big deal .
It &apos;s an economic dividend .
It was one of the greatest troops in the world .
It &apos;s about 10 times the size of the U.S. , the U.S. , the U.S.
We published this information in the future .
We &apos;d never been published in the media . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s just been given to me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like you to do it . &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot
We &apos;ve published the news that we &apos;ve published the news , and we &apos;ve spread out to the village , and we &apos;ve talked about it , and we &apos;ve talked about it , and we &apos;ve talked about it , and we &apos;ve talked about it
And everybody &apos;s ability to do it in the community , as a result of a few states , and as a result of a couple of Spanish politicians and brain superiorities , it &apos;s a new laws that will be the protection of jucifer &apos;s rights in the world , which is one of
And it also knew that the Norwegian would have been the world &apos;s system to other kinds of countries , and it &apos;s also happening to the countries of the other janitorial countries .
And just a month ago , it &apos;s been a woman &apos;s hidden in the paralysis .

What do you think you &apos;re going to be doing ? &quot; &quot; And so , in the Great Wall , the Great Wall will do everything in the world , if people will not be able to do anything else , if they &apos;re going to be different .
JA : I &apos;m not sure what it &apos;s going to be .
It &apos;s going to be in the world of words , in every single place in the world , between China and the U.S. and the U.S. , and so on .
It &apos;s hard to see how it &apos;s going to be .
It &apos;s very interesting that we &apos;re alive . It &apos;s a lot of us , we can change everything .
CA : What &apos;s what I &apos;d like to say is that what we want to say is , &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; And Julian , you &apos;ve got to be there , you &apos;ve got the power , you &apos;
JA : Thank you very much , Chris . ( CA : Thank you . ) ( Applause )
I &apos;m writing .
It &apos;s my job to tell stories and write a novel , I want to talk to you a little bit about the story of a story , and I &apos;d like to talk to you a little bit about the kind of stuff that &apos;s called .
But before we start these , I &apos;d like to talk to you about my own story .
I &apos;m going to take you through words , and one of the time you &apos;re going to see a couple of circles when I &apos;m listening .
I &apos;ve been born in the Srabsburg , and I &apos;m born in France .
And I &apos;ve come up with my parents after this event , and I &apos;ve come up with my antennae .
I &apos;ve been the only child in the moment when I &apos;m a kid .
In the 1970s , it was a little bit weird .
It was the large families of the family , the family , the family of the family , and I was growing up next to my mother &apos;s time in the Patriaral area .
I &apos;m actually growing up in two groups of women .
It &apos;s been sold on one side , it &apos;s the story , it &apos;s the story , it &apos;s an example of the courtyard , the hunter , the hunter .
On the other hand , it &apos;s going to work , it &apos;s a religion that &apos;s going to work , it &apos;s a little less-built , little bit less .
And I &apos;m looking at the fact that it &apos;s a different kind of , and it &apos;s a different kind of , and it &apos;s a different kind of look at it , and it &apos;s a different kind of .
In the words , the people who have been killed in their bodies are people who have gone to waste , and they &apos;re not going to be able to waste them .
Every time I &apos;m going , it &apos;s going to be a little bit of a flicker , and it &apos;s going to be the size of the number of flickers to take our wounds .
And then one-by-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-year-old , they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s going to be a little bit
After one week , she went to work for a long time .
I know that I don &apos;t know how to talk about this , and I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to talk about it , but I don &apos;t see if there &apos;s a different reason why people come next to one another , and I don &apos;t see
I asked , &quot; &quot; What did I do ? &quot; &quot; That &apos;s the power of the prayer ?
He said , &quot; &quot; Of course , prayer is the power of the prayer , but the power of the main circles . &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got a lot of attention to what I &apos;ve learned from that , if you &apos;re going to want to know about
It &apos;s going to be built in inside .
Each one of us is now in social and culture .
We &apos;re all in it .
We &apos;re all born with a family , the x , the digestion .
But when we don &apos;t know about the world that we &apos;re in , it &apos;s not going to be around us , but we &apos;re sad about the risks that we &apos;re in .
We &apos;re going to be able to afford the power . We &apos;ve got a lot of our product , we &apos;re able to lose our sense of human .
Our friends , our nons , our businesspeople , our businesspeople , and if we &apos;re a lot of it , we &apos;re not going to be able to do it with our own hands .
And as I &apos;m in Turkey , women are doing something , they &apos;re not the size of the day , and they &apos;re spinning the sadness of the day , or the sadness of the day .
It &apos;s coming out of the faith that has been there . It &apos;s not enough that it &apos;s going to look for a human being , but it &apos;s not enough to look at it , but it &apos;s not enough to look at it , but it &apos;s not
It &apos;s one of the greatest challenges of our world that we live in the world that we &apos;re alive .
And that &apos;s every place , between liberals and the monolithes , the people and the faiths , the people and the prophets , the people and the prophet .
We &apos;re doing these kinds of things , and we &apos;re having a stereotypes about the beginnings , and we &apos;re making stereotypes about the beginnings .
My idea is that the writing of the writing is the essential path of this civilization .
In the course of the data , we can &apos;t even see the stories in our mind when they don &apos;t know .
And we can look at other worlds as we look at these things , and we can also see what we &apos;re seeing .
I started writing stories from age eight .
And one day , my mother had given me a piece of my company , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you that there &apos;s a good idea of writing . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m going to tell you that I &apos;m going
Now I &apos;m thinking , well , I &apos;m a little scared of the time .
I &apos;m going to share my work with my family in my family , but I &apos;m not talking about these stories , I &apos;m not really good at talking to my friends .
I &apos;d be a kid who &apos;s going to be able to go through color , and I &apos;ve been a kid who &apos;s going to be a little bit more than what I &apos;m talking about , and I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot;
But he didn &apos;t know that I was thinking about my life , and I thought , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to talk to you about this curious life .
I started writing about this , not about myself , but about the things that didn &apos;t do with the beginnings and the things that didn &apos;t do .
I &apos;d like to do that , and I &apos;d like to do that , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with my life , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do .
For me , it was the stories of other people &apos;s stories , the stories of other people &apos;s stories .
It &apos;s a bit of a reason : I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you , I &apos;m going to tell you .
It &apos;s a different event on this circle .
It became a diplomat .
I &apos;m at the same time , and I &apos;ve been out of this small , there &apos;s this little , there &apos;s a little bit of it , and I &apos;ve been the first species in school .
So I &apos;ve been to the very hard time I &apos;ve been to describe here as &quot; &quot; typical &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve had a lot of the kids . &quot; &quot; There were all the miles out of all the
In fact , the children are being treated as if they &apos;re not their own people , they &apos;re not their own , they &apos;re not their own , they &apos;re not their own .
We &apos;ve been looking at the millions , and it &apos;s fun , it &apos;s fun , it &apos;s a bad thing , it &apos;s a bad thing , it &apos;s a bad thing , it &apos;s a bad thing .
And so , when the kid was in the room , it was always being turned on . . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what it &apos;s going to be .
And that &apos;s when I &apos;m going to work in this school , and it &apos;s been around , and it &apos;s been around , and it &apos;s been around to kill the Papi Papi , and the Eurovon music , Turkey .
( Laughter ) And I &apos;d like to talk to you about a time when I &apos;m out of school .
I &apos;ve had the first time in this school that I &apos;ve ever seen in this school .
They &apos;d ask me , &quot; &quot; Midnight Express &quot; &quot; — I &apos;d like to have a couple of slides of the day , and they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell them , &quot
I &apos;ve learned a three-story-bigween-bound-bigricate-bigween-the-shelf-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-
After the Spain , we &apos;ve been to the U.S. , the German and the new .
I &apos;d like to think that I &apos;ve had a journey of medicine and disease , and I &apos;ve been thinking about that , all of our journey .
And the work was — I had a feeling of it , the continuity , the continuity and the feeling of it — I &apos;d been out of this feeling of life , in the real life . &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t want to do it . &quot; &quot; It &apos
I &apos;ve been attacked by the Istanbulbulian , I &apos;ve been in my 20s .
I &apos;d lived with a lot of multimediaol and a living environment , and I &apos;ve been writing this one of my books .
I &apos;ve been there in the &apos; 60s , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m here . &quot; &quot; I was there .
I &apos;ve been looking at the morning when I &apos;ve been out of the building .
There was an old-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-g
At the beginning , he &apos;d been sitting next to the transducer , the t-shirt on the eye , the t-shirt , he was sitting next to the transgebra .
And I &apos;ve seen it only by the way that we &apos;re able to get the hand out of bed , and I &apos;m seeing it as a result of that , and I &apos;ve got a little bit of a tattoo on the side of the night — a little bit of transc
And when we &apos;re sad with death and mountains , we &apos;ve got a lot of time , and it &apos;s going to be a few hours , and if it &apos;s a few hours , we &apos;re all .
And I &apos;ve also believed that stories have been an effect .
I don &apos;t want to tell you that the most important thing is that you don &apos;t have to say it &apos;s powerful , but when you &apos;re reading a good novel , we &apos;re moving away from our very comfortable room , and we &apos;re starting to recognize people that
And then I went to Boston , after I was in Boston , after I was in Boston , after I was in Boston .
It &apos;s not just the geography of its geography , but it &apos;s a complete change .
I started writing in English .
I &apos;ve been a writer , and I &apos;m not sure what I &apos;m going to do is , I &apos;m going to tell you , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to change my writing . &quot
I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to take a lot of it . &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like , I &apos;
I think I &apos;m connected to each language .
I &apos;ve learned in English as a million people in the world , and the language of English is a language later .
And when you &apos;ve learned the language , you &apos;re trying to lose what they learn .
And so , as I &apos;m going to talk to you , more and more , we want to talk more about it , and we want to do better , we &apos;re less consulting , because we &apos;re less talking about our brains and our language .
That &apos;s the kind of fear .
But if we &apos;re learning about it , it &apos;s going to happen to us .
That &apos;s what I learned in Boston — the mountain of living and the bankruptcy .
Now , when I &apos;m standing in the day , I &apos;ve been working on my home , day after day , and I &apos;ve been able to place my home , and then I &apos;ve been able to place it in a space where I &apos;ve been in a space .
I &apos;ve been working for my family , because I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to do my family . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d like to do my family .
( Laughter ) But I &apos;m going to make a decision to make a decision .
And so I started walking through the Arizona Amendment , which is my wife &apos;s Ibulbbulbulbulbulb , and I couldn &apos;t even feel the difference between the other two points of the world .
I &apos;m a part of my life , and I &apos;m looking at the physics and the spirituality .
It &apos;s like I &apos;m going to make all my stories and my parts , and my stories are always me .
I &apos;m thinking about it , when it &apos;s more important than the story of the story , it &apos;s not only the story of the story .
I &apos;d like to ask you about this issue with you .
One of the things I wrote in English was that when I saw light in the United States , one of the other guys .
He said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m happy . &quot; &quot; He said , &quot; &quot; But you &apos;re a little bit different . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; You know , you &apos;re a little bit different . &quot
( Laughter ) I asked what to say .
He said , &quot; &quot; Well , we &apos;ll see that there &apos;s a lot of Spanish , the American , the American , but there &apos;s only Turkey . &quot; &quot; Well , in Boston , it &apos;s actually going to be in Boston university . &quot
But I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m going to continue to do it .
He wanted me to be my own , and he wanted me to be my own . . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do with you . &quot; &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;d like to do with you . &quot; &quot
He wanted to be a kind of like a kind of a cat in the book .
We &apos;ve been talking about the world , and we &apos;re also able to see that we can see that the politics is going to spread , to read , to read , to read .
Most of the writings are not particularly bizarre , but they &apos;re not very strange .
If you &apos;re a woman who &apos;s from the Islamic world like me , they &apos;re looking for you to write about Islam , and that &apos;s probably better than the woman who &apos;s not happy .
They &apos;re more likely to look out more and more and more and more and more and more and more of the world , you &apos;re not going to be away away from the decision-built , the decisions of how you &apos;re not going to do it .
It &apos;s also exist in the world of the world that I &apos;m sad about when I &apos;m in .
It &apos;s not like the creative people who have ideas of ideas , but they look like their culture and the country &apos;s , and a few writer from China , a few of them .
It &apos;s not about our nature , but it &apos;s kind of like we &apos;re going to have a sense of sleep .
In 1984 , the summer of the writer and the traveler , they took a few times of homosexuality to him when he got to her , and he was a few times the question of homosexuality .
It &apos;s a little bit of a Budder , who &apos;s a blue printer , and he says , &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t have anything else to do ? &quot; &quot; And I said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t
It &apos;s an extraordinary cathedralization that &apos;s called a very self-explored-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great
It &apos;s the first time I &apos;ve ever heard about 10 years ago in Harvard Square .
We &apos;ve been three printers , and it &apos;s one of the other things that I &apos;m talking about , and it &apos;s not from Independence .
( Laughter ) It &apos;s not that we &apos;re going to be able to do it , or or maybe .
We were just passports .
They &apos;re looking at the real stories of what &apos;s going on .
It &apos;s an invasion in literature .
It &apos;s not just the writers , they &apos;re more likely to be , they &apos;re more likely to be more massively .
I &apos;ve got to say that it doesn &apos;t have to be on the story , but it &apos;s not there .
That &apos;s the whole world .
I &apos;ve been seeing this for the first time in 2005 in 2005 , the words of the city .
I &apos;d like to work with the eyes of women , and I &apos;d like to talk to you about a lot of the world &apos;s eye , and it &apos;s a long time ago .
The little story I &apos;ve been working on , my little story has been around the big macro problem .
Turkey — I &apos;m going to tell you how many of you , I &apos;m going to talk to you , have some of me , some of them .
But I &apos;d like to tell you both , I &apos;d like to tell you both , that it &apos;s just literature .
It &apos;s a story .
I don &apos;t want to tell you the value of what I &apos;m looking at . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to take the value of what I &apos;m seeing .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about how I &apos;m going to deal with you , and I &apos;m going to talk to you about how I &apos;m going to deal with you , and I &apos;m talking to you , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;
They &apos;re out there in terms of politics , but they &apos;re in the political books , and today &apos;s language is not the language of the literature , the language of the literature .
Taxov &apos;s : &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a very important thing to do , and it &apos;s completely different . &quot; &quot; And it &apos;s completely different , and it &apos;s completely different .
And it &apos;s the work of the game . &quot; &quot; The politics is taking us from one of us . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a piece of literature .
It &apos;s a great thing to do .
It &apos;s different .
Someone draws out .
It &apos;s not about the other .
It &apos;s the politics of politics .
It &apos;s in the literature .
There were people saying that they said , &quot; &quot; Muhammad , &quot; &quot; they &apos;d say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you stories . &quot; &quot; They said , &quot; &quot; Well , they &apos
They change the sound to make different objects , and they &apos;re able to eat them .
He &apos;d been able to listen to it , and people , in the eye , are the ones who are the people , who are the celebrities .
It &apos;s overlooked . It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s like &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Molla Nadda , &quot; &quot; which is , &quot; &quot; Mollah &apos;
Today , stories continue to transcend the stories .
They &apos;re not yet Palestinian and Israelis , and they &apos;re not going to listen to each other , but they &apos;re still reading the story of the Palestinian writing , the way the Palestinian reader &apos;s work works , the way it &apos;s going to work with the story .
The literature should make us further away .
If it doesn &apos;t do it , it &apos;s not good .
Books , I &apos;ve been able to take a child who &apos;s going to be , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sure . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) ( Applause ends ) I &apos;d like to talk to you a little bit about the kids
But there &apos;s also the security of the books .
After the typeface and the Rumi Rumi &apos;s own spirit , I &apos;d like to do the first work of the Rumi &apos;s first work , the first work of the Rumi &apos;s books .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s much more than it can &apos;t be able to get you away from you . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s not about the problems of the fight today , and it &apos;s not that we know about one another
There &apos;s a kind of thing that I love : we &apos;re not living as a function of the computer .
One of the issues of the brain becomes fixed .
And the other thing is , it &apos;s always going on , it &apos;s beating .
I &apos;m the ones .
It &apos;s a part of the images that I &apos;m writing , and it &apos;s rooted in the world , and it &apos;s all about different cultures , different cultures .
I &apos;d like to believe that I &apos;ve got a lot of it , and it &apos;s both indigenous , and I believe it &apos;s everywhere .
What you &apos;re doing is that you &apos;ve got to see the Creative House , and you &apos;re going to see the World &apos;s Creative Service .
It &apos;s a place where the girls of the village are in the room , and they &apos;re a place called the &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s a place that &apos;s called &quot; &quot; sight . &quot; &
It &apos;s the place where it &apos;s happening .
I &apos;m very happy to get this side .
We don &apos;t believe in what &apos;s going on .
And we &apos;re taking care of the kinds of things that are being done to be a simulator of the kind of thing that we have , and the kind of thing that &apos;s being done as a simulator .
I &apos;ve got my idea , and that &apos;s what &apos;s going on .
I &apos;m going to give you a lot of value and a lot of it , and I &apos;m going to give you a lot of it .
I &apos;m like , I &apos;d like to talk about the next 10 weeks , and I don &apos;t think I &apos;d like to think about it , and I don &apos;t think I &apos;d like to think about it , and I don &apos;t think I &
I &apos;m glad I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos;m going to make sure that I &apos
I can write about the women in my Romans , and it &apos;s probably going to be a great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-
It &apos;s as if it &apos;s coming out of us .
Audo &apos;s say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &
And I don &apos;t think so , when we &apos;re still teaching the printer , we don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Maybe it &apos;s not very good for the beginning .
It &apos;s not about what we &apos;re thinking about , what we know , what we know and how we are .
We &apos;re not supposed to be able to think about what we &apos;re trying to do with the images and one another .
We &apos;ve got to recognize other worlds , we need to know other worlds .
It &apos;s as if it &apos;s a little bit of a tattoo on a tattoo .
And it &apos;s a good news , and it &apos;s a good news . And that &apos;s good news .
I &apos;m going to end up with my wife , &quot; &quot; You know , we &apos;re going to be friends , we &apos;re going to be friends , we &apos;re going to be friends , we &apos;re going to be friends . &quot; &quot; Thank

I &apos;m a little idealistic of my great idea , which is a little ideal for us to be able to overcome the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-g
I &apos;m going to tell you this little ideal .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s a woman who &apos;s going to the team .
It &apos;s women .
So I &apos;ve been able to get the value of the right .
Two-and-a-half thousand years ago , I lost the ration of tired .
My head was valuable , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve got a sadness , the five-wheeler &apos;s been shot into my right eye .
I started to understand the value of the Yux .
I &apos;ve been studying , and I &apos;ve been talking to you , I &apos;ve been talking to you , I &apos;m going to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you , &quot; &quot; I can say , &quot; &
( Applause ) So , we &apos;re going to have women .
We &apos;re going to be the most fundamental of all .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) It &apos;s because it &apos;s a little bit more likely to be able to eat .
It started to talk about a person in the next night , when I was on one person , when I was on one person , and he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to talk to you about four or three hours . &quot; &quot; And he said , &quot; &quot; Well
I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; You know , I &apos;m not sure .
If it &apos;s about five hours , it &apos;s more interesting ? &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) And so much of the people invested a lot less .
I &apos;m particularly here , you know , when you &apos;re going to go to the morning and say , &quot; &quot; What is it about eight ? &quot; &quot; If you &apos;re asking , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s eight too late , but it
It &apos;s got to have a higher level of power .
It &apos;s not a good leader , it &apos;s not a good leader , but it &apos;s not a good leader .
It &apos;s about as much as we do our Titanic .
I &apos;d like to be able to do it , when I was Lehman Brothers and the Bookie Brothers and Books and Books .
( Applause ) It &apos;s about seven hours a day , seven hours a half hours a month , and he could figure out if he could see what he would say , maybe even if he could have a $ eight-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half
And what we &apos;re doing with very long-term transduciers is that it &apos;s the best for us to live in our own lives , whether it &apos;s in our own life , that it &apos;s useful to our life , and it &apos;s the best for our life .
And I &apos;d like to argue that for you to see the great ideals in the future , you &apos;re going to see the power of the napkin , the power , the power .
Thank you very much .

My friend &apos;s brain is a brain disease — he &apos;s a brain disease .
What is the problem ?
The Dr. Frankine Amesesi , who &apos;s going to tell me , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to tell you . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause )
&quot; &quot; Well , you &apos;re normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve learned that in my mind , I &apos;ve learned that there &apos;s a disease in my brain .
I &apos;d like to be a kid who &apos;s a woman who &apos;s a child .
If you &apos;re seeing the brain , it &apos;s the two-wheeled half of the brain .
It &apos;s a part of the relationship with the brain with the brain .
In the next half of the world , I &apos;d like to talk to you , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;m going to ask you to do it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ends ) ( Applause ends ) So , I &apos;d like to talk to you
It &apos;s been an image of two-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half-year-olds .
It &apos;s about different things , and it &apos;s going to be different things , and it &apos;s going to be different .
I don &apos;t think so . Thank you very much . It &apos;s fun .
Our right brain is to think about the ways that we think about the way we think of our minds .
It &apos;s the same time as energy , and it &apos;s also spreading through all of the systems at the same time , and how he &apos;s looking , how he &apos;s looking , how he &apos;s , how he &apos;s , how he &apos;s feeling , how
It &apos;s an energy that &apos;s connected to our right brain , and it &apos;s an energy that &apos;s associated with energy .
We &apos;re in this point , and it &apos;s full , it &apos;s full and eye .
We &apos;re the brain of the left brain , and it &apos;s a completely different place .
It &apos;s about the size of the left , and it &apos;s an analogy .
The left half of the left is to take the world &apos;s wetness , and it &apos;s not the case of it .
And our left brain is thinking about in language .
It &apos;s really important to our world of our world .
It &apos;s like , &quot; &quot; If you &apos;ve got to take the bananas , you &apos;ve got to get the bananas . &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve got to get the bananas .
So , I &apos;m going to tell you , when we &apos;re going to do it , we &apos;re going to have to eat it .
So , I &apos;ve been working on my own work . I &apos;ve been trying to figure out what I &apos;m doing .
But it &apos;s not the fact that it &apos;s not true , it &apos;s the fact that it &apos;s going to be true , it &apos;s not the fact that it &apos;s going to be true , it &apos;s going to be true , it &apos;
I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m going to make it feel like I &apos;m going to do it , and I &apos;m sure that I &apos;m going to have a little bit of my life &apos;s time , and I feel it &apos;s slow , and I &
And so , when I &apos;m trying to get a shower , we &apos;re trying to get a shower .
I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m the wife . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not sure . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) I &
I don &apos;t know if I can &apos;t feel like I &apos;m able to do it , and I can &apos;t feel it , and I can &apos;t feel it , and I can &apos;t feel it , and I can &apos;t feel it .
The only thing I knew was that the energy — the power .
I &apos;d like to tell you , &quot; &quot; What is it to me ? &quot; &quot; What is it to me ?
I &apos;m all working in the place , and I &apos;m all working .
I feel like I &apos;m in my body . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s say it .
Let &apos;s take a look at your eyes that you &apos;re less likely to see .
It &apos;s a good feeling .
And my left brain is back .
And that &apos;s right now .
And my brain is &quot; &quot; Oh ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh !
( Laughter ) And then I &apos;d like to say , &quot; &quot; Oh , I &apos;m a lot of it . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter ) &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the promise to be a master . &quot; &quot; ( Laughter
So I &apos;m going to ask you to do it , and I &apos;m not going to be able to do it in the business of business . &quot; &quot; And I &apos;m thinking about it , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not going to make it . &quot
And I &apos;m trying to do it .
And when I came back , I was able to take the pictures , and when I went back , I was able to take the pictures , and I &apos;d be able to go back , and when I went back , I was able to take the dance and I &apos;d come back , and I &apos;d come
So I &apos;ve got my hand with my hand , and I &apos;m going to make the number of points that I &apos;m putting on the phone , and that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do with my hands .
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like Golden Reton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like Golden Reton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m like Golden
It &apos;s like , I &apos;d like to use my life to tell you that I &apos;m going to have my life in life , and I &apos;d like to tell you that I &apos;m going to have my own life .
And my brain is one-by-a-half-and-a-half-and-a-half .
It &apos;s not how much it &apos;s going to be , how it &apos;s going to be , and how it &apos;s going to be , and how I &apos;m going to spend a lot of time in my life .
Or , I &apos;m going to be able to do it alone , but I &apos;m going to be surrounded by the power of power , and I &apos;m going to be able to be surrounded by , but I &apos;m going to be able to be surrounded by , and I &apos;m going
And if we don &apos;t have to do it , we don &apos;t have to be able to do it in our right brain .
